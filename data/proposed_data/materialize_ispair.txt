issue: Hey! Does anyone know how I could make this work?:I have a PHP session, called message -> so when someone enters there email wrong it would say "Wrong Email" - I want to change it up and put a toast in there, I got this atm but ofc it does not work:`$_SESSION['message'] = "Materialize.toast('I am a toast!', 4000)";` - how could I make it work? 
solution: 

issue: @TomWilson10  use jquery or JavaScript for toast a value can't use PHP directly to show flash message.  for example `var $NoticeToast = $('.notice');if($NoticeToast.length){Materialize.toast($(".notice").text(), 3000, 'rounded')    $(".notice").remove();} `html`<p class="notice">any message to show</p>`

issue: Hey guys, I'm wondering if there is a solution to reset the css inside of a certain part of a page. I'm currently using materializecss for https://cargo.vision inside of rails and it really is an awesome project. Thanks for that! I've just build a new part of the page using react and now I'm running into an issue where no inputs are showing up since they are reset from materializecss. I'm on this for like 2 days now and I can't wrap my head around how to solve it. Maybe someone's got an idea. Would really appreciate some help :)

solution: 

issue: I never tried it but it looks like the a tag is used internally. You might want to try a little bit javascript and use the onclick handler I suppose he uses a tags to retrieve the click event on the images. making it easier for the library to work. (so he can change the images accordingly. Just use onclick=function() on the image itself and maybe you can imitate the correct behavior

solution: I am trying to make a full screen landing page with the navbar at the top and a button with some text at the center of the slider. 

issue: can we dynamically change  collapisible type , ie switch between data-collapsible="expandable" and data-collapsible="accordion", I tried to add it. but seems not working. In html source change of  attr is reflecting. but collapsible behaviour is not changing.. 
solution: 

issue: @KilianB  Thanks! It worked. I was  trying to change attr like this--"$(collapsible).attr("data-collapsible", "expandable");"  , I am new to web programming..what is the difference ? 
solution: The attribute you changed alters the attribute on the actual dom object on the page, which might work in some very easy cases. If you exactly want to know what the call to $() collapsible does you have to look at the source code but it's probably a longer javascript function which creates ALL the correct attributes and sets proper event handlers under the hood.. 

issue: The attribute ia probably generated and not directly used for initialization. 
solution: 

issue: Anyone know what's wrong with these modal options (Materializecss 1.0). It doesn't stop anything from working, though changing values has no effect, and I'm not good enough with JS syntax yet to see it:```javascript    <script>        $(document).ready(function(){            $('.modal').modal({                    dismissible: true, // Modal can be dismissed by clicking outside of the modal                    opacity: .1, // Opacity of modal background                    inDuration: 300, // Transition in duration                    outDuration: 1000, // Transition out duration                    startingTop: '40%', // Starting top style attribute                    endingTop: '10%', // Ending top style attribute                }            );        });    </script>``` I'm also trying to make a floating button at the bottom instead of a flat, but changing from "btn-flat" to "btn" does nothing. 
solution: 

issue: I see. I still link JQuery externally, so I guess I could use the first code that I have now. But why isn't it behaving differently when I change for example inDuration? I think I'll wait with 1.0 for now. For 0.1, I got it working by removing the last comma, so:```endingTop: '10%', // Ending top style attribute```..was changed to..```endingTop: '10%' // Ending top style attribute``` This also fixed the issue of changing btn-flat to btn not working. 
solution: 

issue: I wanted to use the onOpenStart option in the modal() function to customize the modal dialog before it was shown. But it looks like the trigger parameter is undefined the very first time I open a modal dialog. (I need the trigger parameter to access an attribute of that element) From the second time on, the trigger parameter is correctly initialized. It always works correctly in onOpenEnd. Is it a known issue?

issue: Using 1.0 Alpha, I'm trying to enable a select when I choose an option from another select. I see that just setting disable to false does not work because as I can see in the inspector, it is removed, but select has an input attached with a readonly true defined. If I set this readonly to false it is enabled, but exist any function in 1.0 Alpha to do it? 
solution: 

issue: This is a javascript/Jquery issue isn't it? You can add an onclick handler to the button and work your way from there. This doesn't have anything to do with components. 
solution: 

issue: Is there a way for hide or remove dinamically specific options in a select using jQuery? I'm using version 1.0 Alpha visibility hidden, display none does not work. Thank you guys 
solution: 

issue: Thanks Daniel, I just turned the <a implementation into <button and moved on. Cause the button's disabled-ness implementation absolutely rocks.  [disabled]="!f.form.valid" .. But I keep confusing this gitter with angularized version of the materialize. I apologize for that. MaterializeCss is an awesome UI library but not everything works within angular. even ng2 materialize does not work out of the box. So I keep coming up with creative solutions to replace what is supposed to work from the get go. 
solution: 

issue: It's not as obvious in the image as I had imagined it would be, sorry, but there seems to be some empty white space that pushes it over. For now I am trying the following work-around:```label input[type=checkbox] ~ span:empty {    padding-left: 0;}``` Sure, I'll see if I can whip up a codepen example for you Could you post a link for the preferred template? (I thought there was one somewhere but I can't seem to find the link at the moment) @DanielRuf https://codepen.io/jacobq_/pen/opyLmR I would like to override the default grey color for labels on checkboxes and radio buttons but not text inputs. Since the label now wraps the input element it seems hard to target now (since we can't have parent selectors). What's the best way to do this? Should I override `label`'s global style then add back for `.input-field label`?

solution: 

issue: @glauco486 cards are `div`s that take up the size of their container. Putting them in column of the grid allows for sizing and positioning them, and gives you the control on how they will behave when the browser windows is resized or the page is viewed on a larger/smaller screen. If you know how many cards you put in a row and/or the size you gave them you can "offset" the first to center them all... look here:https://codepen.io/giovalerio/pen/aEadGXotherwise you have to put them in a container and use CSS to set the left and right margin to auto...

solution: @DanielRuf no im directing referencing cdns at the moment in my index. 

issue: i cannot figure it out for the life of me i have tried a few different ways but i wasnt able to figure it out but mostly i have copied the code that they provided in the materialize forms documentation and pasted it and it didnt work the rest of them did but that one did not. i tried putting the nouislider css and js in there to get it to work but it still never worked if anyone could help me id very much appreciate it! i did that as well it didnt work 
solution: 

issue: i looked at the nouisliders and i didnt like their design but i was able to get that to work but i like the design of the materilize  range sliders but for some reason i just cant get it to work no matter what i do i got the minified CSS and JS from Cdnjs 
solution: 

issue: yes, but materialize uses modified noUISlider, so you have to include that to your project;"To use the noUiSlider, you will have to manually link the nouislider.css and nouislider.js files located in the extras folder." 
solution: 

issue: could this be somehow on their end or is it on ours? i tried surrounding it with form tags too just in case because it is a form and that didnt work then i tried setting the height and width and position and that didnt work the only thing that i can try to do is maybe initialize it but it didnt say it needed to be initialized on the documentation 
solution: 

issue: @nh916 similarly it doesn't work on my end either 
solution: 

issue: Whenever I put an image in a parallax container, it gets wonky. I'm getting the sense I shouldn't try to, is that correct? (an extra image, not the image for the background)

Ok so I see that roboto was removed about two months ago here - https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/commit/6f3a707b922067e8826bc5024b2977ad5b8fbd58 But last NPM release was 5 months ago it is at 0.100.2 currently no, it does not have that variable you linked. yes I see now there is a v1 alpha

issue: Hello. I'm new one from Russia)Firstly, I want to express my gratitude to the developers and say thank you for your project.

Sorry, if my language has some mistakes. 
solution: 

issue: @DanielRuf Sorry, too difficult.Oh, almost done.// within pushpin.jsfunction _setupEventHandlers() {    this.options.container.addEventListener('scroll', Pushpin._updateElements);}_updatePosition() {    var scrolled = this.options.container.scrollTop + this.options.offset;    ...}// within main file$this.pushpin({    ...,    container: $('#modal-1-content')[0] Works almost fine

solution: 

issue: @sean2775786355 I guess you use Materialize v1 
solution: Which uses `$('.modal).open();`. 

issue: when I use chrome ,it show me the error!    but I use Edge   or codeopen  ,there is no error! 
solution: 

issue: @sean2775786355 why not initialize it before and use the `data-target` attribute? https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ypdORy

issue: hey guys! I keep getting this error in angular 5 app when i am using materializecss: Uncaught ReferenceError: anime is not defined. cant figure out why 
solution: 

issue: Where can I change the output of the Time picker?  Currently if using AM/PM, it appends the AM/PM right after the minutes (ex: 11:55AM).  Typical time format is hh:mm tt, so I'd like it to display as 11:55 AM (a space between the minutes and the AM) 
solution: 

issue: RE: Tab. The docs are not accurate. Use 'select', NOT 'select_tab' to trigger a tab change. 
solution: 

issue: Ideally, I would be able to hide the tab,  and have the remaining tabs resize (tabs-fixed-width) to the available area. I was considering calling destroy, and re-initting the object. Lemme give it a try. Previously, I was adding and removing a class I made called "hidden". What's odd, is something seems to be overwriting my changes to the DOM elements. using hide() on the element or parent, behaves the same, if I hide it, and then try to show it, it doesn't change state I'll post a message here if I solve the problem or can reproduce it in CodePen. 
solution: 

issue: Maybe i'm on the wrong track but my suggestion would be to find the link element, and setting its parent to hidden. so $('#whatIWantToHide').parent().hide(); or you could find it through $('[href="#myCurrentTabId"]').parent().hide(); they should resize to fit the container, but im not 100% sure on that Interesting, i'll take a look here in a sec np :) 
solution: 

issue: Right on, thanks for the help! Also, is there a way to not use IDs for the tab's contents? Can I explicitly supply a selector instead? 
solution: 

issue: Okay, i got show/hide to work for the tabs.  I guess you dont need to call the parent, you can just do it on the A element.````$(document).ready(function() {  $('#close').click(function() {    $('#toHide').parent().hide();  });  $('#open').click(function() {    $('#toHide').parent().show();  });});```` 
solution: 

issue: So, the hide()/show() works only the first time. The tabs are in a Modal div. When the Modal is closed, and reopened, the issue is there. 
solution: Ahh, i see. So once you close the modal and re-open it are you unable to hide the tab, or it just resets it to visible again?. It keeps the state set the first time a hide()/view() is called. Once it's set, it stays set. FYI, the same thing happens when I add/remove the "disabled" class.. 

issue: RE: Tab in Modal issue - I moved the init call: $('ul.tabs').tabs();  to the "onOpenEnd" handler of the modal, it's working. 
solution: 

issue: given only two columns (left, right) in a row, how can I swap their position on small devices? that is, on m+ they should be row(left, right) but on small they should be row(right, left) 
solution: 

issue: I tried with push & pull but it is not behaving as expected, unless I misunderstand. basically I just 'push-s12' the left column and 'pull-s12' the right column, but that doesn't work nevermind... got it to work 
solution: 

issue: Hi there, have been trying to add an onAutocomplete function to a chips input.  The documentation suggests that chips can take autocompleteOptions - and indeed, it works for the data and for minLength, but doesn't seem to work for the onAutocomplete.  Any ideas?(perhaps I should add, that what I am really trying to achieve, is to be able to tell whether an added chip was the result of an autocomplete, or just the user typing something else and pressing return) @reckerswartz  Yeah, am happy to - that's why I want to use the onAutocomplete option, but I can't get chips to take it :( 
solution: 

issue: I don't know if it works or not, but you can just place a span inside your td element and truncate that.

solution: 

issue: Nevermind, it was my mistake. I initialized the vue app like this:```<body id="app">  </body>```After Vue finishes to render the page the `body` tag is replaced with a `div`, that's why materialize was not working.

solution: 

issue: So at the same time, when you use radios it doesn't set the checked attribute either. It does however work.I just checked a site that uses radiobuttons. They don't show up in the inspector but they do submit correctly with the form. Only thing I could suggest is setting a name attribute (you'll need that to get it out of POST anyway), and a value attribute

issue: Codepen is free. Clone https://codepen.io/Dogfalo/pen/xbzPQV if you use materialize 0.100.x, for 1.x you have to update the css and js tab settings accordingly. 
solution: 

issue: You can use codepen for showing the code. https://codepen.io/Dogfalo/pen/xbzPQV

solution: 

issue: @zineb007 This is a problem of jQuery version. Its breaking on v3. If you downgrade it works properly 
solution: 

issue: @developeranirudhprabhu if this is the case someone should bisect jQuery and open an issue at jquery/jquery on GitHub @alamis you need at least a `<main>` element to make it work. 
solution: 

issue: I agree with @developeranirudhprabhu , if it's a major release from jQuery they are gonna break backwards compatibility, if materialize doesn't adapt to it it just means that materialize utilizes an older version of jQuery, not that they "introduced" a bug

issue: @developeranirudhprabhu On initial data I can set an id field for each of the chips, see below:$('.chips-autocomplete').material_chip({ data:  [  {   tag: 'Apple',   id: 1  } ], autocompleteOptions:  {  data:   {   'Apple': null, // How can I put an id field here ?? <<===   'Microsoft': null, // How can I put an id field here ?? <<===   'Google': null // How can I put an id field here ?? <<===  },  limit: Infinity,  minLength: 1 }});So we can start with a set of data, each of them with and id. But, if I add a new chip from autocomplete list, that newly added chip would not have an id.'Microsoft': null, // How can I put an id field here ?? <<===

issue: Hi. All my JS components don't work anymore after migrating to beta. I use JQuery to initialize them by the way. They used to work before. :( 
solution: 

issue: autocomplete works fine in web, but in mobile seems like its buggy. I can't scroll down the result. even in http://materializecss.com/autocomplete.html its still buggy. it will select when I try to scroll the result. 
solution: 

issue: @YuManZz Actually I am having some problem at the moment. Can you please confirm if my command is correct or not? I also want to add that on calling that code, as I said, the modal closes immediately, but the modal backdrop remains in place properly How can I prevent the Modal from ***closing*** in that case? 
solution: @mrigankpawagi But I don't know if you have another thing who close your modal. 

issue: @YuManZz  It seems I have some error on my own end, because putting the required code in that CodePen seems to work 
solution: 

issue: Show me your codepen @mrigankpawagi To open it you use the modal trigger ? @mrigankpawagi So how you did it ? With js function ? 
solution: 

issue: When you have your problem ? On the first modal open or between the both ? 
solution: The problem is when I open `#modal2`. It opens, along with its backdrop. and then Immediately closes, while its backdrop remains as it was. 

issue: yes @YuManZz , cards take up more space and the user need to scroll a lot to get some X content. any other suggestion would help

issue: @Frederik-Witte why are you using setTimeout 0?Btw its interesting, but i don't see the point of this!?I mean the dropdown on the website works just fine.Anyway here is a code i used earlier to detect if you click outside of one element. Maybe u could use it$(document).on("click", "body", function(e){  var container = $(".element-container");   if (!container.is(e.target) && container.has(e.target).length === 0)   {    if($(".element-container .childelement").is(":visible")){                             //hide the childelement    }else{                           //show the childelement                        }   }});

solution: 

issue: But it gives me the error ```Uncaught TypeError: $(...).datepicker is not a function```

issue: Can you help me about, Probably something else regarding this I noticed, the version of Materialize I have v0.100.2 And the one I used on JSFIDDLE is 1.0.0 So, should I migrate straight away Or is there anything That can probably harm the code already present on my site?

solution: 

issue: @talyaron materialize-loader haven't been updated in the last 7 months, it can contain outdated code. So don't use it. But the main error is inside of that config file. Look up one of the old materialize-css sources and figure out what does that _color.scss contains and try to re-link it in the config file...but i think it's just not going to work 
solution: 

issue: ..jeez..this kid...okay. This thing is basically tabs. Read more here: http://materializecss.com/tabs.html I didnt used it, and im travelling now but if you use the active attribute i think it will work. $("li").removeAttr("active");$("li #mytabid").attr("active",""); 
solution: 

issue: I dont think so Because Active Tab has the `active` CLASS instead But that isn't actually working 
solution: 

issue: Can we ***virtually*** `click()` on the tabs? Well I was right about that virtual Click I was able to do that without reverse engineering Here's what I used    $("nav .nav-content ul.tabs .tab a").eq(1).click(); But atleast you dont needa mess with code, right? The code was anyways too complex

issue: Hey!  I'm having issues with the checkboxes I can't seem to get the value of them, and each time they are clicked the entire page jumps to the top [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/Nabd/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/Nabd/image.png) I know there are a lot of extra attributes, but that shouldn't break anything er, ```html<p>  <label for="edit-character-form-input-public">    <input type="checkbox" id="edit-character-form-input-public" class="filled-in">    <span>Make this character public</span>  </label></p>``` there's a simplified version however, when i tick it i cannot seem to get the updated value using jQuery `$("#edit-character-form-input-public").val()` always returns `on` assigning arbitrary ID's to the ones on Materialize's demo page even (with inspector) i still get the same issue I attempted to make a codepen but cannot even seem to make it render whatsoever there 
solution: 

issue: help me with the footer ... please 
solution: @YisusW use position: fixed. or wait.... add `position: fixed` to the CSS for the footer is what I think he is saying. 

issue: if you want to  appear at the bottom of the page...u have to place your footer at the bottom of your html document or make sure your framework renders it last...  you may also want to reset the margin for your footer?? i'm not sure until i can see your code 
solution: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/yKpebr Here's the pen for my issue. http://materializecss.com/footer.html if you want a footer to always be at the bottom of the page use this code @YisusW.

solution: 

issue: @smileytechguy Well, it's not much of a problem, but when you tend to be a fast mouse user, you will drag it a bit... which is why I want to stop it.@HunWalk The site will be on SSL later.

[![sample.png](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/QvPT/thumb/sample.png)](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/QvPT/sample.png) so the black box represents the image and the red box represents the search box

issue: Hi I'm hoping I can get some help with a form I'm making specifically 2 elements I can't get to work 
solution: 

issue: Thanks @NJM8 But what I meant is a weird issue, it's not the border bottom on `focus`, it's an extra border that just appear when you type in mobile: 
solution: 

issue: it can be reproduced in the materialize-css website itself I thought it was my code, but it's happening from the framework @NJM8 don't worry, thank you anyways 
solution: 

issue: @NJM8 it's a non-framework related issue. It's Google chrome itself who is putting this border. That solves this matter apparently 
solution: 

issue: Has anyone gotten the drop-downs to work in 1.0.0-beta?

issue: $('select').formSelect(); error when in  modal() inside load();  ... error: $()formSelect() is not a function... 
solution: 

issue: @HunWalk  but, as my timelines are hectic and haven't worked on react before, so I have to stick with angular 
solution: 

issue: @HunWalk so can I use modals of materialize if I go with angular? I have seen some ppl facing issues 
solution: Yes it should work but you may want to include jquery and open modals with that inside of your controllers. It should work just fine without that, but if youre stuck then use it.

solution: 

issue: @LazosPlaying Sorry for my late answer, but I am not shure if I understand your code example. It doesnt show the autocomplete close function, right?

issue: @matrixbot well now it's saying M is not defined 
solution: 

issue: `ep0ch` Are you using the minified version of material? If so use the non min version 
solution: 

issue: @matrixbot materialize.js:17 Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined    at materialize.js:17 
solution: 

issue: `ep0ch` jQuery either isn't being loaded or it's not being loaded first `ep0ch` Which version of materialize are you using? I'm pretty sure they removed the jQuery dependency at some point, so if you don't want/need jQuery you don't have to load it, just switch to using the latest version of materialize `ep0ch` Plus the documentation is based on the latest version and I know a lot of the JS init stuff for certain components has changed in recent versions, so using the latest would be your best bet 
solution: 

issue: `ep0ch` Columns and rows as in the built in grid system? Or as in a table? 
solution: not sure it seems like it wasn't designed for this. 

issue: @matrixbot i wasn't using jQuery and am using the latest version, but i've switched to jQuery and added it to my code to stop the error 
solution: 

issue: Thanks for trying @matrixbot , I guess I'll wait to see if anyone else is running into this issue. For the time being I can work around it using flex-box on the parent element:```css {    display: flex;    justify-content: center;}``` 
solution: 

issue: `ep0ch` Alright, just making sure that the init actually has an effect, like it's not initializing before the tabs are loaded or something `ep0ch` It only happens when it's in a card? 
solution: 

issue: `ep0ch` I have a feeling that it has something to do with the fact that the modal has no width before being displayed to calculate the width of the indicator off of, and by the time the modal is clicked the init is already done 
solution: that makes sense. 

issue: I'm opening an issue on Github 
solution: `ep0ch`  /**     * Handle window Resize */ _handleWindowResize() { this._setTabsAndTabWidth();  if (this.tabWidth !== 0 && this.tabsWidth !== 0) { this._indicator.style.left = this._calcLeftPos(this.$activeTabLink) + 'px'; this._indicator.style.right = this._calcRightPos(this.$activeTabLink) + 'px';      }    }  /**     * Handle tab click     * @param {Event} e */ _handleTabClick(e) { let tab = $(e.target).closest('li.tab'); let tabLink = $(e.target).closest('a');  // Handle click on tab link only if (!tabLink.length || !tabLink.parent().hasClass('tab')) { return;      }  if (tab.hasClass('disabled')) { e.preventDefault(); return;      }. `ep0ch` Alright, if it helps look into line 107+ here: https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/v1-dev/js/tabs.js. 

issue: thank you as well :D I'm eager to see if they find a solution to this 
solution: 

issue: `ep0ch` Yeah no problem man and me too, it's been an issue for a while since I had the same problem over a year ago and it still hasn't been addressed, I guess I probably should have opened an issue for it, I never really thought about it lol 
solution: 

issue: I can't get the datepicker working at all using the javascript initialization Will using a combination of jquery and JS mess it up? 
solution:

issue: trying to replicate your code in that codepen 
solution: 

issue: yeah I don't understand that, I'm linking to the same location I just threw your JS initialization code there in a pair of <script> tags after the other two scripts at the end - is that correct? I just don't understand how .pickadate could work on the codepen and not on my page here with all the links and code the same makes no sense really appreciate your help here I'm close to just using pickadate.js for this - it will be clunky, but it will work eh just really like Materialize

issue: @champolot why wouldn't it? it's a container with a section BELOW it 
solution: i tried to remove it. and there's no difference. 

issue: i tried to remove because you said it? what i understand what you've said is that. its not working because there's a container with a section below it. so i tried to remove the container

issue: Hi, there is angular2-materialize module (https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular2-materialize), however, it only works for materialize-css v 0.100.x. Making it work with version 1.0.0.rcx is a bit tricky 
solution: 

issue: Hi, based on [this SO Q&A](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51355020/materialize-css-sidenav-options-not-defined/51355079#51355079), consider adding `var options = {}` to the JS code block. Cheers. 
solution: 

issue: @koushik501s  fingers crossed! However, you can still use it. Just that you need a bit of more work. Pure css components will work out of the box. For some components I am using the angular2-materialize approach to get materializecss avaialble to angular and then use the  *ngAfterViewInit* method in my component to call the required *init* methods of the materializecss elements (using @ViewChild to get the DOM element handles).

solution: 

issue: why my dropdown won't came out? i even do all of it the same as the documentary in the website. is it the matters on the JS?? 
solution: 

issue: no, i don't think i use any <select>. 
solution: 

issue: Yes! load your modal like this:     $('.modal').modal({ dismissible: false}); @djromasanta @Levinstark can you send your code in a codepen? 
solution: 

issue: i'm totally give up, the documentary that i found all of them are different. the documentary from the website using $(".dropdown-trigger").dropdown(); to enable the dropdown, meanwhile the others use $(".dropdown-button").dropdown(); and they able to do that 
solution: 

issue: i've think about it, and when i check the materialize.min.css, i found out that there is no 'dropdown-trigger' element 
solution: 

issue: nope, i double checked it everytime and there is no error ok, i'll try it first yes i did i never missed to included materialize.min.js and materialize.min.css 
solution: 

issue: Hi Where is the error? 
solution: 

issue: try to comment out any styling you have added to the dropdown and its parent (.container_sub) no css at all, in order to check what is going on i assume you have included the materialize.min.js script ? also take off the 'row' class you don't need it there 
solution: 

issue: done remove the 'row' class finished comment out the element on dropdown and container_sub still not working is it possible that javascript colliding with each other to be the problem? 
solution: you would have an error if that was the case. 

issue: i can't figure out whats wrong

issue: does anyone know how to make the sticky footer work? 
solution: @nh916 have you tried to set the position into fixed?. usually i used that to make my footer stay sticky. 

issue: ok i just opened a new document and checked it i used a header, main and footer with the css givin and it worked but when i do the same with my document it doesnt work. could it be the js is getting in the way? 
solution: there shouldn't be any problem with the js. after i check the documentation, the footer code in the documentation and mine kind of different. 

issue: the one that i used was something like this```footer.page-footer {  margin: 0;  bottom: 0;  position: fixed;  height: 50px;  width: 100%;}``` 
solution: 

issue: im not sure honestly 
solution: 

issue: @AlleWielstra thanks for the help! now it's came out just like what you did so apparently i can't use the same id name for PC and mobile dropdown? 
solution: 

issue: as for your footer```footer.page-footer {position: fixed;bottom:0;left:0;width:100%;}```@Levinstark @Levinstark I think that's the case Please ask! @Atkn Great! Yes I do 
solution: 

issue: Have an issue I've been wrangling with today. We recently updated to the latest version of materializecss, we hadn't updated since perhaps october or so last year. The main issue we've had, is replacing the caret in the select dropdown. Previously it was a span with class caret that we could manipulate through CSS. Now though it's an SVG, which we can't manipulate the same way. As we use it through react, manipulating it after the DOM is rendered doesn't result in the best experience. Is there a more obvious way? 
solution: 

issue: @kp-clash If you still can't find that mail it to materializeframework@gmail.com 
solution: 

issue: So I just went through the css, I think the way it happens if by setting the bottom border to a thicker line and changing its color. What you could try is to use `.tab a.active` to target the active tab and change the settings there, however I am not sure if this works... 
solution: I've played with that a bit. it places the arrow i've created after the text within the tab. it does move as you would expect, but the positioning is off. 

issue: @DJN1 https://jsfiddle.net/z7v8cnh2/4/ This version hides the tab indicator and has the arrow on the .tab a.active class. i was thinking about instead using the properties i've written on the indicator class, since it animates nicely, but i can't get the position correct their, either 
solution: 

issue: @DJN1 `select {display:none}` this is how it's in default so when I have```    <select id="dropdown" for="dropdown">    <option value>Select an option</option>    <option value="student">Student</option>    <option value="Full Time Job">Full Time Job</option>    <option value="Full Time Learner">Full Time Learner</option>    <option value="Prefer not to say">Prefer not to say</option>    <option value="Other">Other</Option>    </select>```it doesnt show @ all 
solution: 

issue: I dont know. Sorry! @diomed 
solution: 

issue: yeah, ok. I get that. I just dont get why by default ~~your~~ this css framework hides html from page. that's kinda illogical to me * are those sea streams? @newmoon this is powered by JS right? 
solution: 

issue: did it work @rpm23 wait nvm

solution: 

issue: Hi everyone, if i want to change my dropdown from pop out by mouse click, into mouse hover. on which classes should i change the display tag? i suspect that i only need to change the display tag from none into block. but i can't find the exact classes from all of it, as i didn't found the correct one yet 
solution: 

issue: [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/WBFg/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/WBFg/image.png) does any one here have an idea how can be done in materialize? 
solution: i was thinking it was all done using div's. 

issue: hi there can anyone help me to sort out one of my materialize css issue?  the issue is I want auto swipable tabs and the active tab should be in center and when i chnage the tab the next tab automecally will be in center

solution: 

issue: But check the issue #5513 , I guess we can't import something like M from npm module of materialize-css or I don't know how to define the `M` from materialize module in .js file. Man, using react-materialize will be better for react but it got less features in comparison to materialize css haha 
solution: 

issue: I am actually having a similar problem. I am building an app in electron and I can only get materialize to work when I link to the cdnjs in my html. If I link to the local npm package materialize is not applied to the styling. I don't know why this is I got it to work by including both the normal and the minified versions 
solution: 

issue: ahh i see, i did look up for it a while ago, and it says it was a javascript framework. is there any cons of using it? i did think that it would work great for materialize as JS framework. 
solution: 

issue: Is it possible for datepicker / timepicker to work in modal window? (Last version of materialize)... I was using this feature in version 0.100.2 but in the last version the datepicker shows up behind modal window so I can't see it nor use it :/ 
solution:

issue: @Levinstark  This   https://materializecss.com/carousel.html    I've tried a lot, but on mobile, swipe don't work, nor the passage through the links inside the carousel. Everything is OK on the PC 
solution: 

issue: ```    $('.datepicker').datepicker('container','root');```@MaximBalaganskiy I tried to change the container settings like this but it actually hid the datepicker window 
solution: 

issue: This is weird XD, all the methods are working with `.init` XD but why not with `getInstance()` 
solution: 

issue: @GermaVinsmoke Any errors in your console? I haven't played around with it much, but when I use `getInstance()` I get an error: `Cannot read property 'jquery' of undefined`. Maybe still some work to do to remove all jQuery dependencies. 
solution: Yeah @newmoon same error, well because the value we're getting from `M.Datepicker.getInstance(elems)` is undefined that's why it says can't read the property of undefined..

solution: 

issue: I am using tabs in a card and I have followed exactly what the documentation on the site says but it does not seem to work, I almost feel like there is missing jQuery, the tabs are anchored to a list of divs, but all the data in the divs display and when you click on the tabs nothing happens, any ideas or suggestions to try? Yeah, one second 
solution: 

issue: No problem - you can use jQuery still if you prefer and go with the approach @AurelienTisserand recommends. Keep in mind, however, that document.ready is obsolete now. Best to do something like:```js$(materializeInit);function materializeInit() {   $(".tabs").tabs();   // initialize other materialize JS features below if needed}``` No problem @AurelienTisserand thank you too! :) @beartato327 It is deprecated as of jQuery 3.0: https://api.jquery.com/ready/> - $( handler )- $( document ).ready( handler )- $( "document" ).ready( handler )- $( "img" ).ready( handler )- $().ready( handler )>As of jQuery 3.0, only the first syntax is recommended; the other syntaxes still work but are deprecated. 
solution: 

issue: interesting, because I knew that you had to initialize tabs but I tried both the jquery and js approach and the jsfiddle does not work. Maybe thats just jsfiddle though. 
solution: Are you including all the css/js CDN?. I just added it to your fiddle, but no worries. I dont actually need it, I was just trying to learn how and why. 

issue: Yeah, here is my working jsFid http://jsfiddle.net/zkeypoxt/4/ 
solution: 

issue: interesting that it doesn't work when initialized in a script tag at the bottom of the html at least it didnt work for me 
solution: 

issue: @DJN1 Codepen adds all the external JS libraries from the settings to the end of your HTML, before the closing </body> tag. So, it's adding jQuery after your <script> [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/48Vz/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/48Vz/image.png)

solution: 

issue: Hello, would somebody be able to tell me how I can make my a link on my materialize website preview a document that is displayed on my desktop? 
solution: 

issue: Probably a stupid question but can anyone tell me how to get materialize dropdowns to work, ive tried adding $(".dropdown-trigger").dropdown(); in materialize.css and the main.js file i have linked but they just dont seem to want to work :/ will get a codepen now nevermind, my internet's being weird. can't seem to make one 
solution: 

issue: jQuery would probably be quicker for when I publish it jQuery CDN* Alrighty 
solution: 

issue: Then if you are having a standalone JS file for you html page put that below MaterializeCSS JS file and do <script src="your .js here"</script> and then you can copy the jQuery from my pen to your local js and it should work

solution: 

issue:  Hi, I have a problem when putting a datepicker inside a SwipeableTabs. This does not occupy the whole screen and it looks very bad. can you help me? 
solution: 

issue: I figured it out, the site uses a CDN for the font-awesome and I was using the given font-awesome.css and it must be out of date 
solution: 

issue: also I'd like to ask about one more problem I have with Materialize 1.0.0-rc.2... I can't get my sidenav dropdown working. I literally copy-paste the example from docs and it's not working, it shows only first level, but not the second one (dropdown) of sidenav. 
solution: 

issue: Sorry about the multi select, i follow the instruction and also initialize and it does not work

issue: Hi there I am trying to change the placeholder font-color of the chip input field that is being generated out of a div container. Unfortunately I cannot get ahold of it with CSS.Also tried inserting a label to get the standard behaviour but due to the input field being generated it does not function either. :(does anyone have a clue for me? :) 
solution: 

issue: hi im making one right now and while I copied everything from the docs I just found the little part:  <!-- Customizable input  --> <div class="chips">    <input class="custom-class">  </div> in the markup demo  will try that one first if it doesn't work I will send the pen :) 
solution: 

issue: ok so I tried to mash together the 2 versions (red color just as example)https://codepen.io/anon/pen/MBBzPyThe first attempt does not color the placeholder in any way2nd Attempt with the custom input field should give me a working label but doesn't properly. so my only other option right now would be to use the custom input field with a placeholder wich also does not work :( 
solution: 

issue: @GabrielFiel -_-° My bad... thank you... 
solution: @AurelienTisserand np :). 

issue: my page looks like this 
solution: 

issue: yes, right. sorry that I did explained it before 
solution: 

issue: @GabrielFiel inside the loop would be my "fallback". I just though it is maybe possible without it.I think I'll do it with the loop, because I must do even more stuff on the application. But thanks for the help anyway 
solution: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ZjMpNx?editors=1011. If you set up a callback on dropdown close, it will pass the trigger to that callback. 

issue: @newmoon that's looks like what I would have. Thanks a lot. I'll try it tomorrow 
solution: I won't lie, that was fun to figure out :) I updated the pen to get the value selected too.. 

issue: Ah end now I seem to understand the "onCloseEnd" a little bit more. For me javascript is always somehow magic. I'm more in the backend development.But nice, that you also had some fun.

issue: Hi everyone, i want to ask does z-index can make your dropdown content in the navbar in overlap with the main content so i got a navbar here where it also has a dropdown menu, the problem is, everytime i activate the overflow: hidden, it would hide the dropdown menu behind the main content is there any possible way, to make the dropdown visible above the main content, without turning off the overlay: hidden?

solution: 

issue: @newmoon I am getting an error in ie11 when i compile selective js files the error is Invalid operand to 'in': Object expected Can you please help me out 
solution: 

issue: @knlgpt I don't use IE11 or have access to it. You may want to ask here since it looks like the error is in anime.min.js https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime/issues @CervantesHuerta Looks like they programmatically add the opacity as an inline style. The opacity is faded in, so it's a little challenging to override with JavaScript. An easy way to get around it could be: ```css.sidenav-overlay {  background-color: transparent;}```That way, the opacity can be 0 or 1 and it won't matter because the background color is transparent.  
solution: 

issue: @newmoon i just found the problem with the carousel apparently i'm using the different version i thought all this time i'm using the 1.0.0-rc.2 version one found out i was using the v0.100.2 version

issue: i have a issue with date picker <input type="date" class="datepicker">  and  for javascipt   $(document).ready(function(){    $('.datepicker').datepicker();  }); its not working do i need to something else anyone can help? 
solution: 

issue: @newmoon I actually meant the script you sent me. I put it at the end of body and it works (thanks again) but am not sure if it's necessary or not or why exactly it is. If you could explain that, much appreciated! Also, is there a way to set custom colors (not in the color pallets provided by Materialize)? 
solution: 

issue: Hello. I need your help to identify the issue o my concernI encountered this for about 20days ago and posted a question on stackoverflow but not received any feedbacks. Hope you could answerhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/51435696/detect-close-event-of-side-nav-on-materializecss @MaximBalaganskiy Are you sure this is the correct fiddle your pertaining to ? http://jsfiddle.net/u2nzovd6/45/ this is the once you sent and I don't see any alert code

solution: 

issue: @MaximBalaganskiy  your latest fiddle didn't answer my concern, it even removed my original side nav 
solution: @thisisasample001 doesn'. doesn't it display an alert whan a sidenav is closed?. 

issue: I'm sure you can tweak it to your needs, since classes changed quite a bit in v1 I left it as an exercise @thisisasample001 this is because default behaviour changed you need to mark your items with a class to let them close the side nav [2018-08-10_16-28-23.mp4](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/8QgV/2018-08-10_16-28-23.mp4) 
solution: 

issue: @newmoon No worries. I think I meant in the template for Materialize.css, provided in the documentation, it says that the script to add the Javascript should be at the end of the body. I wasn't sure if I should do that with all other  scripts as well. Also, I tried adding M.AutoInit() in a script tag and removed my other initialization scripts, but it does not seem to work. Thank you so much, it worked!

solution: 

issue: Note: my screenshot is wrong, i have replaced getInstance(elem, options)  by init(elem, options) but it doesn't work neither 
solution: 

issue: Hey, so I'm making a project with Materialize. I was wondering, since I downloaded materialize, the stylesheet, the js, do i still need to initialize the elements? and assuming that this is a professional project situation (it's not),  what's the best way to store the initialize code? 
solution: 

issue: Yeah i copied the code for the button exactly from that page Is there a way to override the hiding Dont seem to work for me 
solution: 

issue: @UncleBen69 this works for me fine:```<a href="#" data-target="slide-out" class="sidenav-trigger"><i class="material-icons large">arrow_right</i></a>``` 
solution: 

issue: make sure you initiated the jQuery if you are not sure, just open the F12 and check the right top corner for red circle (that means there is an error on page) 
solution: 

issue: if that doesnt work try setting display to inline in css 
solution: 

issue: @Metajake can you share with us your initialization and the error you have? 
solution: also check for paddings and margins.

issue: I am not using VS for websites honestly... it just takes a lot of Ram and also if you have HDD like I do it's super slow while building a test so I am using Atom 
solution: 

issue: i have started to convert it here: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/zLbeyw do with it whatever... use it or dont @Arrow007 
solution: Wow, you didn't have to, thank you v much @DJN1. 

issue: @Arrow007 Your dropdown content will need to be in a separate container to work inside a full screen slider. For example, outside of your .slider <div>:```html<div id="dropdownContainer">  <ul id="dropdown1" class="dropdown-content">    <li><a href="#!">General</a></li>    <li class="divider"></li>    <li><a href="#!">Laboratory</a></li>    <li><a href="#!">Sediment</a></li>  </ul></div>```And in your initialize code, you then specify the bounding container:```jsdocument.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {  M.Slider.init(document.querySelectorAll(".slider"));  M.Dropdown.init(document.querySelectorAll(".dropdown-trigger"), {    container: document.getElementById("dropdownContainer") // bounding container  });});``` Example: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/OwqqZM?editors=1010 
solution: 

issue: really? i don't think i set the container with a certain height though because the image itself didn't have quite a tall height not yet and did you able to set the carousel height? because as far as i know, you can't set the carousel height it's 500px no i don't have it, but i have ultraviewer i can't use teamviewer because i got blocked or how about this i paste my codepen here maybe you can see what's wrong with the code 
solution: 

issue: when you open it on other device like laptop or macbook, there is small whitespace appearing between the image and the footer while when you open it on PC, there is no whitespace 
solution: 

issue: the color that appear there ... is what will tell u if it is a margin or padding 
solution: as i said. there is nothing in there. no margin or padding. 

issue: @bcraftmath Put the dropdown content inside a separate container, outside of the navbar and sidenav code, and then use the `container` option in your initialization code to specify the new container. ```html<div id="dropdownContainer">  <ul id="navDropdown" class="dropdown-content">    <li><a class="nav-link" data-target="#one">one</a></li>    <li><a class="nav-link" data-target="#two">two</a></li>    <li><a class="nav-link" data-target="#three">three</a></li>  </ul></div>``` ```js  // initialize dropdown menus  const dropdownMenus = document.querySelectorAll(".dropdown-trigger");  M.Dropdown.init(dropdownMenus, {container: dropdownContainer});``` Example: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/BPEXrZ?editors=0010 
solution: 

issue: @newmoon ok, i just check it, and the full screen one probably the good one if i used this, would it follow the screen size and not left any whitespace below? by the way i see there is note on the media slider, "Note: This is also Hammer.js compatible! Try swiping with your finger to scroll through the slider." does this mean i need to include hammer.js to make it slideable by finger when it one phone? 
solution: 

issue: even```select {      width: 10px !important;  }``` does not work

issue: Hello I'm Dominic. So I'm kinda new to materialize and I'm using it to build my personal site. Everything works fine except that when I submit data using ajax from my form, the date picker footer buttons get messed up after the form is reset. I've reviewed my code and I can't seem to figure out the problem. Stack overflow wasn't helpful either. Here's a link to my site https://evening-inlet-83542.herokuapp.com .

issue: > Hey, does any one fix the issue related to the drop-down hiding in overflow container. 
solution: 

issue: @qpajrathod09 Can you link to the issue you are referring to, or share code that shows the issue? It seems you can use the container option for your dropdown to fix it, but not sure without seeing your code. Maybe related to: https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/5303```js  M.Dropdown.init(document.querySelectorAll(".dropdown-trigger"), {    container: document.body  });``` @GermaVinsmoke It appears you forgot to include jQuery and Materialize.js in your code. Both of these need to go before your dropdown initialization:```html<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0-rc.2/js/materialize.min.js"></script>```Also, with multiple dropdowns referring to the same list, it will help to use a container as shown above in Vanilla JS, or with jQuery below:```js    $(".dropdown-trigger").dropdown({      container: document.body    });``` 
solution: 

issue: Hi @all i am new to materialize 
solution: 

issue: @imvv I'm guessing it's because much of materialize's CSS uses rem and em units. For example:```css.col .row {  margin-left: -0.75rem;  margin-right: -0.75rem;}```

issue: @drothroc You can specify a different container to house the <ul> / <li> elements that get generated with the dropdownOptions option:```js  M.FormSelect.init(document.querySelectorAll('select'), {    dropdownOptions: {      container: document.getElementById("dropdownContainer")    }  });``` Example: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ZMjKNK?editors=1010 
solution: 

issue: @akolloyd For the non-jQuery approach:```jsdocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {  // initialize all Materialize JS components with M.AutoInit()    M.AutoInit();    /*   Or, initialize just the sidenav and tabs with the code below:    M.Sidenav.init(document.querySelectorAll('.sidenav'));  M.Tabs.init(document.querySelectorAll('.tabs'));  */  });``` You'll also want to comment out this line of code, since it causes an error due to no H1 tags in your document:```jsdocument.getElementsByTagName("h1")[0].style.fontSize = "80px";```

solution: 

issue: Hi im carlo and im beginner 
solution: 

issue: Hi all, sorry for disturbing but I have an issue with the latest version and the `FormSelect` component `instance.getSelectedValues();` is only returning the previous value on attached `onchange` event but not the current selected value... is there a way to fix that? or does anyone got the same issue? also why there is no `change` event added / handled in the latest version? 
solution: 

issue: ok I fixed it on my side by writing a function that take the given instance as argument and run the patched code that should be used for `getSelectedValues()` ```javascript var t = []; for (var e in instance._valueDict)  if (instance._valueDict[e].el.selected)   t.push(instance._valueDict[e].el.value); return t``` this put this into the main code, just replace `instance` by `this`. Sorry for the spam but the rule for open an issue is to ask first here or stackoverflow.

issue: where to add options in jquery code for modals 
solution: 

issue: Hi ! I have a problem with Selects with content loaded with jquery's load() method.For example: https://wille.io/test.html <= This is the site to be loaded with load(), Select works.https://wille.io/test.index.html <= This site loads test.html into a container, but this breaks the Select.load() is quite useful because the loaded file has full access to the DOM and vise versa. Is this a bug or am *I* doing something wrong? 
solution: 

issue: @wille-io few issues:1. your select from index.html is inside the container you want to rewrite2. your test.html file should just contain the wanted html to load, not a complete page structure3. your code is not working at all otherwise you should get the design that wrap your select and you don'tyou should only init your Materialize instance after your jquery.load() call 
solution:

solution: 

issue: @Jiab77 Sorry that I can't return the favor. A pr would be the next step if nobody can help you here, I guess. @VK3FNG You can put whatever you want in it. Just remove the ```i``` element.```<a class="btn-floating btn-large waves-effect waves-light red">Long</a>```

issue: Hi guys, im having trouble locating documentation for M.Dropdown accessibility. Shouldn't tabbing onto the trigger open the dropdown and allow to tab through? Arrow keys work if the dropdown is open though... 
solution: 

issue: @glmars Yes, the same. Current workaround is to call .formSelect() before .getSelectedValues()

I want to display a list of dynamic data using React and I want to display 1 card per row on a small screen, 2 cards per row on medium screens, and 3 cards per row on large screens.

issue: Hi, I'm new to materialize and using it to build a PoC admin app. I've run into something I don't understand. I have set up a row with 12 s1 columns inside a container. If I push-s1 the last column it seems to create a 13th column. Is that expected behavior? I'm expecting it to wrap under the first column. If I offset-s1 the last column it wraps the element below the 2nd column, not the 1st. Is that expected behavior? I'm execting it to wrap under the 1st column.

solution: 

issue: @GabrielFiel  You could add extra padding to the .col or modify the grid itself if you're working with the source code for Materialize. @Brennii96 I'm using tabs on a site I'm working on right now, just checked, and am not getting that error. @pilarblancoraynal You should recreate your code using Codepen so people can better see.  Hard to fiddle with screenshots. 
solution: 

issue: Are they cols? If so materialize adds left and right padding inside each one:.row .col {    float: left;    box-sizing: border-box;    padding: 0 0.75rem;    min-height: 1px;}

If I click somewhat above, it will select the one below.

solution: 

issue: Hi. Been using materialize parallax framework to build something custom. I have minimal to no changes to Javascript, all materialize javascript compatibility works, modals, sidenav, parallax, etc. I cannot for the life of me get javascript/jquery to help me toggle things. I want to do something similar to 'collapsible' but I don't want to use the collapsible css, or 'ul' link lists. I looked for the simplest javascript or jquery snippets to simply SHOW with css a HIDDEN div. I just want to toggle visibility of a container on a button click but something in materialize is preventing me from doing that. I tried a dozen different snippets/methods of doing what I just mentioned but it only works outside of materialize and I cannot find the reason for any conflicts. Can anyone help me here? @copono do you have init.js in this theme? I can't remember why I had to add it in there myself once at the bottom, I then removed it and things still work for me so I cannot remember why I had to originally.

issue: Hey @DanielRuf I have a question for you. Any idea why I'm getting this weird effect on my sidenav when pages are loaded? I suspect it's because I'm currently overriding the built in styles. (I plan to change this.) On page loads the sidenav has momentary purple links and the width appears to animate. https://jay.holtslander.ca/ @jessmear Animate.css works well too. https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/ Just sharing a customization: Rotating carets in collapsibles: https://codepen.io/j_holtslander/pen/vMZGxM @Finabashi That's too vague to help.

issue: Hi all. Hoping someone can help with 'chips' / validation question. The basic functional pen: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/MRmNag I'm using jQuery to init chips and jquery validate for validation. if you click 'submit' the validation error kicks in as it should and goes away as you type. However, once you hit 'enter', the input resets back to invalid and triggers the error msg. How can I leverage jQuery to essentially check  if a chip exists on that particular element and only show the error if there are no chips. Trying to do this with stock jQuery and not the vanilla way in the docs with the M namespace. Any help's appreciated. 
solution: 

issue: right! i dont want that to happen 
solution: 

issue: So you can add validation using some js. Materialize has something similar Have a look at [this](https://materializecss.com/text-inputs.html)(please read it fully). It has form validation stuff like e Like error messages, input limti Limit etc. TL;DR, start reading it from the end, backwards  Also, does Materialize have First-Timers-Only or similar issues? I would like to solve one and contribute to materialize. Thanks

issue: Hi. I have problem with http://archives.materializecss.com/0.100.2/forms.html ...Pickers like callendar etc. are hiding automatic after releasing left mouse button on Chrome browser. This is happening for some days. Could anybody give me a clue how to fix it? On Materialize 1.0.0 everything is ok, but i'm using version 0.100.2 on my old web app. Or upgrading from version "0.100.2" to version "1.0.0" is my only option? This will probably cost me a lot of time, so i'm looking for an easiest way to fix my problem. 
solution: 

issue: Upgrading to 1.0.0 will be better as some other features will(can) also be buggy in 0.100.2. It won't take a lot of time. It will be worthwhile 
solution: 

issue: good day guys.  I am first time here and would like to ask if materialize have a built in alert message like bootstrap, which works for form? i am trying to check it but i dont fine in any documentation here. I only see something like cards which doesn't match  for form at all. thank you 
solution: 

issue: @HarshKhandeparkar ok, i will check it. Little bit confuse to embed since i use ejs so i have to try. THank you 
solution: 

issue: So this is the fonts being applied to elements in materialize css-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,"Segoe UI",Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,"Helvetica Neue",sans-serifand as i understand they are all system fonts being loaded from the system you are on, so I guess what I'm asking is do I need a licence for those fonts Thank you Daniel 
solution: 

issue: > so I guess what I'm asking is do I need a licence for those fontsas you already wrote, these are system fonts. No you do not need any license for these. If the browser does not find one locally he tries the next one until it finds the first matching font name.They are preinstalled on OS so they are out of your scope.

solution: 

issue: Hello. Quick question: Why materialize's javascript can't initialize dynamically created content even if its present on the DOM? I'm trying a workaround but, unless I append and initialize one by one (which is extremely inefficient) I can't do it. "Cannot set property 'tabIndex' of null" or "Cannot read property 'classList' of undefined" but they are there!I see it's a common problem, but I didn't find solutions... 
solution: 

issue: I don't get it, whats the difference between dynamically created elements and "legit" ones? Why the first can't be initialised and the latters can? Not even M.AutoInit() work 
solution: 

issue: Problem solved, it turned out it wasn't a problem of dynamically inserted javascript (even if I found out things like this, dunno why) but an error in the data-target of 1 dropdown that I didn't saw

issue: You have to initialize it first by using `M.Carousel.init(elem);` That will return the instance Do you use react? 
solution: 

issue: You have to go over each element using a foreach / for loop and initialize every single element. At least this makes more sense in general. 
solution: 

issue: I created the carousel before, but now I want to call next() in other function, so:```function editCarousel(_numVisible=5){ var elems = document.querySelectorAll('.carousel'); var options = {  fullWidth: false,  dist: 0,  shift: 0,  padding: 15,  numVisible: _numVisible, }; var instances = M.Carousel.init(elems, options);}function carouselLeft(){ var elem = document.querySelectorAll('.carousel'); var instance = M.Carousel.getInstance(elem); instance.next();}```

issue: datepicker not show click left and show click right ? what any problem same? 
solution: 

issue: I think this was directed at me @frontlinerhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/dEoVGG 
solution: 

issue: this has been bugging me for days on end, and I really can't seem to find a reason for the issue 
solution: 

issue: Well it's been about 3 years since I've looked into Materialize, as far as I can see it should work indeed. Did you make sure you aren't overwriting the viewport somewhere? You used the standard <viewport> tag wich should work, so. 
solution: 

issue: i'll check if there is somewhere i'm overwriting the viewport tag, but i doubt it. It's a 3 file project, not that many lines to cause trouble really 
solution: Hmm yeah that makes it unlikely.. i think it's likely it has something to do with the Google Apps script engine itself. maybe *it* overwrites the viewport, after all it does add the "this app was not created by Google" message....

issue: Hi, I am currently having trouble upgrading from 0.100.1 to 1.0.0. I have described my problem [in this question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/56077425/8374833). Did anyone encounter this problem before or has an idea where it comes from? 
solution: 

issue: I'm a noob, and am trying to utilize the datepicker only, however linking to the materialize css seems to apply the styling across my project (I'm building something using bootstrap). Is there a way to load only the css applicable to the date picker? I've tried going through the css file by trial and error, removing code, and I have had some success, but now a series of years and months appears at bottom of screen. Would very much appreciate any guidance. 
solution: 

issue: Many thanks, @kazik56 - much appreciated! PS: do you have any suggestions for targeting just the applicable code? I tried using just the code which references "datepicker", starting with the modal section at line 8632, and that got me most of the way there, however there remain significant issues. Specifically, after selecting a date, a series of years and months suddenly appears at bottom left of screen (not in the modal). 
solution: 

issue: I'm not that familliar with Materialize and neither with CSS. If I were you I would try copying everything with `date-picker` or however it is named 
solution: 

issue: OK - thanks anyway for pointing me to the ccs file! yes, that's just what I tried, and it helped somewhat - got me much closer, but for the issue with the months and years not being hidden post-selection. 
solution: 

issue: It's also in `dist` folder in their github At least give it a try, if it won't fix your problem then you will at least know that issue is located elsewhere 
solution: 

issue: thanks. will delve deeper into the js tomorrow - been coding for 17 hours and it's 4.31am here in Toronto...time for some sleep! thanks for your suggestions. 
solution: Definitely it's time to take a break.

solution: 

issue: @DanielRuf I can't find it, is that something I need to write myself? Also, I see the package.json file but nothing resembling a build script... Again, sorry for the basic questions, I'm new to web dev @DanielRuf, I see, thanks @LucasG021 let me know if you figure out how to do this. Still can't get int to work using the included grunt file. 
solution: 

issue: @bwong365 @raphaelreyna clone the repo and build your own, the node_module may not contain all files. You cam also install git repos with `npm install dogfalo/materialize` for example. 
solution: 

issue: @DanielRuf  yeah, but how do I actually build? I tried looking package.json but couldn't find anything resembling a build script.. 
solution: 

issue: They might have fixed it already though I am not sure Is your browser the latest version? Maybe try one of their daily builds Or the beta I think they have daily builds

issue: Colapsable has nothing to do with datepicker or timepicker. Are you sure your input field is resolving to textinput? That will really screw you on the desktop as the default picker will have a fight with the material one. Mobile uses materialize timepicker and desktop uses browser and desktop creating a js fight if input field is set to dateTime or time.  Must be set to charfield like it says in the docs. An hour is nothing  I spent a week.

issue: hello, good night, very thanks  @8749236  and @jyoost  for help, helped me a very [![Captura de Tela 2019-08-27 as 21.57.32.png](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/3XVO/thumb/Captura-de-Tela-2019-08-27-as-21.57.32.png)](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/3XVO/Captura-de-Tela-2019-08-27-as-21.57.32.png) it worked

issue: is anyone able to make the side nav work? im copying the code and putting it in and it doesnt work i have no idea whats going on

issue: @NickRyanWeber can you please tell us what you have tried? I would think a plain-old CSS class should work just fine.

issue: Hey, how do heck do i set the minDate on the new datepicker, apparently its not based on pickadate anymore? This used to work ( i need to adjust it based on other user selections ): picker.datepicker().set('maxDate', new Date(new Date().setFullYear(new Date().getFullYear() - minage))); 
solution: 

issue: I tried this, but doesn't help: M.Datepicker.getInstance(picker).options.minDate = new Date(new Date().setFullYear(new Date().getFullYear() - maxage)); Hmm, just checked the sourceCode and apparently if i run setDate() right after modifying the options, it works. However i would also like to hide the years that are disabled [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/V4t1/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/V4t1/image.png) 2013 is completely disabled, but still visible in the year list instance.options.maxYear = instance.options.maxDate.getFullYear(); 
solution: 

issue: i am looking for a CSS framework that works well with a lot of data, so it would need to be generally smaller in font size, padding, etc..  Is there a native way to shrink the Materialize component? 
solution: 

issue: The closest I can get is <p><label><input/><span></span></label></p>  this allows the checkboxes to show but they can't be clicked on. using WTForms which generates the html.  Don't know how to change how it orders the html this is what is being generated.        <label for="main">          <input id="main" name="main" type="checkbox" value="y">          <span>Primary Email</span>        </label> 
solution: 

issue: doing manual tests i can only get checkboxes to work when using the p > label > input > span >close label pattern  can't figure out how to get WTForms to reproduce that pattern 
solution: 

issue: @jeremyhawkins1 that is definitely your issue - if you do not use the EXACT structure from the docs then it won't work. The solution is to figure a way to get WT Forms to reproduce that pattern. Off the top of my head, it would be easy enough to manipulate the elements into the right order with jQuery , but it's a hack alright 
solution: 

issue: I just tried this in a live site and your code works fine. 
solution: 

issue: does the browser matter? this is the correct CDN to use? https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0/css/materialize.min.css" 
solution: 

issue: @jeremyhawkins1 I don't use CDN, I compile CSS from SASS so can't help there. Can you set an event listener on the checkboxes and console.log to check they are all being triggered? @tiffany-tychewicz the materialize docs aren't great tbh. I use Wordpress (of which jQuery is a dependency) so I just use the jQuery examples. My advice would be to load jQuery and make use of it, the vanilla code snippets in the docs aren't written very well. 
solution: 

issue: @pwcreative  I am missing something simple in the code i am sure.  I added this event listener to all of the checkboxes: $("input:checkbox").click(function(e) {      console.log(e);      console.log(e.target.id,"was clicked on");    });  only the bottom two that are able to be checked are responding.  the top two are acting like they aren't being clicked.  I checked the devtools and all 4 checkboxes have the event listener on them.  guessing something is eating the click event on the top two before it can bubble up to the checkbox input 
solution: 

issue: @pwcreative  the pages isn't publicly accessable but I copied the html into a gist and removed the personal information from it.  https://gist.github.com/jayrat/09e4bd337e7302308d19afefd7dee04b  ... I can't see where my mistake is.  I am going to be in meetings for the rest of the day.  appreciate any  hints you can find. I'll see if i can change it into a tab on the card.

issue: Hello everyone! I happy i found those resource as I have been struggling to get Materialize CSS form select to work properly. I've checked every related post on Stack Overflow for an answer. Here is my issue... I am using materialize with express-ejs and jquery. I got the select element to display correctly on my form but the selected values are not being passed when I submit the form. Tried using .val() and all other suggestions on the web. Seems like it should be straight forward to do this but I can't get it to work

solution: 

issue: @nimitbhargava it’s not a good idea to use classes like that in the long run, very hard to maintain and the reason why Materialize leaves them out. Just write css rules for components and globally and it will be easier to manage.

issue: @taimanh229 what have you got so far? 
solution: 

issue: I am trying to add MaterializeCSS to a site that automatically adds jquery and the jquery simple modal plugin. Unfortunately, both are initialized in the same way so sometimes when I load the page I get the materialize modal and other times I get the simple modal. I cannot remove jquery simple modal from the page and am loading materialize from the CDN. Has anyone else had this issue yet? 
solution: 

issue: There may be another way but in the absence of anyone else chipping in, that would be my solution. The cdn obviously loads the default js which includes modals. I’m guessing the Jquery modal you’re loading uses the same classnames as materialiZe? Because you have to init the materialiZe modal for it to work.

issue: Is there a way to resize a check box, they are a little too large for what I'm working on 
solution: 

issue: @drewhack yes, using css. But making them smaller is actually bad for UX - any click or tap areas are easier to use when they’re bigger. 
solution: Can you lead me in the right direction to do so, they're just slightly too large. I've tried adding a height and width to the checkbox field but it doesn't seem to matter. 

issue: Is there some sort of guideline to follow to do text translations correctly?, like for instance the "Please fill out this field" message and all similar?

issue: @appukuttan-shailesh I understand, with pre-existing content a workaround is essential. I've never tried to do this specifically but I'm up for trying :) @appukuttan-shailesh one really quick and dirty way to to get to almost where you want to be would be to use      instance.destroy();to unitialize the tabs. This stacks the content. The only issue is the tab titles still list separately up top. My solution to this would be to use classes to hide the tab titles when the plugin is destroyed, and then have a hidden title above each tab content (inside the tab) that is made visible when the instance is destroyed. I'm not certain on your use case though, you may need something more robust. @jayantamadhav Sorry, I don't understand what you mean. One thing for sure, the materialize grid is 100% responsive, if you're having issues then it is probably an error in your code. Please send a link or build codepen with your issue, and always use the code samples from documentation to get working examples.

issue: @chun that isn’t the code from the documentation. My advice would be to use the code from the documentation and then get to grips with how it all works. If I get the chance I’ll try your code in a codepen but I can see that the structure is not the same as the docs just by looking at it. 
solution: always use CLEAN DOC EXAMPLES and work toward the desired outcome!. @dsharma1998 I haven’t used m with React yet, so can’t help, sorry..

issue: materialize select input field.  Oddly it suddenly started working. I have no idea why. I have nothing starting on document.ready now and it says i need $('select').formSelect(); to run for it to do this. So confused. 
solution: 

issue: @edwardcolley So you are sorted now? Note I use:     $(document).ready(function(){           $('select').not('.disabled').formSelect();      }); 
solution: 

issue: @pwcreative sorry for getting back so late. It did get sorted, but I still don't really understand why or the framework when it uses JS. For instance I can't get a modal working correctly when following the instructions and everything is linked correctly, which is fine (I'm not using a modal for this project, just inputs).  But I like this framework and would like to understand what I'm missing... 
solution: 

issue: that makes sense. I will make sure I use that sequence. I am running into a sort of beginner issue now that I've inserted my feature into the project and I'm not sure if this is easily fixable. My head component isn't loading the materialize stylesheet despite the path being correct. It loads stylesheets right beside it fine. It loads the script file fine. It is loading quite a bit on the page. I've tried putting it at the beginning and the end of the links. I know this is pretty vague, but was hoping maybe there was a simple fix. Hey guys, I'm really not sure what to do. So I made a mock login modal on my own with materialize and everything worked fine. Now that I've inserted everything into our project, I cannot get materialize.js or min.js to load properly and nothing complex will render. Specifically materialize select inputs.  I've checked all the links. The css loads fine.  I've tried loading the js from the bottom of the header component, the middle. the bottom of my modal component. top. etc.  I've used  $(document).ready(function() {            $('select').not('.disabled').formSelect();       and Ive tried            $('select').formSelect();it keeps telling me .fromSelect() is not a function.  I'm pulling my hair out. okay it says in sources in the console that the js file is being loaded so i still can't figure out why formSelect() isn't a function then even more now 
solution: 

issue: @IsmailYaman devs on vacation @alideet nope, materialize is a CSS framework, not a WP theme @betheman you must call an updater for the select to show the data...

issue: Hi there, I am using materialize css to make a extension. On firefox it works well, but on Chrome the popup page's response is very slow.

solution: 

issue: input field for materialize chips is not working. Need help ASAP 
solution: 

issue: yeah it's all structured that way. I get rid of the .formSelect error by switching to the vanilla JS version, but nothing is being rendered when calling for a multiselect... i'll see if I can make something simple to show as an example, but it uses multiple components okay this doesn't have all the styling, but it gives you an idea of the structure https://codepen.io/edwardcolley/pen/oNgyMNY

issue: hii i am trying append the response from ajax to the select option but i am unable to append it can someone help me on this pleasw 
solution: 

issue: unfortunately a lot. on the ones where I only have a few I did hardcode them in. The height resizing was weird. It was targeting the outermost container divs of all inputs on the page (not just the ones clicked) and resizing them by about 32px regardless of how many inputs were in that container.  Giving the divs their own height got rid of that.

solution: 

issue: I think maybe you're not using the components correctly. Tabs are buttons to show/hide content. You're using a dropdown inside a tab - not part of the docs and not really how they should be used. The dropdown content is being restricted to the height of the tab, as tabs have their own css and behaviour. Have you got areal world example you're trying to replicate? Also your tabs weren't initialized either, though thats not really the problem. 
solution: 

issue: Imagine i want to use only one modal component of this framework in my react app.. will React remove the remaining unused components in final production build? Or my production App gonna carry all components of this framework ? even i have not used them? So it will make my app bulky.

issue: [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/U0LK/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/U0LK/image.png) 
solution: 

issue: @wtfdhaval lastly, if your component needs initialising (not all of them do, so check the docs), make sure you initailize it in your custom js (myscript.js), and if you're using vanilla JS, take out the options variable unless you are actually setting any options:          document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {      var elems = document.querySelectorAll('.dropdown-trigger');      var instances = M.Dropdown.init(elems, options); <!-- <<<<< TAKE options OUT!!!!!! -->    });      // Or with jQuery      $('.dropdown-trigger').dropdown(); 
solution: 

issue: @wtfdhaval lots of ways. materialize doesn't do anything special to images. If you want any elements next to each other they need to have display inline, or float left, or just use columns and put the images inside. 
solution: That doesn't use materialize markup. I suggest you start here:https://materializecss.com/grid.html.

issue: Hi Guys, I have found a bug with dropdowns in ios / mobile safari. Is there someone who I can contact directly about it? I was able to reproduce it on multiple devices. Sure thing, thank you for replying. The browser-default thing seems like a solution for select dropdowns but doesn't fix the "menu" drop-down things. Is there a workaround for that already? If I understand correctly this fixes selects, but not other dropdowns, right? 
solution: 

issue: @webffo it's a known issue with temporary fixes already in place. One sec... https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/6464 
solution: 

issue: @webffo browser-default is not the fix, serving the patched js file after materialize.js is the fix. If this doesn't work for you, have a dig around in the issues, there may be something. 
solution: Also do you have any idea what could cause that? I have tried to remove animations and scale() to see if that solves it but it didn't change much iirc.. https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/blob/v1-dev/js/select.js. 

issue: Sorry.. I have disabled the select dropdowns on my projects completely and will look to rebuild the dropdown menus too. However I would assume that there must be a reason why this is not working properly and I will try to systematically go over all the css and Js until it works. It is much easier to build a workaround or fix if the code causing the bug is known. 
solution: 

issue: @webffo that's a noble project :)I think you may find some clues as to what is causing the issue if you look through the various threads in issues - for both select and dropdown, it comes up a lot. Maybe looking at the fix to the select may help, as selects are basically dropdowns.

issue: @pwcreative I have just ran the basic "nvm install" @DanielRuf so that means to go Docker style, as I do not want to downgrade nvm on my machine @pwcreative maybe - can you prepare a Docker compose for the whole Materialize, that works?

issue: @mxdpeep I can't speak for your setup. But I created a clean folder and ran that command from terminal and it worked. 
solution: 

issue: Anyone here use wordpress? I've just been working on a theme that uses materialize. Based on html5blank. If anyone wants to try it out before I upload... 
solution: 

issue: @mxdpeep no, you can switch using nvm use / install 10. You have to run `npm init -y` and then `npm i ... --save` @mxdpeep the error mentions that. `@next` is an old tag, you don't neet it anymore @mxdpeep Also it seems you are in the wrong path (what does `pwd` show?) For Git use `npm i dogfalo/materialize` (uses ssh) or the GH url or run a normal `git clone git@github.com:dogfalo...`. 
solution: 

issue: @kimiadarden this is a very, very bad idea. Both frameworks share some (but not all) class names and you will run into conflicts. I had a similar unavoidable situation recently and it was pure hell to work with. Go with one or the other. If you must use both, whichever stylesheet is served last will take precedence, depending on specificity. But my advice would be to run away fast @Veronikets I can’t help you in spanish(?!)

issue: hi good afternnon I have a question according to this https://materializecss.com/dropdown.html dropdown how can a get the value in a variable in js the page does not explain that very clear 
solution: 

issue: Thanks for the answer, however, I created a code pen to show you https://codepen.io/gonzalza/pen/WNvrqxW?editors=1010 @doughballs thanks mate, I appreciate it, Im gonna try it 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs I'm definitely listening to the right one, because as soon as I add class "browser-default" to it, the change event triggers. I've also tried this: M.FormSelect.getInstance(elem).addEventListener("change", ...); but get error "EventListener is not a method".. 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs ...thanks,  I tried this below... setTimeout works, but not getting the trigger, what do you think im missing? if(window.location.hash) {      setTimeout(function(){       var hash = window.location.hash      $(hash).trigger('click', function() {      $(".collapsible-body").first()       .css("display", "block")       });         },1000);

solution: 

issue: Hey Samuel - I don’t think you need to init individually if you use autoinit(). Only one way to find out though! 
solution: 

issue: @Blixary your issue is duplicate dropdown triggers. You have two elements on the page that both haver the same data-target, when I removed one, it worked. Also when using codepen - you should use the settings tab at the top (> js and > css) for CDN scripts and the right hand js panel for any custom js ( such as M.AutoInit() )Updated codepen:https://codepen.io/doughballs/pen/BaNpQZBIf you're clever about it you can restructure your navbar to not use duplicate data-targets... Did you initialise the select input? https://materializecss.com/select.html#initialization Whatever component you use, you need to check the relevant page on the docs - if there is a section called initialization, then you need to add that line to run the component. Ah ok. Yeah I just tested, it works fine. However you're setting up your project, there's an error in there somewhere. Where are you running m.AutoInit() ? 
solution: 

issue: Do you also have an idea, why this isn't working? [![download.png](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/X4Xb/thumb/download.png)](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/X4Xb/download.png) [![download.png](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/BYjl/thumb/download.png)](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/BYjl/download.png) There is no Dropdown field. 
solution: 

issue: Yes, I already tried that, but it didn't work, too. Could you fork the codepen and test it yourself and send me? And thank you really much for your patience and your help!!! 
solution: 

issue: @RicardoEwertz I don't understand the issue. Is it just the icons that are not displaying? You are using CDN? You are connected to the internet? 
solution: If the icons are not displaying then the link to the icon stylesheet is broken. That should be a simple fix. Are you using CDN for materialicons?. 

issue: We ate using a Materilaize Theme for Opencart 3.0 . Not sure if the CDN is activated. 
solution: 

issue: So how are you connecting to material icons? They are not part of materializecss. They are an external resource. https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/ 
solution: 

issue: Any other suggestion to this topic.... Materialize Icons not shown when using a ngrok or local tunnel to access the localhost to view a website.... 
solution: 

issue: @treetrails sure. Many ways to do it, but you could import the google font into _variables.scss:         @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans&display=swap');Then on line 306 (Section 20. Typography)           $font-stack: 'Open Sans',  sans-serif !default;Something like that should work :) I don't change my font this way though , I do it in my custom sass file, just my personal preference. SO this is untested. 
solution: 

issue: Hi all. Can anyone help me out here. I'm trying to reset a file input field using jQuery and vanilla JS but have never managed to do it unless I remove materialize.js from the page.

issue: I know that the php part is working, because i debuged it all with. The only problem is, that the modal isn't opening again after submitting the form... Here is the whole file excluding the header etc.: https://hasteb.in/yitulosa.xml so? 
solution: 

issue: Greetings. Silly question, but I'm having trouble getting the following to work: .input-field input[type='text']:focus + label {  color: var(--hover-color);} It won't update to my variable for --hover-color. 
solution: 

issue: What does inspector tell you about that element? Is your colour being applied and then overridden? I don’t think + label is valid css selector? Could be wrong... @m1rose28 did you initialise the modal? Modal is one of the JS components that won’t work unless you run the initialisation for it - check the documentation for that page. 
solution: 

issue: No, I'm not seeing it get overridden. I'm actually not seeing the color showing up in Inspector at all. For clarification, my color variable I'm using (--hover-color) is not being overridden according to Inspector, but the default green Materialize comes with isn't showing up in Inspector at all (but is still being applied). No I haven't learned sass yet. Almost all my work is in CSS. Some use the flat Bootstrap CDN with minor changes. 
solution: 

issue: document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {    var elems = document.querySelectorAll('.modal1');    var options;    var instances = M.Modal.init(elems, options);  }); < this did, work... removing options too didn't 
solution: 

issue: @wolffle for the input the default is:      input:not([type]):focus:not([readonly])  {         border-bottom: 1px solid #26a69a;         -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 0 0 #26a69a;         box-shadow: 0 1px 0 0 #26a69a;       } 
solution: and the label:     input[type=text]:not(.browser-default):focus:not([readonly])+label {         color: #26a69a;     }. @m1rose28 https://codepen.io/doughballs/pen/qBdmRqM.

issue: Hello, could someone please check my codepen and let me know where I am going wrong with M.FormSelect.getinstance()? I can't seem to grab it with either the DOM object or the query selector. https://codepen.io/astarrh/pen/qBdPbJv?editors=1111 I am using $(this) inside an .each() loop. 
solution: 

issue: When I use materialize i prefer using vanillaJS to initialize so sometimes I end up not linking jQuery...is it a requirement in materialize even if I will use pure JS only 
solution: 

issue: @daniele-russo I think the problem is you have duplicate data-target on the .dropdown-trigger. You would need to have unique data-targets, and I guess you'd need to duplicate the dropdown content.

issue: Hi, I faced an issue with where an simple <select> group will not work in safari on iphone. Any ideas what to look for?https://pastebin.com/D8h6qWKh 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs  Unfortunately, it's doesn't work for me. I found some solutions on github and stackoverflow. Thanks :) 
solution: 

issue: @michael0812 what didn’t work? I didn’t give you the link...! 
solution: 

issue: @rodovelazquez-utn this is an interesting one, I'm not sure what the correct way to do it is, but here is a way:https://codepen.io/doughballs/pen/zYGpGZJSo we basically trigger clicks on both the input and the relevant li in the dropdown, remembering that we're dealing with materialize appended elements, I've put an ID on the parent container so we can target whatever is inside it. 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I know it is because I still don't completely understand React but in the Materialize-react documentation I dont quite understand how to apply individual ID's to each item in a carousel due to the images array being the only input. Again I feel like there's something I'm missing, anyone willing to explain? 
solution: 

issue: I'm switching from bootstrap to materialize to improve my skills ;)

issue: [![afbeelding.png](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/k6oB/thumb/afbeelding.png)](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/k6oB/afbeelding.png) hi, im currently getting this weird error when clicking an select. i'm using the v1-dev branch 
solution: 

issue: @Catman155 dunno mate, I don’t use it that way so never come across this error. Can you not just download it, or do you need to install it via grunt? 
solution: 

issue: yeah i had those problems with wrong items being selected. sometimes the touch went through the selectbox on the button thats below it. So the sass version seems to work? I'll look into that 
solution: 

issue: @Catman155 no sorry, ignore my comments on sass. Look on materialize github for a closed issue titled iOS select broken, and see the patched select.js solution. Serve that after materialize.js and the select will work. I’ll detail more tomorrow if you can’t find it but off to bed now... 
solution: 

issue: [![Screenshot_2020-03-11 Screenshot.png](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/bKxh/thumb/Screenshot_2020-03-11-Screenshot.png)](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/bKxh/Screenshot_2020-03-11-Screenshot.png) @doughballs I tried with small, medium or large class but it did not help. 
solution: 

issue: I asked, because I hate Jquery and would like to avoid it is https://materializecss.com/ a heavy framework ? 
solution: 

issue: @jadenguitarman hey. I think there is some way ti strip out unused css, but I've never used it. You'll need to use Sass and Grunt to get a minimal build, but it won't be just the timepicker. Materialize is not fully componentised yet, so it will be like a bare minimum build. 
solution: 

issue: @softshipper Actually *Materialize* is using a smaller  jQuery alternative: [cash](https://github.com/kenwheeler/cash) @doughballs  What do you mean by> ..., and then grunt to create a trimmed down materialize.js, both with just the components that I'm using.?You concatenate simply the used <component>.js files with grunt? 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I am new here. Nice to meet you all. Can I ask a question regarding collapsible? Oh, I think I  just solved my problem. There is no need to ask for now. Thank you anyway 
solution: 

issue: @liranjp you can just download it and open the folder in VSCODE. 
solution: i tried to  do it like this --- > https://www.npmjs.com/package/materialize-angular. but once I do step 2 i get error :/. 

issue: Hi. Can't use 'data-content' with 'img' init in select-options. Not showing up. How can I modify it or how can I style data-icon. Thanks! 
solution: 

issue: Do materialize have any default alert messages ? e.g warning, info, alert like in bootstrap. One more question. Is there any way to trigger data-error or data-success (form input fields errors) messages on submit form in react ? 
solution: 

issue: @rabeent actually ignore me - I think it is a quick one liner!https://codepen.io/doughballs/pen/MWwGXYY      .row .col {           padding: 0 1.5rem;       } Try that...

issue: Hi, I'm working with the "filled-in" checkbox. I'm trying to change the border color to red with javascript, but I can't do it. I'm trying with "myCheckBox.style.borderColor = red;". Any suggestions? Thanks! 
solution: 

issue: @rodovelazquez-utn This is the style applied to filled in checkbox. Not sure you can do it with JS as it's a pseudo el?    [type="checkbox"].filled-in:checked+span:not(.lever):after {       top: 0;       width: 20px;        height: 20px;        border: 2px solid firebrick;        background-color: firebrick;        z-index: 0;      }https://codepen.io/doughballs/pen/xxxPaXm

issue: Guys, has anyone had any experience with Vue? I'm making some changes to a site that I didn't build, and I'm getting a flash of the mobile menu on desktop, before the site loads. It's coming from a conditional for sure (if-mobile), but I've never used Vue and not sure where to begin with debugging it.

issue: How do I get my carousel to cycle with vanilla js? 
solution: 

issue: @tuffant21 Once I put the .next() what should I do to make it loop and repeat ? try this var carousel = document.getElementById("carousel");var instancesTwo = M.Carousel.init(carousel, {fullWidth: true, indicators: true, duration: 200});instancesTwo.next(0,1,2,3); 
solution: 

issue: Hi. Anybody here tried to put a carousel slider on a modal and jump to the correct image on that modal slider? What would one need to do for that and what not. 
solution: 

issue: Off the wall question, can the navbar background color be transparent? I'm attempting to provide background-color settings to an rgba value. The sides of the navbar are transparent to the degree I set, but the contents portion are opaque. Must the background always be solid? It's not absolutely necessary, but I'm playing with the CSS to see what looks cool. 
solution: 

issue: Ok cool. Maybe I'm doing something wrong then. Here's my CSS:.nav-wrapper {  background-color: rgba(5, 89, 158, 0.7);}This should give the background a color of a navy blue with a 30% opacity Correct? Again, the edges outside of the container are receiving the 30% opacity correctly, but the navbar itself isn't Inspecting it in browser doesn't show any additional applications of color that are overriding the background-color setting 
solution: 

issue: the interesting thing is if I uncheck the background-color CSS override, the entire navbar area (opaque or transparent) returns to the default Materialize salmon color. !important does not seem to increase precedence. 
solution: 

issue: Huh. Removing nav-wrapper worked. I was under the impression materialize's nav class was nav-wrapper. Funny. In hindsight, I think my change looks ugly lol. Back to full opaque navbar! Thank you either way, @doughballs, hope you're staying safe amid the outbreak. That goes for the lot of you! Gotcha. Thanks @doughballs 
solution: 

issue: @wolffle just to clarify, we keep the nav-wraper element, but it's actually the nav element (native HTML) where the color is set:https://codepen.io/doughballs/pen/LYVBpjJ    nav {         background-color: transparent;     }

issue: Hello guys. I'm having problems with carousel and collapsible. I put my carousel inside collapsible and it is not behaving properly. Can anyone help me with this? Hello guys. Can someone help me in this? https://codepen.io/jhenryj09/pen/rNVrGza 
solution: 

issue: @jhenryj09 you are using 1.0.2 - please use 1.0.0 (unless you are using 1.0.2 for a specific reason?) State your version number if not using the current release.Second, you need to initialise both the collapsible and carousel.Third...I'm not sure a carousel inside a collapsible is a great idea, and you may need to play around with the css to get it to work properly. The issue with having nested components is that you will have to tackle style conflicts in some scenarios. 
solution: Fire away.... 

issue: I don't understand the  question. Meet in person? Or you're looking for someone to do work for you? 
solution: 

issue: @DevMartinese they are not made by the same team, but my guess is they both take inspiration from Google’s material design. @DevMartinese did you succeed?! I can’t get my head around JS frameworks. I’m too old school I think..!

solution: 

issue: Thanks  @doughballs . Yes that's the case. I think I don't understand the variables that are available from Materialize. It is very poorly documented. I just can't get the instance of the carousel object on the Modal. Anybody else?

When I try to use sidenav as it is said in official guide, I'm getting an error saying "TypeError: jquery__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_3___default(...)(...).sidenav is not a function". Tried googling it, every possible solution on SO/Github/reddit not working for me(older version of materialize/jquery etc.). Can someone help me? 
solution: 

issue: @annaighoinart Might be able to help, but we'll need a lot of info to solve it. Can you give us everything to try to reproduce it? @mulgey I will check that out soon Nice, wtg [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/DLew/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/DLew/image.png) Are you referring to that gap? 
solution: 

issue: > You have `<select multiple>`. You should change that to `<select>`I want to use multiple's CSS (it's cool) but disable multiple selection. That was why i was trying to turn it off with "isMultiple boolean" It's easy to remove multiple but that's not I'm aiming for 
solution: 

issue: @tuffant21 great solution, I have forked so I can use in my own projects :)You could refactor without using ES6 so that it is IE compatible...Another solution that allows for varying card heights is to use masonry.jsThe startup theme from Materialize uses it. But this doesn't give you the clean horizontal lines of a traditional grid, so it depends on the aesthetic required. 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs ... so I always test something with this: https://codepen.io/ZABarry/pen/vWdKOQ and I forgot some things dont work with the pre v1 script  ....my first reaction was to say "amazeballs" btw ....thanks

issue: Has anyone managed to set Select options in the init? As in, the actual <option></option>? Struggling to get it to work. 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs I already tried to rebuild a code from scratch using what is in materialize but it seems to me that the example is incomplete and did not achieve anything 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs  sorry, i belive that you dont understandme,i need what the tabs be Swipeable Tabs , 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs On that pen, I created two select instances.The first one selects the initial value in JS before initializing the select instance.The second select dynamically creates options and selects a value. If you hit the button under it, it removes the old options, creates new options and reinitializes the select. @srlokygood if you need swipable tabs, could you use a carousel? ohhhh Dropdown options points to dropdown because the select uses the drop down as well https://materializecss.com/dropdown.html That took me a while to piece together myself. It was really confusing Here's a codepenhttps://codepen.io/tuffant21/pen/MWwRgje 
solution: 

issue: @tuffant21 nope, initialising the component with the options for the select. the actual options thst make up any select, not the materialize customization options. @srlokygood well there's a typo on the carousel for starters ccarousel-slider is not correct. 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs I'm not sure I'm following. I didn't set any materialize options. I set the select options dynamically `for (var i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {    var option = document.createElement("option");    option.value = i;    option.innerHTML = i;    someOtherSelect.appendChild(option);  }` For real, that would make things easy haha

solution: 

issue: @AronWater it's pretty much a js initialization like the rest of them. In componentDidMount method you initialize a selector, M.Scrollspy.init(selector, {}); and you have it included. The biggest issue with scrollspy is that React has a very particular type of routing, which you should read about before using scrollspy Unless you mean actually the 'react-materialize' third part library, in which case I can't help you :( You're welcome :) @melchr have you tried with cards flexed in row and spaced evenly? 
solution: 

issue: I am trying to use the react-wrapper 'react-materialize' library, but I find that due to its nature(everything embedded in js), it is way too difficult for me to use CSS stylesheet to customize it. so I am planning to directly use the  original "materialize css" css library but since jquery doesn't play very well with React that's why I am looking a way to use it without using jquery [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/GmNp/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/GmNp/image.png) you mean I can use the    M.Scrollspy.init(selector, {})  in the  componentdidmount , i will try that out thanks!

solution: 

issue: @DhanushkumarSivaji I don't use react, but this article talks about splitting the JS components - you could maybe do the same with sass components. https://medium.com/@mattdlockyer/youre-using-materialize-css-wrong-470b593e78e9There would need to be a global sass(the minimum required)+component sass, and there would be a lot of wastage unfortunately, as Materialize was built before the world went loopy for JS frameworks. I think the devs are looking to componentize the framework but it's a huge job and not sure what the timescales are. @robbersite the best way is to use Sass...

solution: 

issue: Do materialize JS components that have init() methods support auto-generating the init options based off data- attributes on the source "element"?  I had noticed that some attributes like data-target get used on dropdown but it didn't seem like other data- attrs I had were being applied to the init options.  I can write my own JS shim to ensure but I wasn't sure if the intent was for all data- attrs to be applied and matched if the name matches or not.  Thanks! 
solution: 

issue: @sfhaney each to their own, and sometimes variations/options are good - but that element is exactly the kind of reason that I left BS for Materialize. Just kinda pointless to me. I like the materialize guys as I think they cut to the chase! @sfhaney you lost me with your last point...

solution: 

issue: and everytime you open https://thinginvent.com/invention/#???? Firebase searches for the id and then displays the data Oh damn, yes it is You work so hard on something and if just one feature is working you are very happy 
solution: 

issue: Ji @onaforeignshore it's hard for me to understand your use case. The currently active modal is easy to find - jQuery('.modal.open')[0];Plus each modal should have a unique ID, so it's easy to look inside each one and check the table. Those two functions run every time a modal opens and closes. They are just helper functions so you can run other code when the modal opens and closes. 
solution: 

issue: That's strange then because this:```const modalOpenEnd = () => {  const openModal = jQuery(".modal.open");  console.log(openModal);};```only reports to the console during initialisation and never again 
solution: 

issue: You can run separate inits for each modal if you like - for instance, instead of initialising all modals using .modal, you can initialise individual modals using the ID selector. Hang on. Let me put a quick pen together to demonstrate. https://codepen.io/doughballs/pen/abvJPww?editors=1111 
solution: 

issue: @onaforeignshore if you change`"onOpenStart":  function() { modalOpenStart(); },`to`"onOpenStart": modalOpenStart,`that might work too. Then you wouldn't need the wrapping function Without the parenthesis. That way it points to the function essentially

[![Screenshot 2020-05-01 at 15.04.34.png](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/T6Tx/thumb/Screenshot-2020-05-01-at-15.04.34.png)](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/T6Tx/Screenshot-2020-05-01-at-15.04.34.png) Hover the element, it tells you on the right the styles applied and where they come from. `.carousel` has it's own styles, 400px is declared, but I think the js pipes that value in as inline as well. Not sure why but I guess it was needed.

issue: Did anyone try to add a video inside the parallax-container.  parallax? I added one and it worked fine except the video didn't move relative to the white section. I don't know which part of code I should change for it. Yes, but I have some problem. ```css=.parallax-container {  position: relative;  overflow: hidden;  height: 400px; }  .parallax-container .parallax {    position: absolute;    top: 0;    left: 0;    right: 0;    bottom: 100;    z-index: -1; }    .parallax-container .parallax img {      opacity: 0.5;      position: absolute;      left: 50%;      bottom: 0;      min-width: 100%;      min-height: 100%;      transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);      transform: translateX(-50%); }      .parallax-container .parallax video {        opacity: 1;        object-fit: cover;        position: absolute;        left: 50%;        height: auto;        top: -70%;        min-width: 100%;        min-height: 100%;        /* transform: translate(-50%, -50%); */        transform: translate3d(-50%, 0, 0);        transform: translateX(-50%); }```The above is the css code I changed for videos

issue: Hello, I'm running into an issue when trying to display chips inside a table. If the table contains a big-height item, chips doesn't seems to display properly. Here's an example : http://jsfiddle.net/ThibaudMZN/4q8aLpbs/30/ @doughballs Thank you CSS wizard :D 
solution: 

issue: @jaykkkkkk I think the images sometimes take a while to loads as they’re hosted elsewhere 
solution: you were right, its working now. thanks. All input fields should have a unique id and for label.. 

issue: @adrshk not that I know...but in the past I've replaced the image with a span, and then placed the data I need attached to the span.... So yeah I went into autocomplete.js, found the line that adds the image src, changed that to be data-src (so it doesn't show a broken image link), turned the image opacity to zero, and then that allowed me to access the data-src of the selected el, which I set as an ID when building data. If that makes sense..! @crazygmr101 looks like you’ve got two cards inside each col s12 m6, so they’ll always show side by side. Each card should go in its own col to be responsive. Also separate your container from your row - the layout should be container > row > col > card

solution: 

issue: @wisnukm41 elems is declared variable. before using a method, you have you init js with id 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs  here, the instance is still undefined https://jsfiddle.net/3a9ph2u1/1/ @saiananth1 yes, but its `elems` not `elem` i just confuse what is this `elem` refering to when you initialize the instance to access the `.next()` method

solution: 

issue: this code works, thanks.why doesn't this code work? can it be something in my project?var instance = M.Carousel.getInstance (elem);instance.next ();

issue: i dont know what elem is here, if you try to console log the instance it will return undefined. glad the code works 
solution: 

issue: @lkusam no problem, and welcome!

It looks like you've got a lot going on there, and the sidenav is a bit wonky, and appears to have a full size navbar inside.My suggestion would be to break your site down into sections, comment out all but section 1, get section 1 working/looking right, then uncomment section 2. Very hard to fix everything all at once.

issue: @Adebayo3322 I don't think Dogfalo will respond personally, but show us what you've got so far. 
solution: 

issue: real quick one, can't find anything in docs about it...does materialize require jquery? 
solution: 

issue: :-D funny you should mention the select...that's what made me start wondering, I can't seem to get it to work.  I'm using Svelte and trying to to use that example but it's not working, I thought maybe I should be installing jquery. 
solution: 

issue: @Adebayo3322 that wont work. The key concepts:1) Follow the correct structurecontainer > row > colsOne container, one row inside, then several cols inside this.s12 m12 l12 = take up all 12 columns, at any widths12 m6 = take up 12 cols on mobile, then 6 cols (half width) on medium and up 
solution: 

issue: [FormSelect]0: FormSelect {el: select, $el: Init(1), options: {…}, isMultiple: false, _keysSelected: {…}, …}length: 1__proto__: Array(0) 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs Hey, so I tried the code you laidout in CSS but both cols seems to be glued to the center. http://127.0.0.1:3000/# 
solution: 

issue: @Adebayo3322 As you can see from my example, the columns will take up the full width of the screen by themselves, so they must be inside a containing element in your example. Nothing else could restrict their width.

issue: Hey guys, i am trying to make my parallax height into a percentage so it is responsive but I am having no luck? in my css it shows: ```.parallax-container{ height: 40%}``` but nothing appears, but only when i use "px" i have used te same code as the demo: 
solution: 

issue: Did you use the exact same structure from the docs?https://materializecss.com/dropdown.html @UmeshBachchani link to your code please Just the dropdown part, don't paste in here - build a codepen instead. @billyclark flex is pretty much magic anyway, why not use it. That’s all valign-wrapper is. @danishroshan you’ll need to link to your project.

solution: 

issue: Better way would be to not use columns at all. One single wrapper with flex, space between, align Center should do it.

solution: 

issue: @ThibaudMZN could you not inject an a tag into the dom at the location you need it on keypress, and trigger the dropdown all in one movement? 
solution: Is there a way to offset the actual dropdwon content ? Since right now it's opening literraly on top of the <a> tag. 

issue: @ThibaudMZN what are trying to do? I think default behaviour on select is to close, with no hook like onSelect. (I don't really use dropdowns so not sure.) I got this to get the value though:]https://codepen.io/doughballs/pen/WNvZVMx 
solution: 

issue:  This snippet above works perfectly outside a JSX expression, but when inserted into an expression formatted like so:```{filterBy === 'name' ? (    // Filter by name...) : filterBy === 'priority' (    <div className="input-field col s8">        <i className="fas fa-exclamation-circle prefix"></i>        <select            id="priority"            name="priority"            value={priority}            onChange={onChange}        >            <option value="" disabled>                Filter...            </option>            <option value="low">by Low Priority</option>            <option value="norm">by Normal Priority</option>            <option value="high">by High Priority</option>        </select>        <label htmlFor="priority">Filtering by Priority Level</label>    </div>) : filterBy === 'location' && (    // Filter by location...)}```The dropdown elements vanish. I tested enabling only the browser defaults and the dropdown reappears so the issue seems to be happening in the Materialize CSS as it interacts with JSX. 
solution: 

issue: @wolffle you need to initialise selects after they are added to the DOM. @TheMasteredPanda I don't really understand your code but could possibly due to mixing jquery with vanilla JS, more the vanilla part not grabbing the right instance, 
solution: 

issue: @bloobsky not sure what the issue is then. Have you inspected the nav? Is your css showing up and being overridden? 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs Yes sorry, I cleared the cache of the browser and it works . Thanks a lot. All the best !!!

solution: 

issue: [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/QJFa/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/Dogfalo/materialize/QJFa/image.png) 
solution: 

issue: @jcmafra why the function to close the modal? Modal already closes via the close-modal class provided in the documentation. If you copy and paste the code from the docs, and initialise via vanilla JS, you don’t need any other code to get it to work. 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs  thanks for very much for your replyI'd tried to close with class modal-close (<a class="modal-close waves-effect waves-light btn">Cancelar</a>) but when I click in the button nothing happens. I'm working with Google Script WebApp, can it makes any difference? I insert a onclick event on button and it send the message to console. 
solution: 

issue: what is the JQ mask, and what is the console error? @jcmafra nothing wrong with your modal HTML. I took that, plus the following JS, and it works fine:      var elems = document.querySelectorAll('.modal');      var instances = M.Modal.init(elems);      instances[0].open();https://codepen.io/doughballs/pen/GRpbVGd @jcmafra Maybe, I don't use it so can't really help... That is not copied from the docs. Javascript goes at the end, before the closing body. Please use the snippets from the docs until you’re familiar. @SurpUser boilerplate is here:https://materializecss.com/getting-started.html#setup 
solution: 

issue: Hello!I'm Francis Castillo,I have copied the example you have on the page exactly the same, but it does not work for me, it is the Dropdown version of 1.0.0, I hope you will answer me, thanks. @doughballs ok thanks!

solution: 

issue: @howimetmyself do you mean force the footer to the bottom, or have the footer always visible (like a navbar)? @lluttrell take out the options variable from the init. @BigodeSan live link or codepen please. @JamilHussain510  have you read this?https://medium.com/@mattdlockyer/youre-using-materialize-css-wrong-470b593e78e9 
solution: 

issue: @BigodeSan I see. I did check mobile, iPad and desktop in chrome but not on an actual mobile. I’ll check again. @BigodeSan so it looks like you're using angular, not my area unfortunately. But I did some work on the a dynamic height carousel - we find out the height of the image, then set the carousel to be that height. Take a look at the bottom functions in this pen, may or not be any help to you. The issue with explicit height is it's not always suitable depending on image size.https://codepen.io/doughballs/pen/VwvMgRd

issue: Hi again, I'm trying to add a onchange (or onclick) event on a select from materialize, but I can't achieve to trigger the event on click, I know that the lib is faking the select by adding an ul and li, but is there a way to actually do it ?

issue: I can't seem to fix this problem where the checkbox for item C appears in the previous column: https://codepen.io/bill-long/pen/GRoZNrR. This only happens when the box is checked. I tried `break-inside: avoid` at every level to no avail. If I remove the `top: -4px` style from checked+span:not(.lever):before, that works, but... yuck. 
solution: 

issue: @bill-long, why aren’t you using the Materialize grid system? 
solution: 

issue: ‘.col s4’ around each checkbox will do it. With a single row around those. Lean on the framework, that’s what it’s there for .container > .row > all your cols @nudl3s anything is possible, but not out of the box - you’ll need to code it yourself. I believe Materialize gives you a hook to get all chip data. So it’s just a case of anytime a chip is added, get the data, and set it to be the value of your other input.

issue: @bhavinpatel47 no problem at all :) 
solution: 

issue: @Darvinschl that's fine, whatever works for you. I personally could not go back to straight CSS. If you're working on a big client site that is likely to change, it's a life saver. Take this scenario. Client chooses a color and uses it throughout the site. Later, they decide to change the color. (Or the padding you've used on every section, or the font-size etc ect). Instead of trawling through 1000s of lines of css to find and replace, you just change the root color once:`$primary: #F1F1F1;` 
solution: 

issue: So a compiler i can run for example with a batch file? Because i upload my changes with starting a batch file and it would be nice if it automatically compiles the sass to css before uploading 
solution: 

issue: but for the color example he could just use a root variable right? But you're right there Sean. Sass makes things easier 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs Hmm. Let me preface anything I'm about to say/ask with the fact I am not a coder by trade.  The way the select is currently being populated with with Google Apps Script. I am pulling values from a column in Google Sheets to populate the select. I want to prevent having to reload the entire app I'm not really sure how to do that with your suggestion unfortunately. Ok. I'm using JS but I think I might be able to figure it out. 
solution: 

issue: I am having trouble with the html5 slider. Is there something I have to do to initialize it? It is working correctly but that neat little popup with the value is not showing 
solution: 

issue: Definitely need help translating this into JS`$('#my-select').append('<option value="4">Dynamically added Option 4!</option>');``$('select').formSelect();`Actually, all  of this code. https://codepen.io/doughballs/pen/LYGxEwb

issue: Hi everyone, I'm using the carousel display to show a bunch of cards and I have a huge top padding between the cards and the actual carousel object, any idea why ?

solution: 

issue: Hi all. I have a requirement to encapsulate some dropdowns within a shadow root. It was fairly easy to get everything bundled up within the root from a css perspective, but was curious if anyone has had any luck with being able to get events to bubble up to the documents materialize js import for events. 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs Thanks. I'll give it a try. Looks very similar to something I already tried but I probably missed something in my attempt. 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs I'm wondering. This is not executing on a DOMContentLoaded but when the `addNewProduct()` function finishes executing

issue: i got it! its just a bit wonky the way they implemented it

issue: Extended Navbar with Tabs not working ? any hot fixes 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs Hi Sean. Thanks for all the help. Quick question. Do you have any idea why your code isn't working for me? I think it might have to do with the way I am using `withSuccessHandler`https://codepen.io/dkonig/pen/jOWypvy 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs Just got back to my code. I stripped out the code I had in my `updateProductDropdown` function and just dropped an alert in there. The new product I add does indeed get passed. So, again, I am stuck on getting the select to update with the `newProd` value. I think this is a matter of re-instantiating that select but I just can't seem to figure out how to do that. The code you provided in your Codepen adds the new item on page load and not on a text field submit. 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I can't control the colors and fonts of <select multiple>...where can I find information? Thanks, https://codepen.io/edu16/pen/WNrpJQR 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs It's the init I can't get to work to refresh that select. If I can just get the select to refresh it should pull the select values from the spreadsheet(including the one I added). I've even tried going this route which does add an option but it doesn't appear in the rendered HTML.        function updateProductDropdown(newProd){          newProdOption = document.getElementById('product');          newProdOption.innerHTML += '<option>' + newProd + '</option>';          alert(newProdOption.innerHTML)       } Hmm. Can't get it to work. No. Will the reset all the selects? Ooooo. It's working. I swear I tried that before! 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs So the init needs to run at the end of `updateProductDropdown`function? If so how would you code that? 
solution: 

issue: ok, thats strange because i didnt give .btn class  name to the button, but when I click on them ,they become green! and I didnt actually stylised them at all!

issue: Hello.  I'm new to Materialize & this group.  Working on integrating Materialize into my code, and stripping out Bootstrap v3.  I need help with Modals. When it comes to modals, I need to attach events onCloseEnd.  In my particular case, I need to be able to change what happens "onCloseEnd" after the modal is already open.  So starting it with the proper function is NOT an option.  How can I change the "onCloseEnd" event AFTER the modal is open? 
solution: 

issue: Re-initializing doesn't seem to work, unless I "destroy" the modal, which is not an option for me.  :-(

issue: @computerwiz12890 does the documentation page work for you in IE? Just had a quick look and can't see any support issues from a style perspective... 
solution: 

issue: @computerwiz12890 I can't test as I don't have access to IE. I guess your options are use inspector to fix the style issue and then implement it, or, don't use the loader in the modal. 
solution: I can test it out for you. Of course, I just don't use internet explorer anymore. We don't even support IE on our website.. 

issue: @tuffant21 Thank you.  That may be part of my problem, but it didn't fix it yet.  I must have some conflicting code somewhere.  I will strip a lot out and try to build it back up. 
solution: 

issue: Interestingly, I think it is your code that is broken Ah, got it. You have an extra closing brace Here you go. Replace your code with this. 
solution: 

issue: Ok, I'll dig into it tomorrow from that perspective.  It's 18 minutes past time for me to leave work!  Thanks  :-) 
solution: 

issue: @tuffant21 Yea, I had fixed that typo.  Your codepen is helpful.  I added the init to the Codepen and it is working nicely.  It gives me hope that I can get this fixed.  JS and CSS are not my specialty.  =) 
solution: Haha, sweet. I hope you get it fixed, let us know if you need anymore help. 

issue: @tuffant21 Thank you again.  I found the errors.  The most significant had to do with M.AutoInit getting called twice (the second time at the very, very bottom of the page.)  It was helpful to have some working code to start from.

solution: 

issue: @doughballs  thank you for you answer. Im using materialize through CDN, not by installing it. According to this, I guessed it should be enough to copy the script in my index.html, but as far as I could se so far, it seems to be like an incompatibility versions problem. But I dont find an actualized version of this problem in the fora.

solution: 

issue: Yes, I tried it now it worked, but it's so ugly especially because I have too few records, can't I just make it appear outside the table itself? 
solution: 

issue: Yeah, materialize will make html code for you automatically and that is likely what is happening here. That's why I thought about the container option in the documentation. Maybe that will initialize it in the actual container you specify 
solution: 

issue: @tuffant21  thak you for your answer.

issue: Do you have a JSfiddle I could take a look at ? strangely enough the container doesn't seem to work 
solution: @BestDr You did something with tables and dropdowns right? Would you be able to provide any insight?> oh yes it worked, I passed the body as a container and now it shows even on top of the table. 

issue: https://jsfiddle.net/ThibaudMZN/jxarwb7f/12/ this is what i got so far, I can trigger the dropdown but it's not contained in the proper row and stays where the invisible anchor is 
solution: 

issue: Here ye go https://codepen.io/tuffant21/pen/MWKdXdN That's actually kind of cool 
solution: 

issue: And you don't need the container. You just need this:```#dropdown1 {  position: fixed;}``````const instance = document.getElementById('dropdown1');instance.style.top = e.pageY + "px";instance.style.left = e.pageX + "px";```

issue: Hi @edunsouza it’s looking fine on iPhone, what device/browser is the problem? So odd! I'm getting the opposite behaviour! I'm not sure then. Maybe someone else can chip in. 
solution: 

issue: Also, just to clarify, the 1.0.02 version is not working great for me in iPhone XR. In fact I’d describe this as broken! While the current version 1.0.0 is working great. 
solution: 

issue: Isn’t swipeable meant for mobile devices? Are you sure you got the two examples the correct way around? The behaviour you describe I was seeing on v 1.0.2 @SamShalby and this doesn't work? Take the height of the largest card at each breakpoint, then set all cards to have that height. 
solution: 

issue: @slimbde you could add offset-s3, to offset it by 3 cols (Materialize is 12 column grid, so 3 offset, then 6 for your input would center it.

issue: Hello, help me pls. Does not work tabs on materializecss 1.0.0 with JQuery 3.5.1. Materializecss 0.97 is works.. Mmm, my page - seoant.ru/tabs.html 
solution: 

issue: Are you kidding me? A working version since 0.97 was taken from the codepen, but my site is running 1.0.0. Above, I threw off the link with my tabs, without anything else. Open it through the debugger. 
solution: And also, jQuery is not a dependency of materialize any more.. 

issue: @secwayz why don't you just use version 1.0.0 
solution: @SamShalby I use it. 

issue: I can't remember exactly where i had it but i'm going solve it again and sent it to u 
solution: I think @doughballs has done some work with changing colors. 

issue: dam it I can't remember how i approached it. Let's see if sean is around 
solution: 

issue: I had some css but that only changes the backgroundcolor when :focus , and indeed I have tried to change the input background , there's no way 
solution: Yes I don’t think the guy is talking about changing the underline color, though I do have a pen for that.. I know what he meant , the field , or textarea.

solution: 

issue: https://materializecss.com/collapsible.html#initialization Take out the options variable if you’re not using any options. 
solution: 

issue: This code, where do I insert it? This is my question 
solution: 

issue: Why the period here? : `./testejs.js` and also, take out the options variable (like I already mentioned):`var instances = M.Collapsible.init(elems);`And remove everything to do with jQuery. You need one or the other  not both. 
solution: 

issue: Even using only js it still didn't work. I don't know if I went wrong somewhere, or what happened. When I run the html this error appears in the browser..  Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined    at testejs.js:2 (testejs.js it's my file javascript) 
solution: That because you're trying to use jQuery and don't have jQuery sourced.... 

issue: @unnati2000 the easier way we do it is use jquery let us know if that works for u. otherwise you will have to ask Sean. I'm still new to react frame work myself Hide-on-small-only https://materializecss.com/helpers.html @lkusam hope that help

issue: Oh my gosh. 100+ messages Crazy 
solution: 

issue: hello guys, I am Carlos from Spain I have some troubles making the carousel work, I think it could be non bootstrap-compatible. Am I right? 
solution: 

issue: @carpars hi. If you are using materializecss and bootstrap together then you will run into problems as they share a lot of classnames. 
solution: Materialize doesn’t use a dropdown inside the sidenav, it uses collapsible, as I think the experience is better. So that could be the issue, I’ve personally never used a dropdown in a side nav.... 

issue: Hi,I'm trying to use slider in a page but instead i got a grey rectangle, i tried to right-click and display the image in a new tabs and it works so it's not the image the problem.I init the slider with the autoinit method (M.AutoInit()), i have no error in the console. I'm using materializecss 1.0.0.Does anyone have an idea to fix the problem ?

issue: Hi Everybody! I'm a developer from Italy, I just joined room because I think I found a bug and I'd like to get feedback from you guys! :) 
solution: 

issue: @Paolo-N you can open an issue - the docs needs a total overhaul - but tbh very little in being done at the moment so don't hold your breath! If you have any questions or issues, you're much more likely to get a response in here. Not sure where this breaks down but you need to run a loop and append an <option> inside the select for each one. Then when this loop has run, run the initialisation on it. 
solution: 

issue: Sean Doherty Thanks a lot!!!, I found the solution from your last word. The problem was that I first initialised and then ran the loop but now I fixed it and it is all working fine.

issue: @tuffant21 or anyone else - any idea how to adjust sidenav to remove this warning:materialize.min.js?ver=1.0.0:6 [Violation] Added non-passive event listener to a scroll-blocking 'touchmove' event. Consider marking event handler as 'passive' to make the page more responsive.

solution: 

issue: @royalcode on the docs it specifies the format option [<-LINK->] @doughballs when you add an event listener, it's usually in the form of element.addEventListener(type, callback, options) If you pass in false in the options, I think it fixes that
solution: Answered my own question re the event listener thing: [<-LINK->]

issue: @AlphaX2018 what’s the issue? 
solution: 

issue: After Materialize you should link to your own custom js file. Call it init.js maybe - and put it in a folder called js. In this script you need a single document.ready (see the docs page for each component) and then inside this you put the line or lines for each initialisation as stated in the docs. Word of warning - if using the vanilla Js init, take out the options variable if you are not setting any options. 
solution: 

issue: doesn't help, the issue is with the sizes and not the placement, or the display property 
solution: 

issue: @Pierstoval Ah, you may be correct!  The blue background appears on Chrome, but not Firefox.  Thanks. 
solution: 

issue: ok i found that wp_enqueue has additional variables to allow loading scripts in "footer". I can see the init.js now in the page code, but how can i test if the path and everything is ok? when I click on the js path link, the theme provides an error, i guess for protection reason

solution: 

issue: not sure if this has been asked before, but is there a way to make "hidden" work on css materialize select? only "disabled" and "selected" is working for options 
solution: 

issue: So if phone, chat, or email is selected, the select box should display phone, chat, and email. But, if they open the select again, the select modality should be selected? 
solution: 

issue: Oh, remove the selected attribute It will be the default item shown, but won't show up once something is selected [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/548e71a2db8155e6700df25f/WST9/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/548e71a2db8155e6700df25f/WST9/image.png) 
solution: 

issue: i actually have other select elements. this one is just a sample. adding "value=''" works for me. thank you 
solution: 

issue: @koteswar375 I don't think so - one of strengths of materialize is cleaner, more semantic markup. You can always write your own helpers, but ultimately, they are not the most maintainable solution. Imagine you have dozens of pages, and you need to adjust one of those helper classes, on some but not all divs that contain it...! Much easier to declare your global padding in your own stylesheet. @computerwiz12890 the closest thing in M is autocomplete with minLength:0 to trigger the list immediately, but you’d have to custom code or use 3rd party for something more elaborate. 
solution: 

issue: @HaichH Yes there is: https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular2-materialize-v1 this is one I developed. It uses materialize >= v1.0.0For versions <= 0.100 use this library https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular2-materialize 
solution: 

issue: Hi, i'm using chips but limit option is not working. Why could be  the issue? 
solution: 

issue: Could be any number of things. Do you have any code to share? 
solution: 

issue: I get this error in chrome when using Materialize: $>$ Added non-passive event listener to a scroll-blocking 'touchstart' event. Consider marking event handler as 'passive' to make the page more responsive.
solution: check the fork for details on how to fix: [<-LINK->]

issue: @computerwiz12890 I’m only just getting around to using github I am also a team of 1! But it’s not just for collaboration and great at keeping track of anything that’s progressing (my custom starter theme for example). Just go to issues and add new I think. Follow the notes. I think the team will flag it as a feature request as it’s not technically an issue. 
solution: 

issue: That looks like what I need @weirdjon!  Thanks!  I'll have to dig into it to see how they got it to work, but it seems to behave like I need.  :-) 
solution: 

issue: @akiragunawan maybe try declaring a height on .carousel and using ! !important 
solution: 

issue: what do you mean by using !  ? im sorry but i dont understand what is that and how to use it, i found nothing in docs 
solution: 

issue: @monster153 I responded on Stack Overflow 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs I edited the code as well in stackoverflow 
solution: 

issue: does anybody have any idea why clicking a materialize checkbox makes the page scroll and even it looks like it increases the height of a parent element for some reason (I can't figure that element out) 
solution: 

issue: @BestDr  have you specified a height for parent ? i mean in the code pen @doughballs I think the problem the destroy function does not actually exist even though i am using version 1.000 
solution: 

issue: @monster153 I ran into this issue as well. I'm a little busy at the moment, so I just want to code dump this here for you [select.tar.gz](https://files.gitter.im/548e71a2db8155e6700df25f/C7cS/select.tar.gz) open a console and run `tar -xzvf select.tar.gz` to extract @monster153 Oh lord. Durp. 
solution: 

issue: @monster153 `can you try instances[0], and also, I can't see any declaration of your options.` 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs instances is not an array sry the variable name is a bit confusing but it just store the instance of initiated carousal @tuffant21 i am not using select component i have a problem with the carousal @BestDr  try setting the height value with px not precentage @doughballs the code pen link is not working 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs yes that is correct.. so like TODAY on September 28 2020, i can select sep 28, 2020 and save it to db. when i open same date picker later tomorrow or anytime in future i want to show that current selected date is September 28 2020,so  lets say user opens same date picker tomorrow and wants to change selected date, they HAVE to select date that is either sep 29, 2020 or later and as soon as user selects new date, old one will get replaced so min date is to limit user from selecting past date.. but i dont want that to apply to default date because im setting that from old records.. 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs if i remove all the carousel-item it gives me this error Cannot read property 'clientWidth' of undefined @doughballs so i can not do what you suggested

solution: 

issue: that is what I actually am trying but still no luck. will upload my code on code pen in a bit. let me check if i have missed something . thanks @doughballs 
solution: 

issue: Hi everyone. I created a new project and added `"type": "module"` to package.json to use ES modules and use` import()` instead of `require()`. However, I have a file, where I want to find some files and the only way I know to do that is by using `require.context()`. But when I do that, I get an error: [<-CODE->]
solution: Does your project run in Node or in the browser? If browser, then I need more context around the error, because I don't understand what's causing it. If your code runs in Node, use the `fs` package to interact with the file system.

issue: @harri00413 hi, I've used datepicker with these errors and I've a lot of problems on iOS Safari. 
solution: 

issue: @Volodymyr-1967  @anandmys We need code to help 
solution: 

issue: So let me see if I'm understanding this correctly. You have a select initially. If a user selects an option, it should show another select. However, that select is not showing? If that's correct, it is likely because you have not initialized the second select. If you can't dynamically initialize the second select, what I would do is render the select regardless and then use css to hide it until a user selects the first option 
solution: 

issue: Anyone have a better way to clear all checked options in Multiple Select, preferably in vanilla JS? Currently doing this: ```document.querySelectorAll("ul.dropdown-content li.selected:not(.disabled)").forEach(el => {    el.click();});``` 
solution: 

issue: Wait, is it as easy as doing this...```        selectEl.value = "";        M.FormSelect.init(selectEl);``` I swear like 75% of the problems I face are because I forgot to initialize something, lol 
solution: 

issue: @strel0k I feel your pain! There is an M.autoInit() function that initialises everything, can be useful if if you don't need customization. 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs you ever have a Firefox specific issue like this with the datepicker? [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/548e71a2db8155e6700df25f/FNsl/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/548e71a2db8155e6700df25f/FNsl/image.png) ```        <div class="input-field col s12 m6 l3">            <input type="date" id="date-of-birth" class="validate" min="1900-01-01">            <label>Date of Birth</label>        </div>``` 
solution: 

issue: Yeah now that I added `for="date-of-birth"` to the label it now lets me select the field but the label still overlaps the form Here is a relevant post https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54080453/cant-type-into-password-input-field-using-materialize-1-0-0-in-firefox 
solution: 

issue: Actually, better yet because I can't figure out how to write an angular template on codepen. Go to https://staging.thehomepainter.comThen in the top right, there will be a circular menu with a little profile image. Click that and try to click anything. "My project" works, most of the time."All projects" works most of the time"Messages" will sometimes work. Most of the time it wont."Contact us" directs you to the next li element "our story""Log in" doesn't work at all. And it's only on ios. No other device [Image from iOS.MP4](https://files.gitter.im/548e71a2db8155e6700df25f/Tn4F/Image-from-iOS.MP4) I'm okay with removing the animation. How would I do that? 
solution: 

issue: @strel0k I have to write some extra css to make that class work with materalize (basically, disable it for mobile) .valign-wrapper { display:block !important; } And that wrapped in a media query that targets up to m, so up to 600px wide. But yeah, you can’t mix flex with floats and the grid system very well. 
solution: 

issue: Hi! Does someone get this https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/1527 to work? I can’t make it work - no matter what I do, the select pushes the modal scroll 
solution: 

issue: Hard to know without seeing your code. Always use 1.0.0, forget about 1.0.2 
solution: MM shame because seems here https://github.com/kcahir/materialize/commit/24b387bd6c68aa8376ed7b8fc6d5a8cc5db41c4c. I think I’ll have a look and patch it myself :S.

issue: Hi, in future releases can  .no-autoinit work on any dom element container, not just the input fields.  I'd like to ignore entire sections from initialize. 
solution: 

issue: Thx, I tried  the autoInit() route.... it works but disables page scrolling...$('i.form_button').on('click tap', function() {        forms += 1;        var repeat_blank = $('#' + this.id.replace('button', 'blank'));        $('#insert_here').before(repeat_blank.html().replace(/\[BLANK\]/g, forms));        updateTasks();        M.AutoInit(context=document.getElementById("form_recipe"));      }); The page scroll disable seems to happen when the DOM has initialized and non-initialized materializecss objects. When I run M.AutoInit(context=document.getElementById("form_recipe")); twice on a fresh DOM no problems,  As soon as I do it after the $('#insert_here').before(...) scroll locks. Just ran a test... any call to M.AutoInit(context=????) locks scroll after $(???).before(...) I'll give it a try thanks.

solution: 

issue: ```document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {  // fill in the select element with a number of options});$(document).ready(function(){    $('.sidenav').sidenav();    $('select').formSelect();  });``` Thank you so much, when I re-init the select after adding the options, everything works like a charm! ok, thank you.. I'm not very into JS stuffs, still a learner :-) 
solution: 

issue: @doughballs Do you have any ideas for my issue ? :) @doughballs Thank you :) It works :) 
solution: 

issue: @dna1969 sorry I don't use angular. All I can say is make sure you initialize all components correctly after every re-render. The init should be part of the render. @rebootcode sorry, I don't use Chips and that was an old example for someone else. You can easily convert that code to vanilla. `instance[0].getChipData()` - something like that.

solution: 

issue: @JoshuaVSherman you may be better looking to the fork, which is moving forward at good pace https://github.com/materializecss/materialize @VelDeveloper there is nothing in materialize that offers this. But you could get all your table data in loop and re-render for the sort, and add class names to each tr for the filter, then hook up to a simple button. @siropa81 hey, do you mean Select? And have you played around with the css at all? I can see the demo is working fine at https://materializecss.com/select.html  @trigaten hey, I believe whatever is inside the tag will be the prefill. So use open and closing textarea tags. @cimenta the component is probably not as sophisticated as you need it to be. You can hack the JS to do something more useful with the image (for instance, either store an id as the image src using data-src, or hard coding an id into the image src itself and retrieving later). So maybe have a dig around in the js file if you’re comfortable playing around, or you may be better using a more elaborate 3rd party solution (select2 for example) https://css-tricks.com/snippets/html/autocomplete-off/ this may work for the browser autocomplete

The yearRange refers to the year dropdown - how many years are shown. The user can still click back and forward through the months, but since the dates are not selectable, it's not a big problem.

I have content on this page and when I click on tab link changes to id and srolls to id 
solution: 

issue: @stecko1980 that's not really what tabs are intended for. They are for hiding and showing content directly below. I would just use a nav link and set the href to the section anchor instead.

issue: Hello! Im using vue.js, how can i run a function before oper a modal? open* 
solution: 

issue: You can force that class at any screen size you like. Just adjust the media query. My point is, you're adding the grid system to a table - two things with conflicting styles, different display and sizing properties  - so making order out of that might not be easy. I think the responsive table class is not what you need, as you want the scroll bar in the opposite axis. 
solution: 

issue: I see.  I do like the % sizing that I get from the "s1 s2 s3, etc." classes.  Would it be better to just do the % myself? 
solution: 

issue: Lol yes, exactly.When I say "goes funky", I mean the 2nd row will slide under the 1st one.  Like it's just a regular data row.  And I don't think that method will work, because I'm also trying to account for smaller resolutions/window sizes.  Different sizes can cause some headers to wrap & take up more space, so I don't think the "sticky" solution would work, because you'd have to know ahead of time exactly how much height you'd need, correct?

issue: @ManuTheCoder when exactly do you need it to expand, and when to contract? There’s a snippet in the startup theme that turns a navbar solid from transparent. It’s transparent when the page it at the top of the viewport (0) and solid if anywhere below  (>0). Would this work? 
solution: 

issue: When you say use the "top" property.... what exactly are you meaning? 
solution: use some improve  like this```.something {top: 20px;}```. or ```<label class="waht you want" style="top: 20px;">```.

issue: @sisaha9 that is not good UX in my opinion. It is actually a little bit pointless if you thinking about it. But, you could use collapsible to get something similar. You would put a button inside the collapsible head, and change the styling to remove the lines etc. @bener07 what are you trying to do? Just copy the example from the docs and use the correct markup, then amend to fit your needs. @albcorare26 looks like your content is inside a container...

issue: @kjq221 you need to put class of responsive-img to stop images spilling outside of their container.
