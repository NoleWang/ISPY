issue:  @AndreasCag Thanks. I've tried it b4 and it also didn't work. That's when my growing confidence in my webpack skills got a bit of a shake.The simple solution is to make sure the order is `vendors CCP` before `manifest CCP`.There's a more robust solution like this: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/4638#issuecomment-347362649, but it's an overkill for what I need ATM

issue: Hello everybody. i'm a newbie with webpack. I added recently this new line to my webpack config: https://gist.github.com/Nek-/26f311180357d50254ab0491ceba5a82#file-webpack-config-js-L43It's supposed to add assets support so I can get `http://localhost:8080/assets/phaser.png` but I get a 404 error each time I try it. I don't understand why. I tried many different solutions and nothing seems to work. I must have miss something. Here is my directory structure:```.├── node_modules├── package.json├── README.md├── src│   ├── assets│   ├── index.html│   └── main.ts├── tsconfig.json└── webpack.config.js``` Fixed! My dev server was not configured as expected. I changed from `dist/` to `src/`. :)

issue: Hello. I have a fresh install of webpack and webpack-dev-server. When I run `yarn exec webpack-dev-server` I get `Error: Cannot find module './codes.json'`. I'm relatively new to node and yarn and not sure where to go from here. https://gist.github.com/tatey/0dbf10bd3ccac73a798be594d561bd49. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated. 
solution: 

issue: maybe you load your data from ./codes.json while the path in your code is wrong 
solution: 

issue: Indeed. I peeked into `/Users/Tate/Desktop/fu/node_modules/statuses/index.js` and it is trying to load `code.json` relative to that directory. Looking at https://github.com/jshttp/statuses/tree/v1.3.1 it should be in there, but it's not there in my installation. FYI I blew away `./node_modules` and did a `yarn cache clean` and now it works :D 
solution: @tatey  Congratulation. 

issue: I'm trying to debug webpack to know how it works internally, ive linked my folder webpack into my project, and ran `node --inspect node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js --env.prod --colors ` which gave me the following error message:  `Cannot find module 'webpack/lib/RequestShortener'`.No idea how to fix this.

issue: Hey everyone, I'm wanting to do a dynamic import on the browser side (I know Chrome supports this) however I can't seem to find a way to get webpack to ignore it. I have tried the ignore plugin, that doesn't bundle the dynamic module, but it still tries to resolve (and therefore errors). I also tried using __non_webpack_require__ but that turns it into "require", whereas I need "import" (as that's the browser syntax). Is there an equivelant to this for import? Basically I just want webpack to completely ignore this 1 line of code.

issue: Hi guys. I wa wondering if i can exclude some libraries from my bundler and instead get them via cdns? For example in my webpack based app, i need to use Firebase which is a huge library. I dont want firebase to be added to my bundle.js. I'd rather it was pulled from a cdn. I'd really want the bundle.js to contain just my code. Can I do this? 
solution:

solution: 

issue: yeah i dont know if you can turn off the existence check and still run a loader yes, but i dont think you can run a loader if you turn off handling `url()` so what is the problem? 
solution: 

issue: @lohfu, well I could turn off the handling of `url(...)` and have my own code parse the resulting CSS I would like to avoid that, but if it's the only option... @lohfu can't I chain loaders? I could have scss-loader -> css-loader -> my-url-loader -> style-loader @lohfu no problem, just imagining a possible solution Alternatively, maybe I could hook something onto 'postcss-loader' that does that 
solution: 

issue: @lohfu You mean with postcss-loader? I was thinking of processing the URL calls while it's still SCSS and then css-loader would already get valid file paths 
solution: i dont think you can parse the URL calls without webpack first checking for file existence there. you would have to parse all of the CSS being piped into your loader. 

issue: Hi all, does anyone know if there is a straightforward way to bundle files that are not specified in entry points? 
solution:

issue: Hi there, if I am authoring a webpack loader and want to share a resource between separate runs of the loader (i.e. on different files), what's the best way to do so? the exact scenario is that when loading `.graphql` files, i want to check them against a shared `schema.json` file i don't want to load the `schema.json` file on every invocation, since it can get pretty hefty at the same time, i would like for it to be a dependency for `.graphql` files so that when `schema.json` is updated, the `.graphql` files are invalidated as well i could just cache the `schema.json` file in my loader, but i'm not sure how i would go about invalidating/refreshing it when it changes

issue: Hello, anyone here who can answer some questions regarding dynamic imports? :) We are currently using `react-intl` and are using dynamic imports to require the locale-data.

issue: When using `webpack --watch` are changes written to disk? It seems like the initial compile writes files to `output.path` and any changes after that are not. Is there a way to force this? What's in the file? 
solution: 

issue: yes, but that defeats the purpose of bundling them which I would need to is there really not a way to just take the raw contents of a file and pipe it into the bundle? without wrapping it as a string or stuff like that the script-loader plugin oddly uses eval(), otherwise it would work for me

solution: 

issue: it gives me an error because I am using ES6 
solution: 

issue: the  webpack -p produces me an error I think it's because of ES6 syntax... it's an uglify error

solution: 

issue: when i use it to alias my scss directory, i use it like `import '~scss/somefile';` (from inside scss file) the tilde (~) was important, acts like an escape basically tells the sass-loader that webpack should resolve the path, instead of sass

issue: hi, I'm trying to resolve images from a json file using an "@" alias (dynamically) maybe this is not a good approach?

issue: Does someone know why ```jsconst config = {  host: nconf.get("host"),  port: nconf.get("port")};new webpack.DefinePlugin({ config }),```gives this error?`missing ) after argument list` 
solution: 

issue: @killerspaz, you can add an "exclude" option to babel-loader to tell it to ignore certain files. ```{        test: /\.js$/,        exclude: [          /node_modules/,          path.resolve(__dirname, "src/libs")        ],        use: [{          loader: "babel-loader",          options: {            cacheDirectory: true          }        }]      }``` actually, it's not a loader option, it's a rule option. in the above, it ignores node_modules and anything inside ./src/libs 
solution: 

issue: @akatechis but wouldn't that completely ignore all processing? I just want it to be included as a standard concatenated module, and not actually PROCESSED (ie, transpiled)... i belive exclude will just ignore the file completely 
solution: 

issue: No, in our set up, `exclude` will exclude the file from the rule, not the bundle. Did you actually try it? 
solution: 

issue: I found a bug at “Hot Module Replacement" in document,  the style-loader should use like "import style from './styles.css'" but not like "import from './styles.css' "

Sorry wrong channel 
solution: 

issue: We have a similar set up for our website, where we want to reference certain modules from a completely separate repo (our single page app), the way we did it (completely hacky, I know) was to add the SPA's directories to the `resolve.modules` option, so they get searched when a module says `require()`. One issue we had with this was the ordering of directories: if you have two modules, 1 in foo and 1 in bar, then the ordering of the directories in that array matters, because it will stop searching after finding the first match. So you'll want to be careful if you have generic names like "config.js" that just get imported. We also add foo/node_modules to the list so that packages that foo depends on, can be found. Not an ideal set up, at all, and we're looking at ways to move things into the same project so we dont have these sorts of "external" dependencies. Just this morning I broke a build, by renaming a file, and even though everything looked fine in one project, I found out later on, that the website broke because the module couldn't be found.

issue: We're seeing some strange output.  I put a gist here: https://gist.github.com/zentuit/af24021fa3d95b340413587c4984432e.  Basically we have a situation where the moduleID set for `__webpack_require__()` is incorrect; it is its own moduleID.  I'm assuming because the module in question is named the same as the one its importing.  I suspect it might also be the last module output that has the wrong moduleID but I can't confirm that.  How is the `moduleID` determined?  I'd like to track this down.

issue: Does anyone here know if you can use the new asset modules inline like you could with say raw loader?
solution: Spencer: [<-LINK->] gives a good overview "asset/source exports the source code of the asset. Previously achievable by using raw-loader.". Re-reading the question, it looks like you're trying to find override syntax, so you could e.g. configure `svg` as `type: asset` normally, but in one specific case, `require` the raw content instead.  Is that right?  If so, I haven't seen a way to do that, so it might be worth opening an issue.

solution: 

issue: @akatechis Ho yeah, this output.path was supposed to be in public. Thanks, I did not notice that yesterday! 
solution: 

issue: @tstackhouse, that is correct, webpack will crawl load your files and recursively build up a dependency graph of all your modules. The tricky thing is that loaders are responsible for adding files to the dependency graph. Eg, when webpack gets to your .less entrypoint, it doesn't know that @import is the import directive, and all the rules that are used to load those, so that stuff is implemented by the loader using the loader API  (https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/#this-adddependency). If the loader itself has some bug or issue, then that could lead to files not being loaded. 
solution: 

issue: I'm playing around with webpack 4, and so far I'm just using the CLI's error messages to understand the changes. Eg, I feed it my current config, and it throws an error for UglifyJSPlugin (because that's now builtin, and driven by `config.optimization.minimize` instead), so I'm planning on fixing that, and then keep going until I get it to stop complaining :) 
solution:

solution: @MhMadHamster Got you. Thanks. Unfortunately  I think I'm going to need to loop through all js chunks twice (or slice them) and not use excludeChunks. Thanks for the input though!.

Is there a way to do it in webpack too? It tells the error in a nicely formatted way in the console and the page Thanks

issue: I was reading about aggressive splitting plugin and was wondering at what bundle size should one consider the bundle to large and hence should be split or too small and should probably not be splitted further.

issue: I feel a bit stupid asking this, upgrading from 3.x.x to 4.x.x I'm having this error: `webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin has been removed, please use config.optimization.splitChunks` ok, what is config? I have webpack defined because I import it `const webpack = require('webpack')` but what is `config`? where come from? how do I import it? Is not explained, and docs aren't updated https://webpack.js.org/plugins/commons-chunk-plugin/

issue: this is kind of silly, i'm sure. how can i install v3 webpack, with webpack-dev-server? when i'm installing them now (`yarn add webpack@3 webpack-dev-server`) i'm getting an error that webpack-dev-server v3 expects webpack v4 
solution: 

issue: @dfee Just install a version that supports webpack 3, so that would be `webpack-dev-server@2.10.1` 
solution: 

issue: Manually setting `d3.event` doesn't work either, so it seems like I'm possibly not getting the actual export but somehow a ro version of its value. I may be wrong though, maybe it should not be settable?

solution: 

issue: @MhMadHamster  thanks! That got rid of warning, but I had to do `webpack-dev-server --mode development`Still something is not right, because `http://localhost:8080/` in the browser shows me the directory listing. 
solution: `Sgus` Adrian (Gitter): i use webpack-cleanup-plugin but last time i checked, they haven't updated for webpack4. 

issue: Any idea why despite installing webpack-cli (locally) via npm it's not being detected? I still get the "The CLI moved into a separate package: webpack-cli" message when running webpack .. I've checked and webpack-cli is indeed present in my node_modules directory 
solution: 

issue: are you sure it's the issue with webpack? i am having no errors with 4.0.1 and node 8.3 
solution: it looks like I need to use webpack-cli command. 

issue: If you've installed it locally, you have to run it from the local bin folder, i.e. either by using `npx` (npm >=v5.0.0) or as `./node_modules/.bin/webpack-cli`. Preferably, you should have a script in your package.json, where you don't need the npx or path to local .bin folder. 
solution: But you also need webpack-cli to run webpack config. @swassouf try replacing the `webpack` with `webpack-cli`. 

issue: css-loader localIdentNames and node_modules... Is there some wisdom on how this is supposed to work? because what's happening to me now is that the generated hashes don't match 
solution: 

issue: This page has errors https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/ it tells you to use the webpack-cli without telling you to install it! Very confusing for noobs 
solution: 

issue: Guys Does anyone else find that webpack is stupidly badly documented? I am using the "externals" option and I put `externals: { "velocity-animate": "velocity" }` And I get the error  Uncaught ReferenceError: velocity is not defined And I find out that the error is in this line `module.exports = velocity;` And yes. I am including including velocity from cdn before the bundled script What the hell is going on? 
solution:

issue: @TheDutchCoder hey figured I'd ping you here so we're not going back and forth in a tracking issue. So to work on docs would it be best to clone both webpack src and doc site src?

issue: Hi is there a global error handler for dynamic imports?

Instead of ``` import('lodash').then(_ => {    // Do something with lodash (a.k.a '_')...  }).catch(() => console.error('failed to load'));```I want to be handled on all dynamic imports 
solution: 

issue: @graingert can you elaborate? Sorry I did not follow 
solution: 

issue: Howdy all, wondering if anyone is using the new splitChunks functionality and if they know of a way I can achieve a structure like:```    [hash].js (chunk3)    [hash].js (chunk2)    [hash].js (chunk1)    [hash].js (chunk0 vendor etc.)    common.js    entry1.js    entry2.js```I've got a gist here: with better detail of my problem https://gist.github.com/jconroy/b8f5e31ddfc040faf69a37fad3acb065I think I'm just missing something (docs aren't finished yet) (oops didn't realise the gist would get expanded, sorry!)

solution: 

issue: why does this error message:  "__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0_numbro___default.a.culture is not a function"  happen when the numbro module is already installed? I am using webpack 3 
solution: 

issue: The config tells webpack what you want it to do, but something has to call webpack into action for it to run. That can be you on the command line, or you can trigger it from yet-another trigger, such as a make file, gulp or grunt, or even a hook that triggers it to run every time you save a file or commit to git. @tibetoine 
solution: 

issue: (I'm trying to define a publicPath, because I have an issue when loading font file in my environnement prod - But even after having definied my publicPath in absolute path, i have my issue .. so I'm wondering wether my webpack file is taken or not :( 
solution: Of note: > “The dev server uses Webpack’s watch mode. It also prevents webpack from emitting the resulting files to disk. Instead it keeps and serves the resulting files from memory.”—This means that you will not see the webpack-dev-server build in bundle.js, to see and run the build, you must still run the webpack command.. 

issue: Thanks @DavidLiedle . actually, it is exactly what i did, but I can't read any log, anywhere ... i look further .. sure :) What i wanted to say is that nothing is displayed ... so I guess nothing is reading my webpack.config.js :( 
solution: 

issue: @tibetoine The console log displays as text in your terminal; it is not saved to a file. This is easier to see if you change a console.log message to something like "HEY THIS IS THE CONSOLE LOG" so you'll see it pass by on the terminal if a lot of output is flying by. 
solution: 

issue: @DavidLiedle  ... ok i'm not sure of what I just did but 'ng eject' just di the job. ... Now i have a 500 line webpack.config.js file to full understand ... but i'm sure this one is used ! :)

issue: @GuillaumeCisco Yes, I have exactly the same problem since trying to migrate our app to Webpack 4 In smaller apps I haven't seen this issue, even though the same generated code is present Is the error that you see `Cannot read property bind of undefined`? Yeah, I agree the error shouldn't exist, but certainly does. They do feel very much like they could be related to the same thing though If `window["webpackJsonp"]` is defined, but not an array though, push wouldn't be defined on it and would cause `.push.bind` to produce the error @GuillaumeCisco I'm in the process of doing that I experimented with splitting and not splitting chunks, and received the same behaviour for both scenarios 
solution: 

issue: @stevethatcodes I just found out why I had the problem, issue with one of my dependency extract-webpack-css-chunks, you can see details in the issue I created earlier 
solution: 

issue: @GuillaumeCisco  Ooh, interesting, will take a look, thanks. I've stripped my stuff back a lot and have it working without the error now, so going to start adding back in the plugins/config from our Webpack 3 setup until I get the error again

issue: Hello. Is there documentation for webpack-dev-server Node API (to run it programmatically)? I found only the old one: https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/webpack-dev-server 
solution: webpack.js.org has some. if you're running webpack v4 and don't have really old browser requirements, check out https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-serve. 

issue: @shellscape thank you for the link. I read the documentation and there is only for the devServer as a command line tool. 
solution: bummer. i guess the next stop is to read the sourcecode for WDS in /bin/webpack-dev-server in the repo.

solution: it will quit. 

issue: I've not added this anywhere in my css 
solution: well, the plugin seems to no longer ignore it. so i suggest finding an alternative at this point. 

issue: @zGrav this works fine, thank you 
solution: npnp. 

issue: he has it already @wizardnet972 4.0.0-beta.0 is next  i have a weird ass issue with wp4 now and i'm not sure how to fix it lol

issue: @zGrav I see the mini-css-extract-plugin is creating css chunk files.. do you know , what needs to be done for not generating css chunk files? [![Screen Shot 2018-03-06 at 3.11.36 PM.png](https://files.gitter.im/webpack/webpack/kQad/thumb/Screen-Shot-2018-03-06-at-3.11.36-PM.png)](https://files.gitter.im/webpack/webpack/kQad/Screen-Shot-2018-03-06-at-3.11.36-PM.png) 
solution: 

issue: ExtractTextPlugin apparently breaks his stuff rn @krrssna-g-s there is no way to not chunk with it afaik 
solution: 

issue: @zGrav Thanks a lot.. my issues are resolved now.. 
solution: 

issue: Hey,I am using a minified javascript file which is bundled by webpack but this javascript file needs a memory initializer .mem file which is present locally subling to it. but webpack doesnot bundle it. So React gives an error `Uncaught could not load memory initializer Mp3LameEncoder.min.js.mem` Can any tell me what will I do?? 
solution: 

issue: @daniel-j no, you can't change the config of a created compiler. 
solution: 

issue: it doesn't mean that it contains documentation for webpack 4.1.0, simple example if you go to this pagehttps://webpack.js.org/plugins/commons-chunk-plugin/you will see there description about `CommonsChunkPlugin` but as you know it's deprecated since they released wepack4, and also in webpack4 they have added `optimization` configuration, but in current documentation you can't find any information about this. Right now webpack.js.org contains information only for webpack3 
solution: 

issue: you can go through all issues of webpack repo, sometimes there is very helpful information. this is what I've found > true.Agree! it is so confusing.. @alex1989 Do you have any info about stable release of webpack 4?no, I'm not webpack developer 
solution: 

issue: I suspect that is done in order to support things like hot reloading/hot module replacement. In those scenarios, you need to produce an updated build (in this case, a build that is broken), so that you see the error in the browser. It will also output that error to the console, when you're just doing a one-off build. 
solution: 

issue: @afhole  not for sure but I think it would be export someJson from './some-json.json'; 
solution: 

issue: Yes I am using named imports as above And using the direct export `export someJson from './some-json.json';` has the same effect I'm not sure if this is a bug or not 
solution: 

issue: well, dang. i'm going to dig up the spec, but i wonder if that implies that the `export { someBinding }` syntax just generally doesn't work on import bindings. 
solution: You'd think it would at least work on `export foo from 'foo'`. 

issue: hrmm... that's actually pretty interesting, as I think that's technically supposed to re-export any named exports. does the json-loader allow, e.g., `import { someKey } from './some.json';`? 
solution: 

issue: `import { default as articlePostSchema } from './article-post-schema';` does work to import it but is undefined in the export (but fine if I `export const foo = articlePostSchema`) 
solution: 

issue: FWIW my issue was closed, I am confused... 
solution: 

issue: Can you verify that you are calling `import()` in response to a navigation event in your app? Eg, when a user clicks to go to a second page,  only then is `import(...)` called to fetch the bundle Otherwise, if you just have a bunch of calls to `import()`, then it will just fetch those bundles as soon as your entry loads, which is probably not what you want. 
solution: 

issue: Actually merely importing a .js file makes it work, even if it isn't re-exported 
solution: 

issue: that definitely does not sound like expected behavior to me... /shrug then again, I'm not even sure of the syntax for all this stuff, so... :D 
solution: 

issue: The issue has been re-opened so there's hope yet Haha yeah the syntax is so complex I find it impossible to tell if my syntax is wrong or if there is a bug 
solution: 

issue: @akatechis , now im just trying to figure out having both $ and jQuery available. I'm getting an error in a jquery plugin file: Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined 
solution: are you using the ProvidePlugin as @jmar777_twitter shows? That will cause webpack to inject jquery into any module (such as your plugin) that references `jQuery`. 

issue: Did you try this yet?  [March 7, 2018 4:15 PM](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack?at=5aa0567ce4d1c63604d3ee73) 
solution: 

issue: looks like my issue might be specific to datatables.net went complete overkill.``` ```    new webpack.ProvidePlugin({        $: "jquery",        jQuery: "jquery",        'window.jQuery': 'jquery',        'window.$': 'jquery'    })``` that seems to have resolved that error. Last error, inside datatables. Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property '$' of undefined this.$ = function ( sSelector, oOpts ) is where the error occurs. WTH 
solution: 

issue: this is strange. I keeps jumping between this error inside dataTables, and then  $(....).dialog( is not  a function 
solution: 

issue: I dont think referring to `this` in the scope of a module is valid. You might need either a loader or to wrap the module in a function that passes the correct `this` as `window` 
solution: 

issue: @jmar777_twitter I'm using process.env to differentiate dev vs prod @jmar777_twitter one more question,  I was using webpack.BannerPlugin to print timestamp of my builds,  not its not working any more I'm in process of migration to WP4 ```plugins: [    new UglifyJsPlugin({      sourceMap: false,      extractComments: true,    }),    new MiniCssExtractPlugin({      filename: '[name]/common.css',      chunkFilename: env_bundle + '/[name].OD[chunkhash].css',    }),    new OptimizeCssAssetsPlugin(),    new webpack.BannerPlugin(' 2017 ' + new Date() + '\tBranch: '+ branch.sync()),    new webpack.optimize.OccurrenceOrderPlugin(true),  ],``` even though I added extractComments, this is not working any suggesstions? 
solution: 

issue: hang on, now I'm trying to run `webpack` straight and it's saying "The CLI moved into a separate package: webpack-cli.Please install 'webpack-cli' in addition to webpack itself to use the CLI." How are you supposed to use webpack these days???? Or should I just ditch the latest version and go back to using an old one that's not poorly thought out? 
solution: you need to install webpack-cli in addition to webpack 4. I can't install the webpack-cli because it requires git to be installed. 

issue: Is there a way to reference DllPlugins from the css-loader? For instance I have a url like `url('~assets/imgs/test.png')` where assets is the name of the dll but I keep getting `Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '~assets/imgs/test.png' in '/root/assets/styles/'` 
solution: 

issue: ah I see. So you're looking to sideload the jquery since there are two iterations pretty sure you can't do anything to the backend-based jQuery on webpack's instantiation so the only way is to do it manually 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I started new project, ran webpack and got Error: Cannot find module 'punycode/'. It was webpack 4 of course.

issue: how do I exclude multiple folders in my babel/eslint  rules? exclude: /node_modules/    works, but exclude: [/node_modules/, /js/vendor/] still works for node_modules, but not for my vendor directory 
solution: 

issue: @chrispickford You need the beta. Or use: https://twitter.com/wSokra/status/970253245733113856  But if you only wanna use stable versions, u should probably stay on webpack 3 for a little longer.

issue: Oh hm, I mean I need to check what the "outside" `NODE_ENV` is, but inside webpack it should be `production` because of `config.mode = 'production'` let me rerun to verify This was with 4.1.1, so that's definitely not the culprit [![2018-03-13 at 01.37.png](https://files.gitter.im/webpack/webpack/W0J1/thumb/2018-03-13-at-01.37.png)](https://files.gitter.im/webpack/webpack/W0J1/2018-03-13-at-01.37.png) And it's still there

issue: I started experimenting with upgrading to Webpack 4 and ran into the following error using `@turf/area`:`Can't import the named export 'lineString' from non EcmaScript module (only default export is available)`So I created a blank project with one file importing `@turf/area` to see if the issue would occur out-of-the-box. Conclusion: If don't touch `config.resolve.extensions`, everything resolves nicely. As soon as I set it to `[".js", ".json"]` the issue comes up. Never mind. Adding `".mjs"` before `".js"` resolved that

issue: Hey all — when webpack takes an existing module and ... "transforms" it so it uses webpack's `require` — what is that process called? e.g. when I run `webpack --verbose`, I get output like 
solution: 

issue: I'm not sure if this makes sense, but does Webpack do something to the "file scope" of a file? Although this the closure library doesnt have anything to do w/ webpack, i am getting this error `Closure dependency methods(goog.provide, goog.require, etc) must be called at file scope.` and i dont get it when i compile it manually. So my guess is that Webpack is doing something to the scope and the compiler isn't liking it. thanks 
solution: 

issue: Hello folks. Doing a migration to webpack4 and finding invalidation problems hard to debug. Our bundle gets created over and over again constantly. I've tried adding a hook like `compiler.hooks.invalid.tap`, but it doesn't get triggered. Wondering if there's any way to output additional debug information. 
solution: 

issue: Actually, I tend to build WordPress websites. I’ve used grunt for years, migrated to Gulp about a year ago, and trying to decide if it makes sense to start using Webpack to replace Gulp. Most of the articles I seem to read about webpack are usually geared towards SPA, javascript apps, and React. I want to do all the regular frontend stuff such as sass, uglification, minification, linting, etc…which I know you can do in webpack, just not sure if my use case applies or if it’s more like a square peg in a round hole. 
solution: 

issue: Use CommonsChunkPlugin to create bundles of shared application code between each page. Multi-page applications that reuse a lot of code/modules between entry points can greatly benefit from these techniques, as the amount of entry points increase.   Any examples? Thanks

issue: Hi I would like to import /require a single js file in both front end js and backend js file Im currently using nodejs for the backend Can I make this happne using webpacjk *webpack ? 
solution: 

issue: Hey, I have an issue with webpack 4 and a loader that I'm working on. Previously I was able to append a require in source code like that: https://github.com/kossnocorp/decss-loader/blob/master/preact.js#L4 Previously webpack was resolving and linking the module. Now it's resolved but not linked to the entry point. I can't find any docs about this problem and seems like other loaders don't have it. For example: https://github.com/webpack-contrib/polymer-webpack-loader/blob/master/src/index.js#L143 
solution: 

issue: I am following along with the webpack-demo and when I get to the `Using webpack-dev-middleware` when I run `node server.js` it compiles but in browser I get  Error `Cannot GET /` I copy pasted so is the code missing something? 
solution: 

issue: Yeah, I tried webpack-serve once, and was unable to get a working configuration, so I just went back to WDS. The recommendation is a little bit puzzling /shrug I figured the same. In the end, I decided the perceived benefits of switching were not worth the investment of time and effort it would take to track down the issues and fix my configuration, especially since I already have WDS working pretty well. It seems like WDS is the de-facto standard for serving up a webpack bundle during development. Yup! You can verify yourself, by deleting your `dist` or `build` folder, and running WDS (Last I checked, `dist` directory will not be created)  
solution: 

issue: Oh it never occurred to me that both WDS and serve would both host purely from memory, not from disk! Doh... 
solution: 

issue: Yeah that was exactly what I was doing (under the wrong assumption) to check if either WDS or serve was actually working, hah! Bingo, we're all good now. I'll attempt using `webpack-serve` again to confirm if it actually was working after all. 
solution: 

issue: One option is https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer will give some insight into what modules are in your bundle(s), and what the dependency tree looks like but I dont think it will tell you what paths it's checking, so maybe you should look @  the documentation for that and see if your mental module differs from webpack's resolve aglorithm. https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-resolution/ 
solution: 

issue: so I have an issue with `style-loader`, typescript, and react server-side rendering. If I have an import like `import "../assets/css/base.css";`, webpack will pick it up and compile it, however when trying to render the view on the server-side, I'll get an exception like the following: ```src\assets\css\base.css:1(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) { body {                                                                   ^SyntaxError: Unexpected token {....```If I change it to something like `import style from "../assets/css/base.css";` the view will render but the css won't get compiled.Any way I can have my cake and eat it too?

issue: Is there anybody meet that the `includes` method is not supported in old browser? But it was used in hmr runtime js? 
solution: is there anything new in webpack 4 which I can optimise for http2 connections. I have tried the AggressiveSplitPlugin but had some issues.

issue: I am using file-loader with extract-loader to extract my scss to  css file, this works great and using the webpack-dev-server the hot reaload works with this setup.

issue: Is there no reference to the `mode:` option in the docs? I can't find any. Trying to disable minification when `mode: "production"` 
solution: 

issue: @hal869 thanks, but I'm actually trying to disable the automatic minification happening in webpack 4 without using `mode: development` for my production build mostly because I want to supply both minified and unminified versions of my library 
solution: 

issue: You said you don't want to minify.  That means turning it off. In webpack.config.js.  Which contains options/plugins/etc. So wrap config sections with whatever conditional you want. It runs it automatically because you've accpeted the defaults. Override them. If that's your config, annd you want to conditionally use Uglify -- or any other module/loader/plugin/etc -- I'd strongly suggest starting with a good long read of this: https://survivejs.com/webpack/ Then turn it off. i gave you the link.  IMO. that's the best webpack documenntation out there. ok. then don't read it.

solution: 

issue: @hal869 hmm... strange. I'll add it again and post the error here. 
solution: 

issue: @hal869 Ok, I forgot to add the `root` option. Now, the error isn't showing up, but the reload doesn't happen. The browser console shows the following message:``` The ideia is watching all `.twig` files and when a change occurs the browser should be reloaded. I could migrate all the configurations from gulp+webpack 2 to webpack 4, it's just missing this (reload when twig file changes). 
solution: 

issue: @gil0mendes this works here, specifically _for_ *twig files (in a Symfony4 project)``` plugins: [  new FileWatcherPlugin({   root: './',   files: [    'templates/**/*.twig',   ]  }) ]```any/all saved change to a twig file _are_ immediately picked up. 
solution: 

issue: I finally solved my issue where Webpack 4 was causing a module to be imported incorrectly by changing the import syntax from `const Tooltip = require("rc-tooltip")` to `import Tooltip from "rc-tooltip";`. While I don't know why the former worked under Webpack 1 and not Webpack 4 this alteration fixes my immediate issue. 
solution: 

issue: @Peterabsolon I think that you can within a Plugin:```jscompiler.hooks.compilation.tap('PluginName', compilation => {  compiler.hooks.afterCompile.tap('PluginName', modules => {    // The `modules` contains all the generated modules.  });});``` 
solution: 

issue: Webpack 4 -- need the public path to be altered in production builds so they are prefixed with /static/ 
solution: 

issue: @gil0mendes I can't seem to access those properties. Hooks is undefined under compiler. I'm accessing compiler from the plugin's index.js file```module.exports = function PurifyPlugin(options) {  return {    apply: function apply(compiler) {``` I'm trying to access `css-loader` exports inside this plugin. I'm not sure if "exports" is the right word, I'm trying to access the second argument from its callback. 
solution: 

issue: NODE ENV is coming through undefined. i'm passing --env development as an argument. i get that. ```ReferenceError: mode is not defined``` 
solution: 

issue: I prefer using `NODE_ENV=development` before the command on `package.json` 
solution: 

issue: @brjadams Did you not *define* it? did you DO that? it works here.  pastebin your webpack.*.js 
solution: 

issue: define it using a plugin? 
solution: mode comes through undefined.

issue: Hey guys, is there a way to remove empty modules from the bundle. I get a result similar to this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46611901/webpack-bundle-empty-modules . However it's even worse: upon every build for some reason my entry module is between those empty modules and changes it's position every time I run webpack. Ultimately this invalidates my cache and I would love to prevent that. Also I made a picture of two builds back to back (no changes in config or modules) showcasing the issue: https://imgur.com/a/hbVLL

issue: I'm having some troubles understanding some concepts of webpack. I'm generating my bundle and I use bootstrap, but I don't see anything related to bootstrap in my dist folder. What am I missing? 
solution: 

issue: @DanJourno1_twitter I'm jus trying to understand the concepts. How can I use Bootstrap if my bundler (webpack) won't add any css files to my dist dir (even with the loaders configured for .css files)? 
solution: It seems that when npm runs that command, it just uses 'webpack'. 

issue: After including bootstrap, webpack forgets to bundle jquery together (missing $). If I add jquery as an external, it then misses Poppler. Is this dependency hell? Isn't webpack supposed to include the whole chain? :( @brjadams That is the definition of dependency hell. What if there are 50 dependencies in there? If I add Popper, I get the following error: "Module not found: Error: Recursion in resolving"Webpack can't be this bad. I must be doing something very wrong 
solution: 

issue: I'm not saying it's not .I'm saying it has proven fruitful from what i've read. mayn expose poppler and tether. many* 
solution: 

issue: @gil0mendes where do i do this? why would webpack work when I manually put in ./node_modules/.bin/webpack ..... stuff here, but when npm run build runs that same command, it fails? @gil0mendes and in the module I can still do the normal export syntax? 
solution: 

issue: Is this enough to bundle bootstrap into my app? https://gist.github.com/ivarec/61967be54c4e61a6a7dcc21bb27a249e 
solution: 

issue: I say that, assuming you're using an npm install of the latest boostrap (^4), and want to pull in the .scss compiled stylesheets And I think it behooves you to use scss if possible parcel has some promise, for sure. But that looks close then, if you're not using scss ```        new webpack.ProvidePlugin({            $: "jquery",            jQuery: "jquery",            'window.jQuery': 'jquery',            'window.$': 'jquery'        }),```is what I have, and it works. and my bootstrap dependency is  "bootstrap": "^4.0.0", they are in my bundle. i have the css in a sep bundle 
solution: 

issue: @gil0mendes so I should be setting the export.name etc in those modules? @gil0mendes do you have any idea about my other issue?

I'd also try to skip the flags and put all the config in the actual file to see if something might be clashing there @marcusps11 HMR won't work with the MiniCssPlugin right now it's on its todo list for now just import the css in your script using the dev server weird 
solution:

solution: 

issue: @Chrazy ok cool - also what do you mean by flags? my tech lingo can be lacking 
solution: 

issue: What could possibly be the reason that running `./node_modules/.bin/webpack --env.production` works manually, but if my npm run script does the same thing, it fails???? 
solution: 

issue: @Chrazy if this aimed at me im using 5.4.1 
solution: 

issue: also, if you run "npm ls --depth 0" you should see a warning that you can't use the ExtractTextPlugin anymore 
solution: 

issue: also another question re webpack 4 and autoprefixer?  Is this supported yet does not seem to work for me if i add post-css loader  and a postcss.config file ? 
solution: 

issue: upgrading from webpack 3 to 4 shouldn't have changed anything in regards to postcss just make sure the postcss.config is in the right place see targets here => https://webpack.js.org/concepts/targets/ haven't tried myself, but I guess it depends on what you do in your bundle. If it's very generic stuff I guess there shouldn't be a huge issue. the main thing with node is that it uses Node's require method for imports what version of babel are you using? 
solution: 

issue: @Chrazy weird my postcss.config.js is in same level as webpack.config.js but does not seem to work  ```module.exports = {  plugins: [      require('autoprefixer')  ]}``` ```      {        test: /\.css$/,        use: [          "style-loader", "css-loader", 'postcss-loader'         ]      },``` @Chrazy nope no need that sorted it! thank you 
solution: 

issue: @Chrazy the only issue i'm hitting is with XHR it appears. I added a if (!XMLHttpRequest) { global.XML.. = require(..) } but now webpack fails to build due to Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'child_process' in ./node_modules/XMLHttpRequest/lib'

issue: @idessignflo TBH I'm not sure I understand why that's a syntax error, but at any rate, that code won't do what you want, anyway. If you have a `return` statement and then start your template literal on the next line, ASI will make your `renderFullPage()` function return `undefined`, and your template literal will never be evaluated/returned. @idessignflo a quick example to demonstrate this: http://jsbin.com/noboludece/edit?js,console

issue: @brjadams so you're saying that if you do an `npm run build`, it fails, but when you run the same command as defined in your package.json manually, it works? 
solution: 

issue: @jmar777_twitter if i comment out the require() for this particular file, all is well. NPM and manual runs will build correctly. so I know there is a culprit file, but I have NO idea what. It's a gnarly file I was given.

issue: Can someone give me some feedback on my webpack bundles:http://drops.aranja.com/3I3E0q0J1945 I have a components library on one side, and code splitted routes on the other. Using ES6 I was hoping for each route bundle to tree shake its set of components. It appears that components/src/index.js is built once, with "usedExports" covering the whole project build, not each route bundle.Is tree shaking not the way to go with code splitting? Do I need to manually import each component?

solution: 

issue: I think that means you need babel @watersock That wouldn't help you because it's your code that needs to be transpiled, not a package You need the 'babel-preset-react' package too, do you have it? 
solution: 

issue: @pm64 Interesting, I do already have babel, but it is probably not running against `node_modules`, I will check it out @pm64 Yeah, the `babel-loader` test is skipping `node_modules`.  Nice catch :)  I'm guessing most of the time the library publisher will actually push pre-transpiled components to `npm` so that consumers avoid needing that config? Hmm, babel already runs against my code though

issue: I'm not sure if this was a discussion before, but can webpack redesign itself to run itself and load modules in webworker instead of closure?

issue: You should use precompiled and simply serve the files. This saves a lot CPU and memory 
solution: 

issue: Like compile the SSR part and obtain stats data from a webpack compilated file 
solution: hmm, sounds new to me. So you end up with chunks in your entry file?. 

issue: The reason you encountered this issue is probably not by file size monitoring The code duplication results in an error of sorts? oke So i'm guessing the depending chunk should be offloaded to the common chunks file I'm not sure if you tried looking for a solution of sorts or have already implemented it in webpack But this is where I would start This is probably the issue if not

issue: What does this mean, "module parse failed" when it's trying to load a .d.ts? that doesnt make sense right?
solution: If webpack is running tsc (the Typescript compiler) and it's complaining about a .d.ts, that's weird. If Webpack is saying "I don't have a loader defined for .d.ts files", that means something is trying to require a .d.ts, which should never happen. I've had this problem when people have a broad Context defined, either via require.context(/too-many-files.*\.ts/), or  require("/some/path/" + fileName). Webpack will try to statically analyze the latter statement, and treat (more or less) as require.context(/\/some\/path\/.*/) Either way you wind up with it grabbing .d.ts files when it shouldn't. If you can fix the require / require.context so it excludes the typings, do that. If you can't, add a rule like {test: /\.d\.ts\$/, use: "null-loader"}.

issue: Isn't its doc good enough ? What the issue you have ?

issue: should the module -> rules syntax work with webpack 2.7 (as opposed to version 4) ? because it seems to for me

issue: i have two different scripts that both use 'dataTables', and they collide when loaded due to being bundled together. What's the best way to isolate these issues if bundling?

issue: Oh dang, that's actually really nice because that's all I've needed it for currently... Oof Thanks bunches! 
solution: 

issue: Can i somehow define how webpack looks up a custom loader in `import ... from 'myloader!whatever'`? I'd like to have a .js file in my application's directory that is used for this loader and not write a standalone package. 
solution: 

issue:  @ThiefMaster Check out the docs for `resolveLoader`. You should be able to do something like:```  resolveLoader: {    modules: ['node_modules', path.join(__dirname, '../my-loaders')]  },``` https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolveloader 
solution: 

issue: hrm, seems like my loader never gets called. for testing, i even tried adding it to my rules:```                {                    test: /indico-url:/,                    loader: require('./loaders/indico-url').default,                },```and in one of my .js files I added `import 'indico-url:test';`when running webpack i get `Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'indico-url:test'`

issue: Hi there, I have some example code from restify that I tried to use webpack to bundle. The code runs perfectly fine before bundling. But after bundling I got the following error: `TypeError: n is not a function`. The version of webpack I'm using is 4.5.0 and the version of webpack-cli I'm using is 2.0.14. Here is the code: https://pastebin.com/RKCLPsee. Here is my webpack.config.js: https://pastebin.com/rdGbppu8. here is my package.json: https://pastebin.com/tuDw0S1J 
solution: 

issue: @TheLeePriest_twitter - Yes, I am using Sentry in my webpack build. 
solution: 

issue: Your webpacked code can still assign to the window object.  So if you have a foo function in a module within your bundle, you can, there, set window.foo = foo; I think there's a plugin that automatically exposes globals, too, but I can't remember the name of it off the top of my head.

solution: 

issue: Hi here.I'm having some problem with a complex build that uses typescript.In my tsconfig.json, I only include my main file, `main.ts`. I'd like webpack and/or typescript to "follow" the imports statement to figure out which file to compiles. Currently, it seems that it works like that for the typechecker, but not for the actual compilation.Is there an option to make this work ?

issue: hey @xandris - any reason to not use `babel-polyfill`?

issue: Does anyone know how to fix the 'Cannot find module fs' error? I would like DataTables buttons to work, I'm using webpack encore... 
solution: 

issue: Hello everyone, I'm still using webpack 4.28.4 for organizational reasons. We are trying to transpile some of our code to support ES5 using Babel 7, but our resulting bundle is throwing console errors when loaded in a browser (Chromium v44). We have seen some of the newer options available in webpack 5, which some of my colleagues have been able to use to resolve similar failures:- output.environment.arrowFunction = false - target = 'es5'. Is there some sort of equivalent approach for webpack 4? Do we just need to find the right combination of Babel plugins to fully convert to ES5? The console error we get in Chromium 44 is always an "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token )" in some low level Dojo JavaScript file which we know is unchanged and should be a valid function. Here's a cleaned up version of our webpack.config.js: [<-CODE->]
solution: Did you try to hardcoded it to 44 instead of using babel\_chrome\_level? In Chrome devtools, you might be able to get it to pretty-print the minified Dojo sources to better identify exactly which feature it's tripping over. The better fix for this is to find whatever numbskull in your organization has you stuck on a FIVE YEAR OLD version of a browser and smack them until they stop. Also it looks like you're explicitly excluding dojo from your Babel transform. I don't know much about Dojo -- I guess they made a totally new "modern" version at some point? -- but maybe you can pin to an older version of it that officially supports your version of Chrome?

issue: Does anyone know if its possible/theres a plugin to output all of the "src" files that were consumed in webpack into a new directory. I basically want to output all of the files that we actually used in the codebase for use with static analysis tools that dont play well with transformed code

issue: @mindplay-dk  - if you put `tape` as external, webpack will assume that  the dependency will be available for it when it requires 
solution: 

issue: Yeah and this is what i am doing right now, but the config file is growing so much :/ 
solution: @CarpinatoFabio_twitter can you show me what your config file looks like?. but in real life there is much more code. 

issue: It's not that it's super secret but I do not know if I can share it so I avoid it 
solution: 

issue: ```"scripts": {    "start": "webpack-dev-server --open --config webpack.dev.js",    "build": "webpack --progress --colors --display-error-details --display-cached  --config webpack.prod.js",    "watch": "webpack --watch --progress --colors  --config webpack.dev.js"  },``` 
solution: 

issue: @KyleGalvin - wish I knew more about the RAM usage issue, but as a workaround, is there any reason why you can't build on local and push the bundle to heroku? 
solution: 

issue: maybe it's a caching issue. have you tried reproducing with both `yarn` and `npm`? 
solution: I haven't tried yarn before. I've head good things though. 

issue: haha awesome, sounds promising! yarn is great, but i'm a little skeptical of it sometimes as well since it's an abstraction on top of an abstraction 
solution: 

issue: I didn't install it globally since I want to make sure the build process works on a build machine that I can't install global deps. BTW there is a typo, it should be "node_modules\.bin\webpack-cli.cmd" oh it's not type, Gitter eats a "\" before ".bin" I'm on Windows, "node_modules\\.bin\webpack-cli.cmd" 
solution: 

issue: Thanks. That doesn't change the outcome, though. webpack still don't use less-loader in my project 
solution: 

issue: Is this a bug of webpack, then? But this is such a simple config, if it is a bug, it must have been reported already. Yet I can't find any similar issue on webpack's GitHub issue tracker 
solution: 

issue: Great, at least we ruled out my dev machine issue 
solution: 

issue: I can't, our real project uses less and have like 30 less files I can't imagine webpack doesn't support less 
solution: 

issue: @KyleGalvin thank you! less-loader's doc doesn't say I must "css-loader" and "style-loader" with it. And the error information is definitely not clear 
solution: 

issue: this throws the following error;```html_1  | 07:41:04 server.1    |  const logotype = require('inlineSvg!logotype/logotype.svg')html_1  | 07:41:04 server.1    |                           ^html_1  | 07:41:04 server.1    |  Error: Cannot find module "inlineSvg!logotype/logotype.svg"``` the file is there ok nvm i fixed it i r smark

solution: 

issue: What am I not understanding about `externals` in webpack config? With `target: "node"` and a module in `externals`, shouldn't it just *not* bundle the specified external module and load it via `require()` at run-time? ([Here's my config again](https://gist.github.com/mindplay-dk/fdac59b6207fb5c5b88fa12d21d7f9e8#file-webpack-config-js-L39)).

No matter what and how I export in my entry point, I'm loading the bundle in the browser as [dynamic import](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/11/dynamic-import). But I can't do `module.default()` for example. When I console.log it, it yields `Module{Symbol(Symbol.toStringTag): "Module"}`.

issue: Feel free to any question about splitting If you think you have valid configuration but webpack don't spit your code , try to set `enforce: true` for cache group or set `minSize: 1` and `maxAsyncRequests/maxInitialRequests` to `Infinity` Simple: you have 5 entrypoints and some modules can be in each entrypoints some only in 1 and 2 or 3 and 5 or etc. Set `minChunks: 3` you says webpack split in new chuck only modules what **minimum** in three chucks (example 1,2,4 or 3,4,5).

issue: I'm using dev-middleware and hot-middleware with browsersync. When I change a file it properly rebuilds it, the browser sees that something has changed and tries to load it but gets a 404 from the `hot-update.json`. Any thoughts? I've got `publicPath` set to `/source/` so that is where it looks. However if it is emitted somewhere else I'm not sure where. I've tried `/{hmr json url}`, `__webpack_hmr/{hmr json url}`, among others in the browser directly and they're all not found. I'm using this article as a reference: https://css-tricks.com/combine-webpack-gulp-4/ 
solution: 

issue: Darn, sorry, reading it it seems correct - but I lack experience in this kind of setup - there might be something wrong 
solution: 

issue: Where is your devServer config? are you starting it with `--hot`? I'd check if this file is beging emitted by webpack and after check if it exists in the filesystem 
solution: 

issue: @PomboPedro_twitter thanks for the help. I'll try to translate that to my use case! Any idea if this is a common problem/bug that is being worked on? 
solution: In fact I have no idea what I’m doing. I simply cannot understant webpack documentation about the new  splitChunks  and how it works. Haha, same for me. I feel like a monkey trying all sorts of things. I understand that the common use case is probably better covered with the new api but right now its a pain to things like this.

solution: 

issue: I really struggle to convert a configuration with multiple CommonChunkPlugin to SplitChunkPlugin. I could not find any relevant help in the documentation. I have a two heavy pages with loads of components called 'editor' and 'player' and a multitude of light pages with standard components essentially for input and grid. Accordingly, my webpack 3 configuration consists of an entry per page including 'editor' and 'player' and two CommonChunkPlugin:```const heavyChunkPlugin = new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({    name: 'heavy',    filename: `[name].bundle.js?v=${pkg.version}`,    chunks: ['editor', 'player']});const commonChunkPlugin = new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin({    name: 'common',    filename: `[name].bundle.js?v=${pkg.version}`,    chunks: ['heavy', 'page1', 'page2', 'page3', 'page4', 'page5', ...],    minChunks: 2});```I load `common.bundle.js` on all pages and `heavy.bundle.js` only on the 'editor' and 'player' with the additional required components. Any ideas regarding the recommended webpack 4 config with SplitChunkPlugin? @AlexSchwabauer, try https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack?at=5ad8d9b4109bb04332dd19c9

solution: I think the issue I ran into was specific to Windows, is that the environment you're building from?.

issue: Would the commit changes help? https://github.com/webpack/webpack/compare/v3.10.0...v3.11.0 
solution: 

issue: @rowild You don't need a concatenation plugin when you use the dependency graph to annotate your dependencies. Webpack automatically bundles things up for you 
solution: 

issue: Hi, can somone tell me how i can dynamicly load chunkfiles. Because the setted global variable window.__webpack_public_path__ = 'some-url' in the index.html seems not to work for me window.__webpack_public_path__  i mean the underscores get removed from gitter 
solution: 

issue: @rowild If you don't have `require()`able/`import()`able modules to begin with, Webpack will be somewhat of a chore to set up. The simplest setup using modules that don't need to be transpiled (eg. with Babel) don't even need any configuration as of Webpack 4. The thing is Webpack is not just a module concatenator, it's a smart bundler that can do a lot more. Also, re the ugliness of the bundle, if you run in production mode ( `--mode=production`), you won't get useless comments or `eval()`s, those are just there to help you develop 
solution: 

issue: Yeah, I think it's universally acknowledged that the documentation could use some love. For migrating from 3 to 4, I've found that a decent way is to remove everything non-essential (I consider `babel-loader` config essential) from your config and rework from there to whatever point you need. 
solution: 

issue: @no-more change your target to node in the config 
solution: then id recommend starting with a very small hello world demo and then inspect the bundle to see what it generated, identify where your main entry was placed, and work from there to troubleshoot. 

issue: here's what my output file looks like if my input file is `console.log("test")`:```var ac_main =exports.ids = [0];exports.modules = [/* 0 *//***/ (function(module, exports) {console.log("test");/***/ })];;//# sourceMappingURL=main.map``` 
solution: odd. it should resemble something like this: https://github.com/jlongster/backend-with-webpack/tree/part1. 

issue: The example you've provided is for webpack 1, do you think it can work with webpack 3 ? Yes but I don't understand why. I don't see any big difference between my config and the one provided that could explain it I'll try to simplify even more my config and post it here 
solution: 

issue: I'm using ```import()``` for dynamic importing, but it always fails Can I couple the dynamic import with the aliasing setup in my webpack.config? Or is that what is causing it to fail? 
solution: 

issue: hello. is anyone using svg sprites? i have issues getting it to work through the <use> tag. f.e. ```<svg><use href="../assets/fa-regular.svg#bars"/></svg>``` i'm always getting a 404 for the according svg file apparently the "#" is the problem ...but i can't get it to work

issue: Hi guys. Good night.how can I setup a http port to my environment?I'm using version 1.16.5 of webpack-dev-server 
solution: 

issue: @grantm If you click "Edit document" in the top right-hand corner, you can propose updates to the text. If you're incorrect, they'll tell you, and if not, you've just contributed to Webpack :) 
solution: 

issue: webpack4 often generates modules starting with the comment `/*! no static exports found */`. Is this a warning and what does it actually mean? 
solution: 

issue: @ShanonJackson yes, ofc it has :D. It looks like webpack is not even touching the URL 
solution: 

issue: hi, used an old version of webpack 1.14.0 with (ejected create-react-app). Now I have updated my create-react-app and ejected and therefor new version of webpack + other libs (webpack version 3.8.1). I can't access process.env anymore, any ideas? never mind.. found issue.. 
solution: 

issue: Are the aliases are supposed to work with dynamic import ? 
solution: 

issue: I am looking into https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/#dynamic-imports trying to switch some of my node_modules to be dynamically loaded so I can code split them properly but I can't figure out how I can convert something like : ```import moment from 'moment';``` I tried ```// other relevant code here  return import('moment').then((moment) => {    moment(value).format(shortDateFormat);  });``` 
solution: 

issue: I did not :) I tried const moment = () => import('moment') (from my https://router.vuejs.org/en/advanced/lazy-loading.html examples) but @steve_dalonzo_twitter , Syntax Error: await is a reserved word (5:15) I actually did try it :) yeah so it cant go on top of my script as before I dont get the mechanics of this

issue: should there be any problem bunding something that was already bundled with webpack? clarification... I want to bundle some external code with my code and that external code was bundled with webpack.  should it work OK, in general? 
solution: 

issue: Webpack is duplicating my modules I've tried --optimize-dedupe but it has no effect it seems 
solution: 

issue: I am using Angular 5 and webpack. I try to load components/modules dynamically. As soon as I bundle my app, I cannot load them anymore.My webpack.config.js ```module.exports = {    output: {        filename: "./out.js"    },    entry: "./src/main.js",}```my component that loads modules dynamically: ```@Component({    selector: 'my-app',    template: '<button (click)="load()">load</button>',})export class AppComponent {    constructor(private loader: SystemJsNgModuleLoader) {    }    load() {        new Promise((resolve, reject) => {            this.loader.load("./dyn")                .then();        });    }} ```and the error message I got: `out.js:51 ERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): Error: Cannot find module "./dyn".`Before bundling my app does a webrequest and loads ./dyn.js. After bundling it does not do any webrequest.I guess Webpack changes the behavior of my SystemJsNgModuleLoader. How can I go round this? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I just moved to Webpack 4.x I am setting several     splitChunks.cacheGroups , but the "name" option is not honoured . I am just getting 1.js , 2.js 3.js etc etc. for example```        lodash: {          test: /[\\/]lodash[\\/]/,          minSize: 100,          reuseExistingChunk: true,          name: true,        },``` doesn't generate lodash[hash].js I mean my output is     filename: utils.assetsPath('js/[name].[chunkhash:3].js'), but why [name] is just a number 
solution: 

issue: right.. I was trying every form of importing, etc :) @tommck likes "foo" a bit too much, apparently thanks for the help @akx I'm at least getting something exported now.. might help me with my larger problem

issue: ah, thanks for this, but i actually had a nice working solution with webpack 2. with webpack 4, though, i can't use CommonsChunkPlugin, so I was asking explicitly about `splitChunks` i wonder if i can use the above with a `vendor` array entry, but then have the `vendor` `cacheGroup` override it. i think the docs said it would then be treated like a chunk?

issue: @DanielRuf I'm using Rollup inside my app and the watcher lets me use chokidar. The docs say install chokidar yourself. I did, added it to my package.json and even tried requiring it from within that api module just because. For some reason it can't find chokidar. However, I'm going to build a more complex watcher anyway now since chokidar doesn't do exactly what I'm hoping it would do.

issue: Does anyone know how to  find out why my bundle is so massive even with UglifyJsPlugin Clearly UglifyJsPlugin doesnt feel it can optimize it more 
solution: 

issue: I'm using `config.optimization.splitChunks = {chunks: "all"}`, which generally works fine.   Every so often, webpack claims to have emitted a chunk, when there's no sign of that chunk on disk.  It's listed in my stats.json (provided by webpack-stats-plugin), and in webpack's STDOUT, but the chunk is missing It's generating all my other chunks as normal.  Restarting webpack doesn't seem to help.   Whenever it's occurred previously, I've nuked my entire docker container and the problem goes away for a bit There doesn't seem to be a pattern as to which chunk it affects, I'm just occasionally missing a random chunk :/ Anyone ran into this?   I've been going slightly crazy with my failures to debug it 
solution: 

issue: Hey all, I'm trying to figure something out with imports and exports with webpack 4 + babel-loader.

solution: 

issue: Afternoon folks.  I feel almost dumb having to ask, but how do I access the configuration documentation for webpack 3?  Doesn't seem to be a way to switch which version of the docs you're looking at on the webpack site. Or if you want to answer what I'm trying to find, that'd work just as well.  Basically, I'm going to have two separately maintained webpack bundles on my site, and I'm pretty sure in that case there's an output property I'm supposed to have so that one bundle's jsonp function doesn't overwrite the other's (or something like that) I'm just not sure what the property is, or how it's supposed to be configured 
solution: 

issue: would anyone happen to know why i could have a development build and production build that works locally, but on my server, only the development build works but not production build? im on webpack 4.8.3 i get a bunch of undefined property js errors on the production build on server. i feel like it has to do with the transpiling..

issue: @Rokibul630 Webpack is the latest and greatest in front-end development tools. It is a module bundler that works great with the most modern of front-end workflows including Babel, ReactJS, CommonJS, among others 
solution: 

issue: @DanielRuf I took over mostly the things from your webpack-scss project, but adapted to webpack 4 with minicssextractplugin. Only focussing on SASS->CSS for now. My output `theme.css` file is empty though. Input `theme.scss` is this:```@import "node_modules/bootstrap/scss/functions";@import "node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";@import "node_modules/bootstrap/scss/mixins";``` The filtering works, but is very non-intuitive for newbies... 
solution: 

issue: @DanielRuf my bad. The three imports from my `theme.scss` are reusable sass things, but render to no css. When e.g. adding `~bootstrap/sass/_nav`, I get the bootstrap nav stuff in my rendered `theme.css`. 
solution: 

issue: The [name] is only available in the webpack config json, not in other mrthods like path.resolve (at least not in this way). webpack is a js bundler so you have to change the desired path in the mini css extract plugin with `filename`or in the loaders (not in this case). 
solution:

issue: Hi all, I've run into an issue with the SplitChunksPlugin (Webpack v4): I have an entrypoint called `common.js` which simply `import`s and configures Sentry's Raven client (error tracking). I've also configured this entrypoint as a `cacheGroup` within the `optimize.splitChunks` section. It all works as expected, _except_ that any code initially contained within `common.js` _does not execute_. I can see that the code is included, it just doesn't run. Is this the expected behaviour? From the [SplitChunksPlugin documentation](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/split-chunks-plugin/#naming) I can see that if an entrypoint and a `cacheGroup` have the same name, the entrypoint is removed. But there's no information regarding what happens to the code that's in the entrypoint. Any help or information would be greatly appreciated! 
solution: 

issue: @Biuni seems like Webpack might have an issue with the (cache busting?) query string, which you wouldn't need if you used `[hash]` in the `options.name`. If you remove the `?t=1501841394106`, does it work?

solution: 

issue: @QuantumInformation you've misunderstood me, you need to use `loader: ''` _or_ `use: []`, not both e.g. 
solution: 

issue: like this?```      {        test: /\.(jpg|png|svg)$/,        loader: 'url-loader',        options: {          limit: 25000,          include: PATHS.src + 'images'        }        // An array of paths or an individual path      }``` 
solution: 

issue: ```      {        test: /\.(jpg|png|svg)$/,        include: PATHS.src + "images",        use: [          {            loader: "url-loader",            options: {              limit: 25000            }          }        ]      }``` Let me know if that works. Docs are really good on this: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/ @Biuni it could be that they're trying to prevent you from using this 'legacy' version of cache busting – I'm not sure.

solution: 

issue: Hello, I'm in the process of (incrementally) upgrading an AngularJS app that previously used Gulp and Browserify. I was thinking of trying to replace Browserify with Webpack, does anyone know of any good resources/starter templates for something like this? I found https://github.com/dsebastien/angularjs-webpack-starter, which uses Webpack but not Gulp. 
solution: 

issue: Which gets compiled and passed to webpack as:```javascriptexport var logger = function () {    var args = [];    for (var _i = 0; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {        args[_i] = arguments[_i];    }    console.log.apply(console, args);};//# sourceMappingURL=logger.js.map``` So I don’t get that “referenced with single entry” thing here... There are also other similar wargnings that say: "referenced with import()" and many others that read as “ModuleConcatenation bailout: Module is not an ECMAScript module” (I’m using delegated dll-references) 
solution: 

issue: webpack-serve is stripping a script tag from my index.html file?? problem was webpack-serve automatically serving root folder index.html... 
solution: Because script type module forces use strict. So you can't use any sloppy JS libs which is most of them. 

issue: Hello guys, I'm following the tutorial on getting started but when running `$ npx webpack` it is not creating a `bundle.js` file for me, instead it is creating a `main.js` file on the `/dist` folder. Anything I could be missing? Currently there is no config file or anything. 
solution: 

issue: hey, I'm having issues with proxyTable and cors. I have a backend dev server on :8080 and I've set up the "changeOrigin:true" flag.  I actually get a response from the backend but chrome always complains about No Access Control Allow Origin I think I'm missing something basic here

solution: 

issue: so no help on this issue? 
solution: 

issue: why are you guys not helping me with my bundle problm? don't know why webpack can't see my bundle file 
solution: 

issue: @connelevalsam You posted some code and then said nothing about what you're doing that's generating the problem. 
solution: 

issue: Hih, is the ExtendedAPIPlugin available in v4? I can't figure that out in the docs, since it's missing in the plugin list, but the deprecated commonschunkplugin is still in the list 
solution: 

issue: cool thanks! I’m gonna dig more into it thanks It should be simple but It’s giving me headaches lol haha I don’t really use html in the app I am developing , basically It’s JS and It need to load and perform really well , I am giving a go to webpack 4 to see if I can reduce the bundle size and split even more my code 
solution: I had already code spliting and dynamic imports, the main purpose is to reduce bundle size and decrease bundling time as well.

solution: 

issue: As per the error, you are not using correct loader. Are you importing css into js files and not using css-loader in webpack config?? 
solution: 

issue: and probably url-loader also for google font urls inside the css

solution: 

issue: Hello, What's the best way in WP 4.x to call a function only when the files included/watched match a extension, to me it's a loader vs a compiler hook. Thoughts? 
solution: 

issue: I'm trying to upgrade a large project from webpack 3 -> 4, however, no matter what I do I keep getting blocked by `constants-browserify`. i have updated webpack and all associated tooling, loaders, and plugins. i've create a super simple stripped down webpack config but it keeps returning an error about a missing package and never gets to compilation: https://gist.github.com/ryanerato/a149934aa169d0af584032960384985e 
solution: 

issue: @ctaylo21 the best strategy there, imho, would be don't use a second entry point. instead, use a dynamic import (`import()`) https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/#dynamic-imports in the callback/promise resolution/however you are running your async code

issue: @appsolutegeek , I had the same problem, 2 days ago. Check my solution, above. TL;DR you only need to add `index: '/index.html',` to historyOptions 
solution: 

issue: Hi devs, I have `src` and `node_modules` folders that when running webpack produces one main.js, which is super nice. It is possible to output a `src` folder that is linked up to a single file containing all the node_module stuff? I want this because I'm uploading my zipped sources to our gaming platform called Riddles.io where we provide an online IDE. This is my webpack config: https://github.com/riddlesio/cryptotrader-ccxt-starterbot-javascript/blob/master/webpack.config.js

solution: 

issue: not work at all! 
solution: 

issue: hi guys ,  when i download webpack (npm install --save-dev webpack) i have an issue "npm ERR! write after end" how to fix this problem please any ideas ? 
solution: 

issue: I’ve been using web pack https://github.com/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin but It miss the dynamic imports as now the chunks are part of the optimization instead of CommonChunksPlugin where I can pipe into other plugins ( manifest plugin in this case) (correct me if I’m wrong) so It creates the manifest.json but only with the initial chunks not with the dynamic imports really?, so I’m doing something wrong :( because the chunks are generated properly but when I use the manifestplugin it only has the initial chunks but not the dynamic imports 
solution: 

issue: @MilosRasic https://github.com/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin/blob/master/lib/plugin.js#L78 I’m not really sure about If only works with initial chunks 
solution: 

issue: After the update to webpack 4, an `umd` library output  uses `window` instead of `this` for root. Any way to prevent this, as this wont work in a node environment? 
solution: 

issue: @jefe-spain  As I said I'm not familiar with it and can't remember where it goes, I just know it exists because I've seen it. Google it around 
solution: I know I know thanks, but I think that’s for loaders. I’m trying to apply a plugin after chunk optimizations. 

issue: @jefe-spain Ok i'm not that familiar with the manifest stuff so I can't really visualize what you want to do sorry 
solution: no worries mate thanks anyway!! :). 

issue: @jefe-spain you're looking for cacheGroups, those are roughly equivalent to an instance of old CommonsChunkPlugin. They have a test property which does exactly what minChunks function used to do. 
solution: 

issue: OK, i know that’s a strange problem, did you use two webpack config file? or do something like this? [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/webpack/webpack/Qyx9/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/webpack/webpack/Qyx9/image.png) 
solution: 

issue: In my mind it should be something wrong in your plugin config. @ryan15091991 
solution: 

issue: problem here is that is for up front setting of process vars i.e you know them at compile time these vars are set at runtime as its run in electron, it needs to know where electron is running and append some other config related guff (platform specific) stuff after it hence the `someDynamicVariable` bit 
solution: 

issue: While I was trying to find answers I tried an AWFUL hack around where I did an `eval` which set the env args, and to some extent that worked, BUT as one of the vars contains paths it seemed to garble them i.e `c:\\something\\blah\\node\\` would get garbled to `c:\somethinglahode` as it would read the `\b` and `\n` as the chars for some reason so am at the point where I thought I would see if there was a way to stop webpack altering my code 
solution: 

issue: So anything I can do? as it seems even the `eval` workaround is just a trick, its not actually setting the process.env from what I can tell, just pretends it is Also is there a good reason why webpack alters code using `process.env`? 
solution: 

issue: hello guys, I just ported my app to webpack 4 but I can’t see any further reduction in my bundle is there anything I could look up to reduce my bundle size? 
solution: 

issue: So i downloaded the updated version, when webpack has been added cos the frontend is mithril and the backend is golang now trying to run it on my go server it serves everything but webpack complains about not seeing my bundle.js file so what do i do? 
solution: 

issue: @jefe-spain no, publicpath will have to start after your URL/address if /var/www/html is your web root directory, and html/index.html and html/webpack.config.js exists, then using '/' as your publicpath will work (it's relative to the webpack config file) 
solution: 

issue: Does anyone have any pointers on how to get runtime environment variables to be read by / injected into a webpack bundle that's served in one container and built in another? 
solution: 

issue: Hello, all. I am ahving problem with ```javascript resolve: {    alias: {      '../../theme.config': path.join(__dirname, 'theme/theme.config')    }  },```  I am getting error: ```@import (multiple) '../../theme.config';^Can't resolve '../../theme.config' in ‘/xxxxxxx/node_modules/semantic-ui-less/definitions/modules’``` I am not sure how to debug `resolve` in configuration well, originally I had `’../../theme.config$’: path.join` and it didn’t work, then I tried to remove ‘$' 
solution: 

issue: @oivindoh does https://webpack.js.org/plugins/define-plugin/ work for you? 
solution: 

issue: @MilosRasic I wish.. the use-case here is making the application behave differently based on environment from the server hosting it without having to have one version compiled per server/config - the bundle itself is built elsewhere e.g. identical docker image for dozens of service frontends configurable via container environment 
solution: 

issue: there are of course some inter-team politics keeping me from just putting a placeholder strings in there and running a little search/replace script on container startup as well,  just to make life more fun :) 
solution: 

issue: @MilosRasic , I have a question about getting webpack to work with `karma-webpack` - specifically for an existing project that uses `karma-browserify` Or, if there's anywhere to get help with specific questions, I'd appreciate a nudge in the right direction 
solution: 

issue: I am using webpack 4.6 and I am having trouble with the publicPath. It is not being used as I expected to prepend my images.  publicPath: '/foo', I expect /foo/myimage.png but I get /myimage.png with no transformation.  Any help would be appreciated.

solution: 

issue: hi everyone, apologies for the beginner question, i'm trying to serve an angular project via https with webpack-dev-server, I've added the --https flag but my browser doesn't trust the certificate, what steps am I missing? 
solution: 

issue: but as appose to me compiling my library files and then serving them from `public/assets` I guess DllPlugin lets webpack-dev-server serve the files still anyone have luck with `hard-source-webpack-plugin` AND `webpack-dev-server`? The caching drastically improved my re-build time, but also drastically SLOWED my dev-server incremental builds 
solution: 

issue: Thanks for the link, I'm just starting to question if I should stay with what I have been for 20 years or if I need to evolve to something else. My actual programming skill is in my opinion not that great. I am amazing at finding bugs and fixing them, but the actual art of creation takes me what I feel is super long compared to other developers because I'm a perfectionist and if I run into an issue in development I want to roll back and start again at that point and it causes a lot of issues for me @wes-r 
solution: If you're trying to setup a new project and are thus exploring webpack, I'd try and find a tutorial or a starter pack for the stack you want.

issue: Hi guys I just started using webpack, what I want to do is supposedly simple I do not know if it's applicable or not.So I want to make a list of html files convert all its CSS classes into inline-css, but I can't even make webpack just move the files from `src` to `dist`here is my config so far```jsconst path = require('path');const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');const config = {  entry: {    "visitor-email": __dirname + '/src/visitor-email.html',    "media-email": __dirname + '/src/media-email.html',  },  output: {    filename: '[name].inline.html',    path: __dirname + '/dist'  },  plugins: [new HtmlWebpackPlugin()]}module.exports = config;``` 
solution: 

issue: i know how to copy assets and load them in run-time dynamically using absolute paths which get loaded from the public path but what if i am not using a web server and would like to open my bundle HTML directly from local file system (i.e. file://path/to/bundle.html)? because i am using absolute paths they are resolved in this case from file:///asset.ext and not relative to file://path/to/asset.ext what do you suggest in this case? 
solution: 

issue: i started with a boiler plate for es6  and sass, now that i want to add another html file it's not accessible via dev server and not included in my build. how do i go about getting webpack to see it?

solution: 

issue: I'm looking for some help on chunking in webpack 4. I'm generating js/css assets to be inserted manually in a perl-based website, using the following```jsoptimization: {  splitChunks: {     cacheGroups: {    commons: {     name: 'commons',     test: /\.js$/,                    chunks: "all",                    minChunks: 1                },    styles: {     name: 'styles',     test: /\.css$/,     chunks: 'all',     enforce: true    }     }  }, },```But depending on the `--mode`, in development it generates a `commons.js`, but in production mode it doesn't. Naturally, if I'm inserting these js files manually into perl-oriented HTML, I need to know definitively what js files are going to be output by webpack. Is there some way of configuring the chunking to work how I want? with the chunking above, it always generates `commons.js` in both dev and prod mode, but the bulk of my real code appears in commons.js and my only other entry point contains some kind of automatically generated code I don't understand.

issue: The approach I decided on was to use the webpack-html-plugin and use a custom template that passes extra options to the template and using `<% if (...) %>` statements 
solution: . 

issue: What is your current `root` setting? 
solution: hmm.. don't have one. should be resolve.root?. 

issue: I set that to my "src" folder and fixed a couple other things that were src/ and still got the same problem.. can't find the png file 
solution: The root setting is an option of the html-loader.. yeah.. I tried that a bunch of times, nothing I did even made a difference. 

issue: HI guys Kind of new to webpack I am wondering about support for IE8 since I just started a new job and it seems a real chaos with gulp, grunt task and configirations. we need to support this specific browser version, so I wanna know if you recommend to me to do so o maybe just stay with grunt/gulp any comments in this topic would be appreciate I am aware that webpack does not suport IE8, but if any has come with a workaround it will be awesome 
solution: 

issue: And specifically when using `webpack-command`...Ok I'll open an issue. 
solution: 

issue: I have a library `MyLib` that I am loading inside `MyApp`. Both are compiled with webpack 4 and `MyApp` uses `source-map-loader` to load the sourcemaps for `MyLib`.  As of webpack 4 the sourcemaps point to a minified file instead of the original source code. `devtool` is set to `source-map`—this used to work with webpack 2. What changed—or rather what do I need to change to get this to work again? 
solution: 

issue: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/7540 is here anyone from core who could re review my PR? :) 
solution: 

issue: nvm.  tried it multiple times with the same result, even after upgrading npm from 4 to 6.  then switched to a different folder, and it installed fine.  then back to the original folder, and it finally worked there, too.  \\_(ツ)_/

issue: @JON_D84_twitter Well... I wonder, what would you need if you were trying to debug that error? 
solution: 

issue: Sorry, that is where I have been trying different tests, the escape still doesnt work 
solution: have you double checked to make sure you have all loaders, presets, plugins, etc. installed?. 

issue: npm install babel-loader babel-core babel-preset-env webpack babel loader ReadME - for version 7.x of babel loader and webpack 3.x suggests those npm packages I don't see "babel-preset-env" package in your package.json Not sure if needed, but just something I noticed

issue: right now my HMR is not working fine neither any change is reflecting. Any help appreciated. here is my webpack code https://pastebin.com/gSxsUc5H 
solution: 

issue: @scriptify Thanks Maximilian @sunnynegi are you using Yarn or npm ? 
solution: Yarn. 

issue: This seems to be a fairly common issue (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47076926/webpack-multiple-css-outputs-with-extracttext) but I can't seem to track down a solution -> Webpack 2 with multiple entrypoints, importing  some shared CSS framework components that get imported via resolved aliases, and using ExtractTextPlugin to extract the SASS into a CSS file for each entrypoint . If I add an additional entrypoint, it seems like the shared CSS gets included in the last entrypoint's CSS file, and is no longer included  in the earlier entrypoints, causing things not to be styled properly.

solution: 

issue: throw new Error("Module '" + loader.path + "' is not a loader (must have normal or pitch function)");   after the command npm run dev webpack 4 throws this error bhai hain koi 
solution: 

issue: @tommck yeah, libraries expose unminified code as "main" and "module" fields in package.json and this is what's loaded by webpack. angular.min.js is probably for uses who don't use bundlers.

solution: @Mooli88 a quick google search will definitely give you that answer. try webpack-serve.

issue: @Mooli88 I think you're looking for https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#using-webpack-dev-server 
solution: @avilapedro WDS is in maintenance only mode, and has been for some time. webpack-serve is now recommended. 

issue: I got webpack-serve to work but when try to go the server URL it says Not Found Is that normal? Also do you need a publicPath in webpack? for this to work? @jasonbiondo  I think it's just one spot that's what I did  optimization: {  splitChunks: {   chunks: 'all'  } } in your module.exports @DBosley  yeah I had the same problem too.  Happens if you're using json-loader, etc. Lots of stuff is no longer being used if you upgraded to webpack 4 
solution: 

issue: @shellscape   when I run webpack-serve everything seems to be okay but when I go the server URI it says  File Not Found.  Do I have to do an extra step? @DBosley   Try to do a straight webpack build, it will have more info

issue: @dbschwartz I did see that this appears:` wdm: Hash: 75e352f6b1689659e142` it seems to indicate that there was a problem with the hash generation the weird thing is I don't use the hash anywhere in my config for dev 
solution: 

issue: @shellscape Hey there! I keep seeing your name when I'm looking into my issues. Do you have any idea why I'd get "ERROR in" with no output and a red X on the `Hash:` line of wdm output? 
solution: 

issue: @DBosley I get that has problem as well, I think that's by default.  Try to run webpack-serve --log-level trace that should give you a verbose log 
solution: 

issue: I may have found the issue not sure though. Still testing Realized I was using a plugin that hasn't been updated in 2 years flow-status-webpack-plugin yeah, this started after the upgrade it's just annoying there were no real useful logs I've recompiled 30 times now, no issue :D

issue: I'm now wondering if having these jquery 'imports' in multiple places in the . webpack.config.js files is an issue react/node Im using a create react app to test that my package that uses this webpack is working @shellscape

issue: @sandren I'm not sure about plain JS but for other preprocessors you have to specify a loader, and then import the bits you need in app.js to access them. For your sass you would have to at least import your variables file in every file to access them. Has anyone here ever tried to load web-components with webpack? Use case: I'm writing Elm and want to import a package via a web-component (leaflet-maps) as it avoids the fight over virtual dom elements but you're not in a package

issue: Is it possible to exclude a json file from the webpack bundle? I've got a NoSQL db imported in javascript that will change on run-time. Now I have to re-build the webpack bundle everytime it changes the db. I know I could use ajax to solve this problem but i'd rather use javascript for better performance. I've tried `externals: ['./../db.json'],` or ```{  test: /\.json$/,  exclude: resolve('db.json')}```Neither works. I can get it to exclude from the webpack bundle but then I can't use it. When I import it it will say that its contents are '/db.json' instead of the actual json 
solution: 

issue: @GijsGoudzwaard well, yeah, if you don't include something in the bundle then you can't use it in runtime. You either have to include it in the bundle or fetch it at runtime.

issue: @arkadyt anything that's been tagged with "bug"  or another tag like "Web Assembly". anything not tagged or tagged with "answer required" or "needs more information" hasn't been confirmed/triaged

solution: 

issue: @arkadyt not necessarily. the bar seems quite high for getting a PR merged though. I stick to github.com/webpack-contrib as I like the development processes in place much better in that org, and that's where most of the plugins and utilities for webpack live that the community uses all of the repos/projects that I maintain for webpack are in that org

Guys, does anybody have a luck to work with "*.d.ts" files?//globals.d.ts```declare module 'my-module' {    class SomeClass {        static foo(a: string): void    }    export = SomeClass;}```//MyComponent.vue``` import bar = require('my-module');....bar.foo("baz");Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'my-module' in ...```//tsconfig.json```{    "compilerOptions": {        "outDir": "./built/",        "sourceMap": true,        "strict": true,        "noImplicitReturns": true,        "module": "amd",        "moduleResolution": "node",        "target": "es5",        "experimentalDecorators": true,        "strictPropertyInitialization": false    },    "include": [        "./web/**/*"    ]}```Any ideas?_ 
solution: 

issue: @raymank26 My guess is that typescript just wants your declaration file included when compiling the MyComponent.vue file. Is the declaration file included in the typescript compiling process, i.e. included as a triple-slash reference comment like /// <reference path="../relative/path/to/globals.d.ts" /> ? I'm not sure if the triple-slash is a good approach or not, but in case including the declaration file using tsconfig 'typeRoots' property doesn't work for some reason, it's an easy way to do it.

solution: 

issue: hmm... is that standard for cli tools? I totally agree that passing an option explicitly would override other config, but less convinced that a preset should. I guess I have never experience this exact issue before with cli tools, so I could just be in the dark here.

solution: 

issue: @DBosley there's no capability for that at the moment, but I'd recommend opening a new issue on webpack-dev-middleware asking for that 
solution: 

issue: @bschwartz757 webpack-dev-server uses express. koa can use express middleware. you're going to run into the same thing. 
solution: If I KNEW it actually i'll do it by myself. @bschwartz757 if you use webpack-dev-server you're going to be working on a stack that's barely maintained. FYI. @sumaya99 that sounds like homework. 

issue: The steps you listed are extremely basic and should be simple to research. The webpack project gitter chat is for discussing the webpack project, not for asking for general github help 
solution: so what there's no where to go and ask :(. There are plenty of places to go and ask, this is just not one of them.

issue: Hi guys, anyone can point me some links here I can find information to inject the output bundlers with webpack-serve? With `webpack-dev-server` it automatically injected all bundlers automatically, but that doesn't happen with `webpack-serve` I noticed that if I use paths like this `/main.js` (being  `main` an entry point) the file is loaded... not injected Any ideas?! 
solution: 

issue: Automatically add the script on the head when accessing the dev server 
solution: so if im understanding correctly, you want to "inject" some  js file to your existing bundle only when webpack dev server is running?. 

issue: My goal is replacing `webpack-dev-server` by `webpack-serve` I already have all configured except this. On the `webpack-dev-server` it uses `webpack-dev-middleware` to serve the files emitted by Webpack... `webpack-serve` can't do that right?!

issue: @sujeetbuddiga why can't you make a module for your GA script and add it to your bundle?  just add the GA script to a local js file like ga.js and include it in a top-level bundle? there's nothing special about the GA script that needs to be written directly to the page I suppose you can put the ga script directly on your html templates, you might not even need the html plugin to do that

issue: @jmptr oh interesting, yes this is the part i was missing.  so the typical webpack usage is to have it output html files?  when using with a framework like django would you normally write some code to read these html files and in my case extract the script tags? 
solution: @hekevintran you could use webpack to output a template (html fragment) you can maybe use in django. 

issue: @jmptr  Well, my problem is I downloaded a project and when I do 'npm run dev' , I get errors like 'Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './app/images/placeholder.png' in 'C:\Users\zfore\Documents\jsProject\app\javascripts\components\application\list'' @jmptr even though the file is there.

issue: Hi everyone,I have problem switch from Webpack 3 to Webpack 4 and `CommonsChunkPlugin`. So, I’m trying to solve it with `splitChunks` but I’m getting errors.Situation is this:* I need to have 2 common chunk entrypoints, "bootstrap" and "core"* Both entrypoints need to have some explicit dependecies shared among other entrypoints* "bootstrap" is first loaded entrypoint, then "core" and then page specific entrypoint. They need to be loaded sequentially (blocking scripts)* Dependencies are shared with cascade, so dependencies defined in "bootstrap" shouldn’t be repeated in "core" (they should be referenced from "bootstrap")* "bootstrap" entrypoint should have Webpack runtime codeWhat I’ve managed to do is require runtime code only in "bootstrap" entrypoint with following configuration:```jsoptimization: { runtimeChunk: {  name: () => 'bootstrap' }}```But that’s all I’ve managed. Dependencies are still not shared between two vendor chunks (let’s call them that).When I introduce `splitChunks`, everything breaks down (and it worked with `CommonsChunkPlugin`).What I’ve seen is that somehow dependencies inside "bootstrap" entrypoint run asynchronously.Take this for example:```html<script src="bootstrap.js"></script><script> window.globalMethodFromBootstrap();</script>```This throws error where browser says it can’t find called method, and this worked with `CommonsChunkPlugin`. I thought modules would be loaded exactly at the time they were defined as was the case with Webpack 3.Am I doing something wrong? I’ve tried every related example from Webpack `examples` folder but it didn’t help.

issue: hello, i'm new to webpack. i'm wondering how I can use webpack-dev-server along with nodemon (to run/watch the server code). the app works perfectly when i use webpack to build the entire software system (the server and the front-end), but i can't get the development server to work, specifically, i don't know how to get the routes in my server code to work in a development environment so i've been forced to use webpack --watch & nodemon server.js i think webpack should be able to watch the server code too, so i wouldn't need to use nodemon

solution: 

issue: > @cybermerlin no I am using `String.isString()`.oh, that's easy (mb :-) )```plugins: [   new webpack.ProvidePlugin({      "String": "@string/isstring"//OR      "String.isString": "@string/isstring"``` 
solution: mb   `"String.isString" : "@string/isstring"`  play with it. I want it to be automatically pulled when I require the library which has that dependency.. 

issue: tried it, doesn't work either 
solution: 

issue: > `string: './src/isstring'` that cannot be correct it needs to be String.isString and an npm module would `'String.isString': '@string/isstring'` work? 
solution: 

issue: @cybermerlin does the ouput need to match the main of the package.json? 
solution: so Id need to add a main property or just overwrite the current index.js.

issue: i am using webpack in angular but when run project it make lot of chunk file its taking lot of response time .plz any help 
solution: 

issue: Not really sure if this is a Truffle or Webpack question but here goes. I started truffle with the webpack example and been working from there. Everything has been going well, have a couple of contracts running and and a webpage up. However, I want to now run with multiple js and html files. Looks like the solution lies with using HtmlWebpackPlugin in the webpack.config.js file. I haven't really looked into that file yet and more I look at it the more confuse I get :)  First of all I can't seem to find my app.js file which I have been using so far. I was in the build directory at init, but after I deleted it, it never comes back and I can't find it anywhere, but my html page has been working. I also having problems specifying the location of my html file when I'm using the HtmlWebpackPlugin, I'm getting a entry point not found when running (npm run dev). So I must be missing something very basic. Anyone have any ideas? 
solution: 

issue: hmm it looks like I needed rm node_modules to fix it... 
solution: 

issue: @jmptr Been trying that, but I can't seem to be able to specify the right path to the file. That's  when I started to look for my app.js file but couldn't find it.pushed my latest webconfig.js file so you can see how I'm trying to do it. 
solution: 

issue: I'm getting a weird issue where webpack can't find a package that has been included in my project. It's a loader that the v8-cache says it can't find. 
solution: 

issue: @jmptr will look into that. Little bit easier to see what's going on when I can at least see my files. So HtmlWebpackPlugin is generating a html page now which points to my js file. The path seems to be correct, but when I am trying to run I am getting: Entrypoint undefined = ./app/index.html. Does this mean it can't find my html file or my js file maybe? @jmptr no worries about the last one. seems to just be a warning, strange but just a warning. Can live with that for now :)Thanks for your help!

solution: require uses resolver to find out what actually file/files should be required. Because of it you need to use some resolver hook for your case.

issue: Hey everyone, I have been developing a cli tool distrubuted as an npm package. I can do something like `npm run build` and that will use the webpack configuration file that is in the npm library. I keep on getting module resolution errors from webpack complaining it can't resolve 'babel-loader', 'scss-loader', etc from the project. Is there a way I can fix the path where these modules try to get resolved from? Am I even doing this correctly? I am trying to do something similar to the Angular CLI tool, but obviously to a much less degree.

solution: 

issue: Hello everyone!

solution: 

issue: I don't suppose you've tried `const img404 = require('../../assets/img/404-error.svg')` ? 
solution: 

issue: Since your error is showing `<?xml ...` it would suggest to me that at runtime it fails to find the file at that path. Resulting in an XML file being loaded instead. 
solution: hmm, but webpack is supposed to find that file itself right according to the webpack config?.

issue: Hey guys, I've been having a problem with the use of  `npm link ` in one of my VueJS projects.In my `packages.json` I've got a github repo as a dependency which is perfectly working in my local environment. The thing is when I try to use this dependency as a local one. I do this with `npm link` but it's giving me the following error: `Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'vue-loader/node_modules/vue-style-loader'`. I believe it has something to do with my webpack config but I'm not sure where to start. Does anyone know what am I missing here?

issue: @adeelibr thank for your replying but i cant find any clue in your article about merging plugins options, Do i miss something? so the answer is we can't do what I am looking for, right? 
solution: 

issue: The entire article I have written uses webpack-merge to divide your configurations into chunks. 
solution: So in short, if you have a plugin in common.js and when you merge it with prod.js configurations, in the order you merge it in will take precedence. Check this answer out. This will help https://github.com/survivejs/webpack-merge/issues/29#issuecomment-260272995. 

issue: let me show my case```//common.js  plugins: [    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({      template: 'index.html'    })  ]//prod.js  plugins: [    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({      minify: {        html5: true      }    })  ]  //expected  plugins: [    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({      template: 'index.html',      minify: {        html5: true      }    })  ]``` so i need to repeat it in dev and prod?

solution: 

issue: I have an application.css file. It's recognized by webpack. It has a few @import lines to merge together some scss files. Whichever @import is on the first line is inlined into the resulting packs/application.css file while the others retain their original @import syntax. I assume I'm doing something wrong here but I'm unsure whether it's my undertstanding of webpack imports or if I've simply misconfigured webpack. Any suggestions on the best next step to determine where I'm making my mistake?

solution: 

issue: @ShanonJackson I have. No matter what I set that to it does not seem to resolve this issue. Currently my output.chunkFilename = '[name].js' for dev and '[name].[chunkhash:8].js' for prod. 
solution: So for example if several entry files load React, then the resulting path seems to have all of the chunk names in that path in some random order.. 

issue: Yeah, that's true.. and I'm not manually accessing any of the names anyway (using a manifest file for entry => asset resolution), so this isn't really critical. It's just not ideal. I'd prefer to just name the files with some internal ID so they are shorter when included in each page.

issue: actually i wonder if its babel 7 that changed this behavior 
solution: 

issue: I found out my issue was actually a fault in my own code, but not sure why it didnt break on me in older versions. likely related to changes to classes in babel. 
solution: 

issue: It's official because it was created by the webpack guys. Size does not mean this is not official.

solution: I mean I can see it being generated in the dev server: https://cl.ly/0338f942779c. 

issue: im not too familiar with this, but this is basically just webpack runtime no? i would assume webpack creates it as needed are you facing a particular issue that happens because the file is missing? if you really need the file for something its possible: https://survivejs.com/webpack/optimizing/separating-manifest/ https://webpack.js.org/concepts/manifest/ 
solution: 

issue: From the tutorial it seems like there are to different files with these names Well I'm new to this so I thought everything should work just like in the tutorial but if it doesn't really matter then everything's fine Thank you very much for your help :) 
solution: 

issue: well, just adding `optimization: {runtimeChunk: 'single'}` should cause the build to separate the runtime from your code bundle and vendor bundle but im not sure about the logic behind that, but if you're a beginner i wouldnt worry too much about it, if your hashes constantly change even though you didnt change the content then maybe check this again

solution: 

issue: @brendan-rice why not just use it like any other pkg? https://www.npmjs.com/package/webslides @arihantverma `be able to access the the filename ` what do you mean by that? 
solution: 

issue: No, not the orifi No, not the original file names. 1.js ( global ls ) + 2.js ( globals ) + 3.js ( globals ) => something.[hash].js ( all globals intact ). 
solution: 

issue: dont really see why you'd use webpack though, the point of module bundlers is to, well, have a module system in the browser, no? you can just use node to read all files from the js dir, concat them to one string, run babel and minify over the string, hash the result, write the result to a new file with filename = hash 
solution: 

issue: if you have multiple scripts trying to register conflicting globals, your in a world of pain and need to try to resolve that issue. not something webpack can even solve but if your wanting to export some globals, just do window.foo = foo; in your entry point sorry i misread your statement that you had a conflict, but im taking it you meant you WANT 1 file to read another files globals 
solution: 

issue: Yes files have references to other files' globals hence @aikar @trassmann `webpack-concat-plugin` i wss habvomg *i was having a couple of issues with it, forgot what they were  . Will tell as soon as I get to my laptop

issue: Can I dynamically add a chunk containing JSON that's constructed at build time? 
solution: 

issue: yaymukund are you on webpack 3? split chunk was removed in 4 err sorry ignore me i had that totally backwards not enough caffeine yet 
solution: 

issue: I have a question about webpack 4 I am doing a dynamic import - import('../component'); However, this component is compiled to the directory:assets/js/portal As a result, my code can't find the chunked file because it is looking for it on the server with the path'../0.chunk.js'How do I get webpack to look in the 'assets/js/portal' for the chunk. 
solution: 

issue: @trassmann , I did a simple webpack 1.15.0 setup just to check if this is not a custom build error. It throws error in the simple setup as well. It seems that `webpack-concat-plugin` doesn't support 1.15.0 webpack anymore.

issue: hello! i'm seeing an issue where:* i have two bundles* each is included by a separate HTML page* in dev mode, using webpack-dev-server, one bundle works just fine and connects to the websocket. the other bundle is served correctly but doesn't connect to the websocket, and therefore doesn't live-reload. in fact, it doesn't even include the   !*** (webpack)-hot-client/client/socket.js ***! header, so it looks like the websocket code is just not being included at alli realize this is probably a PITA to debug but hoping to get lucky if this a known issue with a simple fix

solution: 

issue: Do you have a package JSON? 
solution: Well it’s hard when you have a generic problem that could have tons of different catalysts. 

issue: my local repo matched origin, i just had to restart lmfao so many dickheads out there :D go eat your watermelon /ignore @trassmann how do i block you, kid @codymikol https://bpaste.net/show/8a738bff6b77 im quite humble, you started being a prick right from the jump. look in the mirror. `most likely the problem is in front of the screen` its not a fact just stop participating 
solution: 

issue: i dont have the statistics but i would argue that most code problems stem from the person writing the code 
solution: 

issue: the question was very openended because i dont know where to draw the focus. I dont have any experience with webpack I thought I pinpointed i believe my issue is with webpack.provideplugin but that's all i wanted to pollute the chat with. more wuld be provided upon request. shh 
solution: 

issue: what would be reasons for not externalizing all the npm libraries instead of bundle them up ? I am planing to externalize npm packages so that It can speed up webpack build time and I would really appreciate if I can get some input on why not externalize libraries. 
solution: 

issue: Anyone? Any pointers as to where I can actually start to debug this? 
solution: 

issue: @jancama2 dev server serves files from memory not from filesystem AFAIK, so a filesystem change probably doesnt affect the dev servers memory you can manually react to filesystem changes by running your dev server through webpack API youd probably have to invalidate the dev servers memory somehow but im just speculating check the API here: https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware 
solution: 

issue: I asked this same question (as above) in the angular-cli room, and the node.js room, and they all say to come here to ask. Does no one have any tips on where I can even begin to debug this issue? 
solution: 

issue: @danwellman maybe some sort of memory leak? some function that continually pushes stuff to memory in a loop or something? play with the dev tools audit/performance maybe you can identify heavy functions [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/webpack/webpack/Qz0k/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/webpack/webpack/Qz0k/image.png) [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/webpack/webpack/CJgR/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/webpack/webpack/CJgR/image.png) 
solution: np, I did not provide full information in original post. I am used to debugging in browser, but not terminal :). 

issue: i dont know :/ i am also just speculating, i dont know whats really going wrong https://github.com/lloyd/node-memwatch this seems pretty cool https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/11/tracking-down-memory-leaks-in-node-js-a-node-js-holiday-season/ all kinda old though best of luck

issue: Hey guys, does anyone have working knowledge of the webpack manifest plugin?

solution: 

issue: Thank guys.. It was a DI error solved 
solution: 

issue: Is there a webpack-native-way of looking up the path of an entrypoint (eg "homepage" => "split.9812309810928.js"), or do I need to parse the output of something like webpack-stats-plugin ? I think I want the result of jsonpScriptSrc, but that's not exposed anywhere AFAICT 
solution: 

issue: oh in my webpack config I have this line:```optimization: { minimizer: [ getTerser() ] }```doesn't it disable the uglify plugin? I thought only the minimizers listed here will be run also, when I have `mangle.properties = false` in that config then things works fine, so maybe uglify js is already disabled.. yes thank you. It's good to hear that. I'll try to reproduce 
solution: 

issue: Can you try to reproduce problem with `terser` CLI, if yes you should create issue in their repo, because if it is bug in terser we can't do anything on our side 
solution: 

issue: Yeah but I really need the property mangle.. it reduces our bundle size almost 50%. I'll try with the CLI when I got hone 
solution: 

issue: mangle properties are not safe in many many cases better avoid this or you need to adding new properties when you add new library/framework/etc It is safe only when all code use `import`/`export` and you don't need access to properties/methods in global scope But a lot of libraries use CJS and so it is real unsafe 
solution: 

issue: You can move some libraries to own chunk and use `exclude` option for this chunk 
solution: not sure if it's a right thing but I do expect Terser won't mangle external properties..```const aaaa = require("aaaa")aaaa.doSomething({ bbbb: 1 })```but may be it's difficult for Terser to figure out. 

issue: @TestSubject06 hm I'm not sure.. I've never touch that.. you can see my config at https://github.com/dvkndn/scalajs-code-splitting/blob/master/webpack.config.js

issue: Hi everyone, I need some feedback from you on what you expect the next version of webpack-cli to be. https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli/issues/699 any feedback is great :) @Binero native is hard to do in browser, because it is no filesystem. You are only relative to the repository you are in, SSR is another way if you want to use webpack with native modules yes Answered, a simple google search can help you out as well

issue: Hi, I am having issue with webpack. node_modules/A is importing a .css, I use node_modules/A in node_modules/B, I am in project C. When I try to run webpack, it tells me that the css is having a Synthax error, Invalid or unexpected token. Any idea how i can solve this? 
solution: 

issue: Huh… then I don’t know where the error is, sorry. The error you showed clearly shows that the CSS is not being parsed at all - its just processed, so the loaders are not applied. So… i have no idea why. 
solution: 

issue: @kopax is this only happening for external css from third party modules, or are you also unable to import your own css?

issue: Can someone take a look at this issue? https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/issues/877 I've some working solutions but still need an explanation of why those work ! Thanks in advance. 
solution: 

issue: If I'm developing locally, I have my /src/index.html grabbing my src/index.js.. but when I build, how do I change it to grab dist/index.js instead? Why does Webpack assume I won't be using my own index.html file that I need recompiled and minified into dist? 
solution: well, usually people also bundle their code when developing locally, so it's rather rare that you would have the js bundle in two different places relative to the index.html. 

issue: perhaps I'm not explaining or understanding properly I have my src/index.html which I write myself, and the only thing it grabs is index.js (which has my styles, my js, etc).  They all live in the src folder. All I'm trying to achieve is to build my code and have it ready to go when I upload to my server (for a personal website) So if my index.html that I wrote myself, bundles to dist, it's going to have the wrote script path cause it's set to src/index.js instead of dist/index.js but I can't develop in dist... because everyone suggests the cleanwebpackplugin which I agree is a good thing

issue: Hello, just thinking about moving over from Gulp to Webpack.  One thing that buggers me and I can't find the answer is, how to minify images without referencing them in any of the JS files (something that gulp takes care easily as it is running in node file system). 
solution: 

issue: Morning folks.  Can anyone tell me what the correct way to modify require.context behaviour from a plugin is?  Currently https://gist.github.com/NicholasRoge/7fa3dc97035733db6360390a594f0cdc is what I'm doing and it works well enough but it seems wrong to monkeypatch like I'm doing.  On top of that, it has another issue in that only the first fallback directory's dependencies are tracked, it seems.  Modifying a file in one of the tail fallback directories doesn't cause webpack to recompile. 
solution: 

issue: @Michal__ko_twitter Have you read about loaders? you can use a loader to say how you are going to "process" a specific filegroup like "png + jpg" or just "js".For files the loader normally is "url-loader" or "file-loader", the first one transforms the image into base64 and the second one loads the file separately (like a normal file request).For minimization you can use https://github.com/vanwagonet/img-loader alongside url-loader or file-loader (your project's preference) @Michal__ko_twitter This img-loader will work together with the other loader.

solution: for example, the chunk name was originally `24-chunk.js`, but I want it to load `24-chunk-h2ab36f.js`. 

issue: right, but the issue is that particular hash is not known until after webpack compile time so i'm assuming webpack calls a function to actually start loading said chunks and if so, I could monkey patch that to intercept the loading

issue: Hi folks - recently upgraded from 3 > 4 and now minimising is breaking 3rd party code. i.ebefore```import {window} from 'service' // abstractionwindow.foo = window.foo || {}window.foo.bar = foo.section // foo implicitly on window...```after minification```var o; = // windowvar n; // scope variable declared...var foo = o.foo || {};o.foo.bar = n.section // TypeError! cannot read section of undefined - should be o.foo.section```the only way to get this to stop happening is to pass `compress: false` to Terser in the webpack optimize options. Anyone got any tips on tuning the build to prevent the introduction of this local variable?

issue: Your plugin definition is incorrect. plugins: [    // Provides jQuery for other JS bundled with Webpack    new webpack.ProvidePlugin({      $: 'jquery',      jQuery: 'jquery',      jquery: 'jquery',      “window.$”,”jquery”, “window.jQuery”:”jquery”    })  ] If you add the “window.$” portion it will fix it. I just had this issue yesterday and this worked. I have a typo on this. So please don’t copy verbatim. Hard to write code on mobile. :h 
solution: 

issue: I'm having a similar issue to the above, but I have no errors in the console. I just don't get the correct thing when I load my application. 
solution: 

issue: I'm banging my head against a wall at the moment, because I can't see anything that is wrong, but at the same time I'm not super familiar with Webpack. 
solution: 

issue: The issue is that their app selector page is still a web page. Chromes entire platform is a web app. Maybe I’m wrong. I just want to see the document about it. Interesting. That would break many apps. The issue the other person is experiencing is due to them not exposing jquery on “window.$” 
solution: 

issue: i did't found any about.but spent something about 3 hours struggling with `webpack always exposes a jquery as globals`and then i realized that its not a jquery 
solution: 

issue: and your suggestion i think is possible workaround```import $ from 'jquery'window.$ = $```do not remember is there a special plugin or option for this i am usually trying to achive opposite thing - no globals in prod app @trassmann  i've suppose something similar, but just do not try to searchthx 
solution: 

issue: ```Note: This API is only available from within the console itself. You cannot access the Command Line API from scripts on the page.``` so it shouldnt interfere with your globals 
solution: 

issue: ah, i thought you were trying to build dunno then did you check how other plugins do it? https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/3b6d1495c3858d59cfdb46b2343c07f2e4c1316d/lib/DllReferencePlugin.js#L126 maybe you're pushing too late?

Is it possible to execute the code in the loader?I mean:Suppose I export:```import {colors} from 'something';export default `h1 { color: ${ colors.red } }````Is it possible for me to get the exported and evaluated string in the loader? So that I can do something like this so that I can give it as input to style-loader/ css-loader? oh, I have never used prepack. Let me check it once. Thanks for the leads :) @kevinsimper I checked, there is a plugin for it but not a loader for me to chain. Also, it seems prepack depends on webpack to resolve dependency where as the loader level we do not have dependency resolved. As, the file content comes only as a string. 
solution: @ajaymathur Hmm, okay, but prepack seems to do exactly that, it evalutes and returns the final output https://prepack.io/.

The image's source for the injected html refers to the app's root directory. Presumably, this is not the correct behavior. What should I do? 
solution: 

issue: anyone know if it's possible to define a resolve alias as `alias: {"@/": resolve('src')}`? `alias: {"@": resolve('src')}` works, but it also catches things like `@babel/core` in my node_modules folder, so I basically want to add `/` to be more specific 
solution: 

issue: @chdsbd Why not use an IIFE? Grab the list of folders in `src` and return an object of that? This should do. Its a bit verbose, but would work around `@`-scoped modules.

issue: Does anyone know how I might be able to make webpack chunks optional (weak dependencies) via webpack configuration? I'm trying to codesplit locale files that are required with an expression (eg `require(``locales/${locale}``)` type require). I can code split them just fine. But then webpack expects *all* the locales to be loaded before the main app entrypoint executes, otherwise it will fail since it can't locate all of the locales, ofcoruse, I only want to have to load one.

solution: 

issue: @vaughnkoch Did you try setting your `Content-type` to something marking it as unicode, like `;charset=utf8`? Also this is more of a Chrome bug at most instead of Webpack. @conversatiate_twitter Did you report to the developers of `ts-loader`? Maybe they aren’t handling exceptions in the intended way, or the loader is not properly compatible with webpack 4?

issue: Hi there! Trying this thing finally. In the very [begginning](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/#creating-a-bundle) I follow step by step and when running `npx webpack` I get an error, where it complains of not being able to resolve './src' even though the src folder is right there. Tried from within the src folder just in case, same error Ok. It has to exactly be "index.js", not any other name like "main.js". I think that should be **clearly stated** in the docs Because "ERROR in Entry module not found: Error: Can't resolve './src' in '/Users/user/STUFF/Code/Tests/TerminalVelocity'" doesn't help troubleshooting

issue: Question if someone would.I split on the routes/controllers of my application```import( /* webpackChunkName: "controller/[request]" */ `./controller/${route[0]}`);```For example the file `controller/About.js` route would be `/about` resolver returns `About`. The problem is I'm getting a type error: ```TypeError: "modules[moduleId] is undefined"```Anyone have an idea why that would be?

issue: Hey guys, I'm running a Typescript Webpack build - and it's taking close to 5 minutes to build with three entry points. I tried profiling the build with the webpack built-in profile plugin - but the file it produces is too large to use in anything that reads it. So because I can't really profile the build, I don't really know where all the time is being spent. How should I go about profiling the build?

issue: Hello everyone !I have a NativeScript app with Vue.js and webpack handling bundling. Here is the thing: NativeScript environment does not have the global `process` variable. I try to integrate tensorflow.js into that stack which calls `process.hrtime` which, as I said, is not available in NativeScript. After building my project I get `[TypeError: process.hrtime is not a function]` at runtime. That being said, I try to shim `process.hrtime` with webpack, here is what I tried so far:```// webpack.config.jsconst process = require('./globals.js');... // other configs        plugins: [            new webpack.ProvidePlugin({                process: 'process'             }),    ... // other configs``` where `./globals.js` exports a `process` object like :```// globals.jsvar process = {    hrtime: function(){        // hrtime logic here    }}module.exports = process;``` But I still get the same error Any thoughts ? Hey @trassmann thanks for your reply. I just tried live, I get a weird error `Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './globals.js' in '/src/nativescript-vue-tfjs/node_modules/@tensorflow/tfjs-data/dist'` I don't know why it is trying to get `.globals.js` into `@tensorflow/tfjs-data`

issue: How do I tell Webpack 4 to shim `require('fs')` for the browser? I don't want to ignore `fs` or replace it with a stub, I have my own working shim and want a third-party Node library that uses `fs` to use my shim in the browser. 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys I have an issue with webpack only with the test config : Module build failed: SyntaxError: 'import' and 'export' may only appear at the top level (5:0) 
solution: 

issue: @stevenvachon Close, but not quite it. I'm bundling a third-party module which calls `require('fs')`, and I want Webpack to provide it with my own `fs` implementation (which I also want to bundle, so maybe `externals` won't work?). I'm looking at `resolve.alias` but can't get it to work. @sagarika432 Well, predominantly JavaScript https://github.com/webpack/webpack

issue: However I'm working on an old project that's in angularjs and there are lot of node dependencies that I'm gonna need for front-end builds don't wanna make 100+ requests to node_modules for things that I don't need yes sorry, its for staging and dev env yeah I mean web requests 
solution: 

issue: I've seen configs where node_modules are excluded in the module rules and then they resolve the path to `node_modules` kinda throws me off That was just some examples that I looked at 
solution: 

issue: How can I split my application with webpack and react-router and not have my view blink on page change ? no, just react-router 
solution: 

issue: @taburetkin thanks for the reply. So `module.exports.output.path` tells webpack where to put the css? 
solution: no, it tells where your bundle's root isthen you tell that js should be placed at 'dist/..' (this is relative to bundle root)and css will be at the root because there is no special setup for it. i see. i guess that makes sense because webpack doesn't do css out of the box. What throws me is that under `output` there is `path` and `filename` but path is also being used as the output css directory..

solution: 

issue: @daKmoR that's what i'm using: karma-webpack 
solution: 

issue: ah my bad seems to work with env as well: https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-polyfill/ you need to have `@babel/polyfill` installed though even if you dont specify in any config 
solution: 

issue: Well, of course I have `@babel/polyfill`. But preset-env documentation is stating that I need only to install it and don't import in my sources 
solution: right. it only fails for String.startsWith that's happen to be in fbjs module. 

issue: Is it possible that useBuiltIns: "usage" only parses my own code, but not node_modules? 
solution: 

issue: @deAtog  Not sure I understand. 
solution: 

issue: @RobertShaw1 For example, adding the following external: {'jquery' : 'jQuery'} tells Webpack to exclude the jquery script from the bundle, but adds a slim 'jquery' module which looks for and returns window.jQuery. If window.jQuery is not defined when the wrapper is ran, an error is generated. 
solution: 

issue: @lerayne > Is it possible that useBuiltIns: "usage" only parses my own code, but not node_modules?`exclude: /node_modules/` - exclude this rule from this loader 
solution: 

issue: @stevenvachon 5.x alpha - beware that it's a pretty big rewrite (mostly by me - so I am biased) Reason being that certain issues (I think like the one you are having) could not be solved otherwise 
solution: 

issue: issue with steps to reproduce (best a repo) would be needed did never encounter that error so I can't say what the reason could be 
solution: 

issue: @stevenvachon reasonable, Steven! Thanks! As this is custdev before building MVP, I can't show the product itself so far. So want to talk about problem in general, not my solution. The product, though, seems to be like online lectures with top notch content. 
solution: 

issue: @lerayne  the problem with "usage" is that it only pollyfills based on the modules that babel actually sees.. I suspect the error you are seeing is coming from a node library that you have told Babel not to process.. 
solution: 

issue: Hi gang, we are trying to use webpack to process a Javascript file with Babel and output it (without putting it in html) but it seems to break and not work that way, is this by design? If so how do we get around this? 
solution: 

issue: @daKmoR i couldn't get it to work with apply-loader -- it ran the module function but nothing happened... any advice? 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I'm using TerserPlugin for minifying and to prevent function names from being minified, I set` keep_fnames: true` and now my minimizer looks like this```new TerserPlugin({          cache: true,          parallel: true,          terserOptions: {            keep_fnames: true          }        })```Although this worked for chrome, unfortunately it did not work for Edge. The only way I got it to work was by doing this```new TerserPlugin({          cache: true,          parallel: true,          terserOptions: {            keep_fnames: true            compress: false          }        })```So I figured that maybe for compression I also needed to set `keep_fnames: true` there as well but that wasn't the case. Why does setting compress false works when I've already told Terser to not minify function names?

solution: 

issue: Hi all, anyone know of a module that will modify the HTML in my footer/header templates and add a hash to the script src tag etc, all i can find are modules that rename my files by adding a hash into the filename? Thanks Basically this https://github.com/shakyShane/grunt-cache-breaker, for Webpack 
solution: @Shiroe, it works well with every es6 syntax; arrow functions, for eg.. 

issue: As you can see though (due to the large project behind and many other dependencies) we are still on Webpack 2.6 and im starting to get a better sense in order to upgrade to Webpack 4 so its better if you find a way to make it work in Webpack 4 
solution: Yes, i mainly use es6 wherever i can (arrow-functions, spread operators etc..).

issue: after some research i understand why in this build (and in any common build with less-loader) some styles repeated multiple timeshttps://repl.it/@taburetkin/webpack-less-exampleas i understand the logic is simplewhen webpack meet `import 'xxx.less` this less file is compiled to cssand i wonder is it possible (maybe with custom loader/or plugin) change this strategyi believe, that in case of less its better to not compile each less file but just concatenate itand make compile once in the end of bundle processthere will not be any dublications in this case and less->css will be called once

issue: Hey folks. I'm working on a Webpack plugin that generates a CSS file. I've successfully gotten it to output the file but what I'd love it to do is include it in the full pipeline of CSS processing so that it would get, say, minified or auto-prefixed. I feel like I'm probably just hooking into the wrong part of the process or outputting the file into the filesystem rather than into a chunk or something, but can't quite figure out what to do. You can see where I'm doing this here https://github.com/kilmc/battery-webpack-plugin/blob/master/src/plugin.js#L35 . Any help at all would be super appreciated. Thank you!

issue: I'm having difficulty figuring out why the MiniCssExtractPlugin is emitting CSS files for two pages on my site, and one page loads its styles fine, but the other does not.

issue: My plugin setup is as follows: ```new MiniCssExtractPlugin({    filename: env.production ? '[name].[hash].css' : '[name].css',    chunkFilename: env.production ? '[id].[hash].css' : '[id].css' ,    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),    publicPath: '/assets/js/dist/'})``` I noticed that the emitted filename for the css that works uses a number, whereas the one that does not work uses the name of the entry js file. Perhaps this is a clue.

issue: Awesome :) So I need to modify a project for my company. This is programmed with webpack. What I need to do is to create a dropdown with dynamic amount of options.

solution: 

issue: if you remove "MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader" from module: {        rules: [            {                test: /\.(sa|sc|c)ss$/,                use: [                    MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader, // extracting css into separate files for production only                    'css-loader', // translates CSS into CommonJS                    'postcss-loader', // processes CSS before adding to page (used for autoprefixer)                    'sass-loader' // compiles Sass to CSS, using Node Sass by default                ]            }        ]}the css will be injected into the build  js which will then inject it into the page on load. did you add the  MiniC you were talking about a change. did you add MiniCssExtractPlugin last ? sorry only guessing here too. joined the channel as i am not a pro in webpack and having problems myself with a build ;-) 
solution: if you remove the extract plugin the css will be included however not via a linked css but rather injected trough the js file. 

issue: No probs. I'll keep looking myself. If any other config gurus out there have a spare couple of minutes I'd appreciate it. Spent the last hour or two yesterday pulling my hair out!! The css isn't actually added to the dist folder either. 
solution: 

issue: I'm using https://webpack.js.org/plugins/mini-css-extract-plugin to extract the css.The changes I made yesterday between it working and not working that I can think of were to add in aliases (see bottom of common config). I've reverted these back but this doesn't fix my issue. The other thing I did was to move my js files into a js folder in src/.I'm not getting any errors so my styles.scss file (imported into js/index.js) is getting found. It's just not copying a css version of this file over to dist.

In all other modules we only imported jQueryAll good so far, in v4 I've been playing with configurations and nothing works for me, basically what happens is that in another entry file I get error because migrate seems not to be loaded, I do not want to import migrate in all modules, I just need that jQuery + jQuery  Migrate load together wherever I import jQuery, ideas?

issue: @alexander-schranz I presume that flow is a peer dependency in that local library? If so, you'll need to use npm link to link flow in the library to flow in your project folder. I just ran into this same issue myself and it is caused by webpack looking for node_modules required by the library your are importing in the library's folder and not the project folder you are bundling.  Sadly this is a cost of using local libraries. 
solution: 

issue: @deAtog damn in my case link is no option as in this the devs always need todo themself to +12 links and they are basically no JS devs. The libraries are local dependencies as they are installed over another package manager as the package is only to 5% JS and just need to match with the other none js code.

solution: 

issue: @robertmain The usual approach is to have all javascript in webpack scope, including the partsthat call these utilities. Then all renaming is self encapsulated. If you can't do that and need to maintain a public API I wouldn't say webpack is necessarily your best bet

issue: Basically, I'm refactoring an old wordpress plugin's creaky JavaScript.

I'm trying to clean that up with webpack I haven't gotten that far yet 
solution: 

issue: It doesn't seem like a lot of code. Are you sure you can't just load it all in a non-blocking manner and call it a day? Some of the code uses modern javascript features, so you might even have ES module loading available 
solution: Probably fix that `for (let ... in ...)` pattern then. https://github.com/WP-for-Church/Sermon-Manager/blob/dev/assets/js/plyr.js#L17.

solution: 

issue: One way could be going really old school. Include your dependency as a script tag with `defer` in the template that generates the dom the script is working on. 
solution: @Munter by "your dependency" do you mean the js that weback outputs? or do you mean the dependencies of that?.

issue: Having an issue in a project where I have multiple webpack projects with their own configuration, but I want to share code between them. What seems to be happening is possibly some collision with the other webpack configs. Is there a way to prevent this from happening? @IngwiePhoenix so I don't want to share the config, just some of the code. Building a gist... https://gist.github.com/ajsharp/5ee4a2ca9ba5ed4398c7a9b830e64889 So, when I go try to build for production, if i wipe out the root project's node_modules folder, the subproject can't find deps defined in it's package.json such as react maybe this is an issue with going outside webpack's root folder? @IngwiePhoenix I have the deps in the subproject -- that's the part of the behavior i don't understand the subproject has react in it's package.json, but for some reason, files included outside it's tree don't use the subproject's external deps / node_modules So, if i remove all the import's of files outside the subproject tree, the project builds fine, webpack finds react in the subproject's node_modules folder, etc but if i bring in a react component from the parent tree, it can't find react and any other external module referenced in those files ah, i figured it out

issue: Hello, I am trying to bundle a nodejs application with webpack. I have the main code which should be bundled and I have a seperate folder with plugins which should be able to be deployed individually. So the ideal would be to get a  main-bundle, a modules-bundle containing the shared dependencies, and a bundle for each plugin containing only the non shared dependencies (and the plugin code itself). I know it is kind of an unsual and complex scenario. However maybe there is a solution at least to something close. I tried different approaches using mainly the output.library* options, but didn't got anything to work properly. Thanks...

issue: Hello! I have a small questions about Webpack Node Watcher source, since in [there](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/8a7597aa6eb2eef66a8f9db3a0c49bcb96022a94/lib/node/NodeWatchFileSystem.js#L14) the `aggregateTimeout` parameter is set to 0 but in [Watchpack constructor](https://github.com/webpack/watchpack/blob/9e8152b850a2492cb27f624e8a898ea23fde199f/lib/watchpack.js#L25) the `aggregateTimeout` is set to 200 if falsy, what's the point of setting this parameter to 0 and can't this bring some issues?

issue: Hey guys, I'm using the `NormalModuleReplacementPlugin` to replace a native dependency imported by a js module. I got it to work, but not in the way I would like to.  What I'm doing right now (it works):```new NormalModuleReplacementPlugin(regex, resource => {    resource.request = desiredPath;    resource.dependencies[0].request = desiredPath;});```What I would like to do (but I can't get it to work):```new NormalModuleReplacementPlugin(regex, desiredPath);```I'm using webpack `3.2.0`. Am doing something wrong and/or have I misunderstood something? I'm totally positive that the regex matches the module name. 
solution: 

issue: hey folks,  does webpack has any mechanism to store some data on the built environment ??? for example i want store some flags regarding the build it self, but i want to have it alongside my bundle 
solution: @lxsameer If I understand you correctly, you can do that with `DefinePlugin`, which you can use to define environment variables that will be available in your runtime. That way you can calculate your build information while bundling and have it available for your runtime.. no that wasn't what i mean. so lets see it in this way, i want to store some flags on a file (either on fs or on webpack cache in memory) and change their value before the build start and after the build has been finished..

issue: Hello. I have two modules, `main` and `dep`. `main` imports function from `dep` and calls `module.hot.accept('./dep.js');`. And all is fine, except when I add `module.hot.accept();` to `dep` module. Example: https://gist.github.com/Rulexec/c3aca12196668e3bc2d6eee988ebab22If I pass callback to `module.hot.accept('./dep.js', ...);`, it is not called, if `dep` contains `module.hot.accept();`. Some debugging shows, that in this case `dep.js` is not outdated dependency and import in `main` points to old `dep` module.I can't understand, this is expected behaviour or bug. I should never make self-accepted modules?

solution: 

issue: It depends what you are doing in each individual JS file. If parts of it are interacting, like if you are calling a function from one file in another file, then you should rewrite it such that the file with the function has a module.exports = function() {} for that function or something along those lines, then the other file that needs that function would require() it at the top of the file. But if some files are doing their own separate things like interacting with the DOM but not interacting with each other, it is good enough to just require them from the entry of your app. Unless these files are highly dependent on one another (eg. there are global variables that they are all using) it shouldn't be too hard to reuse what you have

issue: Hey guys, I'm trying to switch from Parceljs to webpack, because in Parcel I cant use es7 and leave the constructors out of JSX, but I just cant get webpack working... its missing module 'acorn' and 'html-webpack-plugin' but I have never seen them in the dependencies of other projects, so for that reason I dont want to install them explicitly, I'm thinking something else is causing this issue?

solution: 

issue: I managed to resolve the 'acorn' and 'html-webpack-plugin' issue... Seems that I was using old packages. I'm baffled how many versions it is of babel that do not support each other...

solution: 

issue: good day, I migrated from webpack 3 to webpack 4, and all good except my CSS is no longer working. I switched to MiniCssExtractPlugin of course, however, I debugged and found that right now my chunks of css are not included in my `styles.css` file, like it was before. When I remove chunks at all , i see `styles.css` is filled with my styles, but if a leave chunks, it's almost empty. I see that I generate chunks like `[id].style.css`, which works as expected, but in webpack 3 they still bundled into one file `styles.css`. My config is below ```{    optimization: {      splitChunks: {        name: 'bootstrap',        minChunks: Infinity,        cacheGroups: {          bootstrap: {            filename: '[name].[chunkhash].js'          },          styles: {            name: 'styles',            test: /\.(css|sass|scss)$/,            chunks: 'all'          }        }      }    },   plugins: [      new MiniCssExtractPlugin({ filename: 'style.css' })   ],   rules: [       {          test: /\.(sa|sc|c)ss$/,          use: [MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,  'css-loader', 'sass-loader']       }   ]}``` I use scss and import it in jsx files. debugging webpack I see that all assets\chunks are full with css styles. So something happens at the very last step. I need this `styles.css` file as I use some scaffold, which is designed to expect this only one file for stylesheets. I also need `bootstrap` group of chunks as it's expected by that scaffold, so I can't remove all chunks. Can I switch off chunks only for css styles? 
solution: 

issue: This is my full webpack.config file ```javascriptrequire('@babel/polyfill');var path = require('path');var webpackType = 'loan';var entryObject = { list: {  app: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/js/list/index.js') }, detail: {  app: path.join(__dirname, 'src/js/list/index.js') }};module.exports = { devtool: 'source-map', context: path.resolve(__dirname), mode: 'development', entry: entryObject[webpackType], output: {  path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'public/assets/js/' + webpackType),  filename: '[name].min.js',  chunkFilename: 'vendors.min.js' }, module: {  rules: [   {    test: /\.jsx?$/,    loader: 'babel-loader',    exclude: /node_modules/,    query: {     cacheDirectory: true,     presets: [      ['@babel/preset-env', {       "targets": {        "browsers": ["last 2 versions", ">= 5% in KR"]       }      }],      '@babel/react'],     plugins: [      '@babel/plugin-transform-runtime',      ['@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators', { 'legacy': true}],      ['@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties', { 'loose': true}]     ]    }   },   {    test: /\.css$/,    use: [{     loader: "style-loader"    },     {      loader: "css-loader"     }    ]   }  ] }, resolve: {  modules: [path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules')],  extensions: ['.js', '.jsx'] }, optimization: {  minimize: false,  splitChunks: {   cacheGroups: {    commons: {     test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,     name: 'vendors',     chunks: 'all'    }   }  } }};```

issue: Hi! I've been meaning to ask a question regarding aliases Could you please take a look at this one? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56585160/webpack-aliases-appear-to-not-work-in-js-files-on-a-cra-application? I wonder if there is something extra on webpack that has to be done with `.js` files 
solution: 

issue: i think that default extension for extensionless import in webpack is js and when you do this `import {c1} from 'containers'` it looks for `container.js` and if there is no such file then for `containers/index.js` so, maybe you should define your named exports with extension```export { c1 } from ‘./c1/c1.jsx’;export { c2 } from ‘./c2/c2.jsx’;``` 
solution: 

issue: @taburetkin actually the `index.js` I use is there on the edit, and it looks exactly like what you wrote minus the `.jsx` extensions. This works for me in jsx files though @taburetkin I tried changing my code to `import { c1 } from 'containers/index.js';` but that doesn't work either 
solution: 

issue: @Sliqric7053 It looks like you're on the right track, although I don't know if the asterisk belongs there (you'll notice there's not one in the example). Here's some better info though: I found that webpack-dev-server uses http-proxy-middleware to do its proxying, and there's more documentation about the `pathRewrite` variable here: https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware/blob/a30a74b91dc4bd042ecf292d7862ec17e187baf1/recipes/pathRewrite.md It specifies how to provide your own rewrite function! so if the other solutions don't work, you can always resort to that. 
solution: 

issue: More info to add, by using `compiler.hooks.done.tap`, I have to use `process.exit(1)` to prevent Webpack throw it's own webpack bundle info and  error message like `...Assets, size, chunks....ERROR in ./src/js/a/b/c.jsx`. So I am looking for a way to catch the error where no error and bundle info from Webpack will be displayed. The problem of using `process.exit(1)` is that it will stop integration tests. 
solution: 

issue: @taburetkin I changed my `index.js` to use the extensions, and it doesn't work I did, however, change the line to `import { c1 } from 'containers/c1/c1';` and it works, whether using the `.jsx` extension in the index file or not so is the error that the `.js` file doesn't seem to recognize the `index.js` when using `import { c1 } from 'containers';` ? As you can see, I try to shorten my code as much as possible, hence my not using `.jsx` extensions as having them makes no difference. I could leave my import as `containers/c1/c1` but if it works in `.jsx` files as `containers`, then what to do to get it to work this way?

My current problem is better documented with error logs and configs here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56652338/sass-loader-unable-to-properly-parse-scss-files 
solution: In this case I am not trying to use sass as a loader, but trying to bundle the sass compiler into a CLI tool. 

issue: Hi, in output management guide, what is the need for linking both the bundles i.e., app.bundle.js, print.bundle.js in index.htmlI could see the console even when print.bundle.js not linked.

issue: Hi there. I'm attempting to include a JSON file as an asset and NOT as part of the bundle. I have a config file that needs to be edited by the customer after deployment that can't be packaged in with the rest of my code. I'm having no luck figuring out how to do this. Can anyone point me in the right direction for this? Thanks. 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys, am having an issue with my web pack set up when I include the js file to the index.html ... I am getting "exports is not defined" 
solution: you should use webpacks html plugin and inject what you need. remove the metadata and chunks option. 

issue:  {          test: /\.js$/i, loader: 'babel-loader', exclude: nodeModulesDir,          options: coverage ? {sourceMap: 'inline', plugins: ['istanbul']} : {}        }, thats what my aurelia app uses @jpserrett why not use copyplugin and ignore json in bundle new IgnorePlugin(/^\.\/pdf.worker.js$/), 
solution: 

issue: @saulhardman I found this info yesterday and tried it ( and just gave it a try again just now ) and it doesn't seem to change anything. Let me show you my config in case something is messed up there. 
solution: 

issue: i havent payed att realy but no reason to parse the json files if you only want to copy them 
solution: Ideally, you'd set the `include` to that single config file that you want the client to be able to update.. 

issue: @saulhardman I got file-loader to work and its outputting the json as I was expecting. But now it seems that the bundle isn't referencing it correctly. Within the original file I'm importing it like so: `import * as appConfig from './config.json';` Everything looks ok, so I'm kind of at a loss as to why this isn't working as I thought it would. config.json the string 
solution: 

issue: Are you getting any errors? What's the result of `console.log({ appConfig });`? OK, I'm fairly sure you don't need the `import * as`, you should be able to `import appConfig`. That shouldn't make a difference to the output though. We're back to using `fetch(appConfig)` I think. `appConfig` should be named `appConfigUrl` now, really. Depending on your configuration you can either use the Promise API or `async/await`. ```jsimport appConfigUrl from './config.json';fetch(appConfigUrl)  .then(response => response.json())  .then(appConfig => console.log(appConfig));``` 
solution: 

issue: Just edited the code above to call the `.json()` method on the response. 
solution: 

issue: In fact, to save some issues, I'll revert to the Promise API. Can't recall what the deal is with 'top-level await' right now. Updated the code again. Yeah, you could define an async method and immediately call that instead, but the Promise API makes sense enough. Depends on which style you prefer. Best to get it working first and then you can decide 
solution: 

issue: Yeah, I've done both before, but generally working with actual APIs. You'd think working with simple file structure things would be easier, but for some reason my brain just can't get around it today. Luckily I made Jest tests a long time ago so its an easy thing to test these changes. 
solution: 

issue: Well, I got a `fetch is not defined` error, I suppose because I'm using Node. I downloaded a package and its giving me fits, so I'm working through that 
solution: `node-fetch` should work nicely.. 

issue: hey, angular always uses webpack? i think i'm not fully understanding this concept 
solution: 

issue: Well, this is failing in just my written code - not even the Webpack stuff. But I'll look into updating that as well. 
solution: 

issue: So I'm tripped up on how to put that in my original code so that its properly defined to work outside of the bundle? 
solution: It states nothing about where Webpack will output it to during either development nor at build time.. 

issue: @jpserrett adding some more detail to the picture:```jsimport fetch from 'node-fetch';import appConfigUrl from './config.json';fetch(appConfigUrl)  .then(response => response.json())  .then(appConfig => {    console.log(appConfig);    // do what you need to do with the config data  });``` 
solution: 

issue: Yup. Pretty much exactly what I got. I followed the instructions for the `output.publicPath` as well. Now I'm just not sure how to get it into my entry point... 
solution: If you've set `output.publicPath` then the `appConfigUrl` should now be absolute, too.. 

issue: However, I'm now unsure if `./src/config.json` will be emitted by Webpack on build. (Emitted as in added to `./dist`.) Have a play around with that and see. 
solution: If I remove the `file-loader` it is not currently. You might need to use CopyWebpackPlugin in that case then.. 

issue: Ok, after doing all that, I get `TypeError: Cannot read property 'bind' of undefined` coming from my bundle 
solution: 

issue: Hi, everyone. I did some code editing between running npm start commands in my create-react-app And suddenly I get an error "Module not found: Can't resolve '*.svg' in '~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/ReactComponentsTest/components/src'" I did nothing to the svg file but edited index.js 
solution: 

issue: @ra312  What sort of "code editing"? It's likely you deleted something important if you are getting an error. 
solution: 

issue: @Rulexec thanks, that's what I have been doing and then using eval on the result, but I was hoping there was a better way Basically I am importing typesrcipt in the browser which does something like ```javascripttry {require('source-map-support') } catch(e) { /* lol I did not really want it */}``` webpack sees `source-map-support` an tries to bundle it in, it bring a lot of extra stuff I don't want Importing raw + eval works, but does not like the most efficient way I also can fake source map support, but it does not consistently work for me 
solution: 

issue: hello guys, anybody could help me with browserify and how to use require/imports please? I need to make it work with gulp, I gathered all my js in one bundle.js but the service-worker js is not recognizing an 'import'. The import is working in my other js files, why is this? 
solution: 

issue: How webpack hashing should work? if `__importDefault(__webpack_require__(8057))` `8057` changes, should the hash change as well? Also, should I use `contenthash`or `chunkhash `? The documentation is not very clear around this. 
solution: It's not documented in context of JS here: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/. 

issue: I'm wondering why my (pure) JS works when navigating on the same tab, but not when the same page is opened in a new tab It's an iframe usecase executed by a Google extension I couldn't find a pure JS community btw :/

issue: @evilebottnawi react dom server uses it this is all for react ssr 
solution: 

issue: unfortunately, you can't run `react-dom` in execjs without hacks and workaround and i think it still will be buggy/not working 
solution: 

issue: i do, unfortunately....things like social sharing and opengraph tags don't work without ssr 
solution: prepare `opengraph` tags on server, it is good practice. like json+ld. 

issue: how can webpack see a javascript files dependency?for example webpack sees my kendo.button.min.js file, however not the kendo.core.min file which is defined within it ```!function(e,define){define("kendo.button.min",["kendo.core.min"],e)}(function(){return function(e,n){ ...```i get the following: ```ERROR in ./kendo-sdk/js/kendo.button.min.jsModule not found: Error: Can't resolve 'kendo.core.min' in 'C:\project\kendo-sdk\js' @ ./kendo-sdk/js/kendo.button.min.js 26:2-51 @ ./src/main.js```

issue: Curious, the docs say that `cheap-source-map` options don't work with Terser (https://webpack.js.org/plugins/terser-webpack-plugin/#sourcemap) are there technical limitations or was it not prioritized for the initial work on the Terser plugin? 
solution: 

issue: hey, quick question, what is the absolutely last step of compilation i can tap into with a plugin?

issue: Hey folks, I am having a slight issue WDS websockets and I wanted to get your opinion on if this is a bug or not.  I have set a custom `sockPath` and we noticed that there are still a bunch of requests to `sockjs-node` (which result in `404`).  I'm not sure where they are coming from or why the custom `sockPath` is not being applied to them.

issue: you should use `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` for this case

solution: 

issue: I am writing a custom loader that should simply act as a transformer. Has the API changed recently? The [docs](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org/blob/master/src/content/contribute/writing-a-loader.md) state that a loader receives a source string.In my case I receive an object with the keys `resource`, `realResource`, `resourceQuery`, `issuer`, `compiler`.This is not a problem for me as I can read the file using `realResource`.But I have trouble returning the transformed source as Webpack looks for it in `node_modules`.This is a minimal example of the loader, which I believe follows the format defined in the docs:```javascriptmodule.exports = function(arg) {  console.log(arg.realResource);  return `module.exports  = ${JSON.stringify("hello")}`;}```Here is part of the trace I get```Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'module.exports = "hello"' in '/Users/bfdes/Projects/Blog'    resolve 'module.exports = "hello"' in '/Users/bfdes/Projects/Blog'      Parsed request is a module``` @surajkrishna It makes sense that you would need a separate entryfile and config for each build. 
solution: 

issue: Is there any way to make webpack keep a certain script at the top of the generated bundle?Inside src/index.js there is a piece of code that _must_ be included before everything else in the bundle, but after all operations are performed by webpack/babel, it ends up after a lot of other stuff.So, it is not a file that must be bundled first, but a piece of code inside src/index.js.

solution: 

issue: Hi all!  I'm confused about how I thought webpack worked. If I have a large library, but only import a couple of things from it, I thought webpack would only include those portions that were actually imported into my bundle. We're moving to CSS-in-JS styles and have created a library with our base styles, but even when I'm only importing just a couple, the entire lib is included in my build.

issue: Hi. I have an electron project which r uses a ceratin nodejs lib. Production build doesn't work, because webpack replaces require.resolve() with its own function which returns module IDs instead of paths. How to prevent webpack from doing this?I tried to add the problematic package to externals, but that doesn't seem to work. I want the app to use node's require() function. I know __non_webpack_require__ could be used, but I can't modify the code of the package, it's a 3rd party lib. So is there a better way? Anyone? The dev build works fine, and that's also built by webpack, so there must be a way to solve this. But I can't see any significant difference between the prod and dev webpack conf.

solution: 

issue: @jguddas  yes, the dist is built to support down to ie10. But I need to require the sources, right? Otherwise, I have polyfills and transformations that target ie10 bloating my code unnecessary because I only want to support ie11 I supposed that the way to go was to require sources and transpile everything myself to make sure I have the right target build? so suppose I have a library that uses promises. That will include the core-js polyfill for promises since it's not transformable by the runtime. If I use promises in my codebase aswell, wouldn't that mean that I have the polyfill twice in my codebase now?

issue: Hi guys, i dont know if this Channel is related to my issue, but i hope someone could help me, since i am struggling the last days. I use nrwl nx together with nestjs. Nx uses webpack und bundles my backend to a single main.js. The problem is that i am using knex.js and when i bundle my backend i can't find the migrations. Related issue: https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/1167

issue: @tomm1996 yes if they inline or use a different polyfill but not if they use core-js as well

issue: Hi! Tell me, is it possible to make chunks (underlined by a red line on the screen) not included in entry points? I need to get only vendor and entry point. [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/webpack/webpack/2S6m/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/webpack/webpack/2S6m/image.png) I can achieve the desired result using this configuration, but, in this case, the code size increases.

solution: 

issue: why do you want to do this in the first place? why not just use `resourceQuery` in that case? 
solution: 

issue: @gnvcor  You should use something like the assets-webpack-plugin to generate a json file that tells you what files are required for each entrypoint.. 
solution: 

issue: seams more like a babel issue, idk 
solution: 

issue: @deAtog thanks for the answer. Yes, I know such a plugin, but in my situation it will not help, since I need to get only 2 files in Entrypoint: vendor.js and entry.js guys, have any ideas, how can you get only 2 files in Entrypoint: vendor and entry?I know there is a way to prevent the webpack from creating chunks default and common, but in this case the size of the code base only increases...

solution: 

issue: @NailRode yes, but if I understand correctly, this configuration is for webpack 3, but I need for webpack 4 
solution: 

issue: @gnvcor  Sorry, I can't help you. I haven't worked with Webpack 3 at all.. I advise against having consistent bundle names as it creates a client caching issue. The plugins I mentioned were designed so that you can extract the necessary assets for a given entrypoint from them so you don't have to worry about what or how they are named.

issue: > Could anybody provide some solution around this problem on how to generate css classname hashes but not enabling css-modules at the same time?No way, you should use css modules, we can't compress classes without locals, because it is potentially break code, but you can use `postcss-loader`

issue: hi everyone, i am upgrading my works' sizable app from webpack 3.0 -> webpack 4.0.  so far the biggest challenge was translating CommonsChunkPlugin to SplitChunksPlugin.during the process I have some questions: 1) i used to have multiple CommonsChunksPlugins, to separate _library_, _node_modules_, and _application code_ bundles.  to achieve this in Webpack 4, should i use `cacheGroups`? 
solution: 

issue: Got a question.  In the typescript docs, they mention a peculiar method for loading non-typescript files: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html#wildcard-module-declarations Essentially, allowing adding a pesudo-mime-type on the end of the import, so it ends up looking like this: `import fileContent from "./xyz.txt!text";` Trouble is, this totally messed up webpack, as it thinks that `text` is the name of a module or something, and gives an error trying to import it. 
solution: 

issue: I did find something that does work: `import fileContent from "./foo.txt"` and using `declare module '*.txt'`.  However, TS's original method with the exclamation mark seems to be safer by not relying on file extensions, so I'm curious how I could get that working instead.

issue: Hi, I am using babel-loader with @babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import plugin, and it seems to be prefixing my bundled modules with  './' ... e.g. './my_module', however the code generated to require them, only uses 'my_module'... no './'... If I edit the generated source and remove './' from the module definition, then it loads ok... any ideas where I should be looking in my config to identify why this is happening? the generated script is being run in a node environment... 
solution: 

issue: hey... when trying to  using dynamic import for a module, my the bundle renderer throws error "render function or template not defined in component"... however if I import directly into my main file (no async), then it renders fine...

issue: ```js  entry: {    runtime: ['iifePolyfill'],    main: ['./main.js']  },  optimization: {    runtimeChunk: {      name: 'runtime'    }  }```I realized that when I do this, my `iifePolyfill` does not run immediately. However if I shift `iifePolyfill` into the `main` array, the polyfill will run.Are we not supposed to do this in the runtime chunk ? 
solution: @kwisatz i meant the general size of the project - is it small hobby project, or a big enterprise thing...but now that is see your output, i actually have no idea :(.

issue: you say about communication with other program like browser it is always os depended Do you understand how a tab is opened? no it is click for you, but it is not click for other programs It is running child_process look https://github.com/sindresorhus/open/blob/master/index.js it is package what open tab, you can find many os depended code You are not the first to want this behavior and it has not yet been implemented for a number of technical reasons that cannot be solved. right now browser doesn't prove api on js simple: we can't to ask browser open package in same tab because browser doesn't have api for this 
solution: 

issue: like **ALL** browser, i guess "brower" == "to all major browsers" == [Chrome, Firefox, IE, Opera, etc]your saying not a single browser provides a feature as the one we're describing? 
solution: @ipatch I think you are misunderstanding the issue here.. to open a URI or file on Linux, OSX, Windows, etc. most applications just pass the URI or file location to an external program which then determines how to open the given URI or file. The process used is similar to how a file browser opens a file and is equivalent to requesting the same file be opened multiple times..

solution: 

issue: yes, i know why. my chunk is not loading because i re-bundled the modules again and uploaded them to the server. meanwhile, a user was already on the webapp, but when they want to navigate to another page that requires a dynamically loaded chunk, the chunk name is not there because chunk name has changed 
solution: 

issue: @johnmarinelli maybe i was not clear in my description. The thing is, there are several times when a chunk will not be found, like when there is no network, or the server is down, or the chunk that was meant to be loaded dynamically has been deleted at the server, or *the chunk that was meant to be loaded dynamically has been replaced by another update/build* from a security update to the code.The last two cases will occur if the client/user was already in the browser, but they attempt to go the page that requires the chunk that is no longer there... so, boom... the chunk cant be loaded... *now, i needed to catch that error that the chunk cant be loaded*, which i figured out, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/57860730/3563013

solution: but there is a property in configuration file. 

issue: Hi there, is there a way to simulate '[contenthash]' in webpack 3? I need it to basically have a library exposed with a static file name (where the '[contenthash]' would function as a lib version) For just one file, for the others I still need to use '[hash]' 
solution: 

issue: It's just a string, you can put anything in there. For example `libname.${require('./package.json').version}.js` 
solution: It doesn't break anything, my webpack works like a charm, but why I've got this `undefined`?. cf https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader#getting-started. 

issue: @Munter Using [contenthash] would've also been a mechanism to automatically update the "version" number whenever necessary without additional hassle. Thank you for your suggestion, I'll use it :)

issue: ive spent the last few days trying to get my CRA app ported to electron :( between webpack, babel and eslint issues im really confused. i think i am close… but im hitting this issue https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/7953 im trying to get webpack to use the non-browser version of superagent in my electron app but like this issue  says using target:’electron-renderer’ causes webpack to pick up the browser version 
solution: 

issue: @mx2323 you can change `resolve.mainFields` so that it will only pick up the `main` entry from a package's package.json file. This may or may not fix your issue though. 
solution: 

issue: well - i just used a nodejs specific library instead of superagent and everything appears to be ok but yeah this issue - https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/7953 huge PITA. trying to package two different versions, one for node, one for electron, one for web. and getting that work…. is not easy skipping for now

issue: Hi all, maybe not strictly a Webpack question, but, I want to merge two separate SCSS files and have matching values from one overwrite matching values from the other. So I'd have a base _variables file with all variables defined there, then a second smaller _variables file containing only a subset of of all the variables, but have the ones that are in the second file to overwrite the ones in the first. Can this be done in Webpack? If not, any suggestions? 
solution: 

issue: Hi,I am fetching chunk failed issue this issue not every time but some time it will get this issue can you  please provide some details about this issue 
solution: 

issue: @divsbhalala hmmm there's a lot going on in there. Here's my advice, from debugging configs I've worked with:1. try to isolate it down. Does it happen in production and development? 2. in development mode, webpack doesn't write the manifest to disk. If you tell it to do that (I forget if you need a plugin for that or not), you can see the files the Webpack is aware of. Is the failed chunk in the manifest? 3. you are naming your chunks, so that should help debug it

issue: $50 if someone can help me solve this issue:How can I get Webpack to load either the browser XOR node version of a dependency?I have a project that has both node and browser dependencies (node crypto vs webcrypto) and for everyone who has switched to Webpack, it's been broken for... a long time.

issue: Hey! I'm writing a Webpack plugin, and I need to write some global variables into my program. Is there a way I can simply use `definePlugin` inside of my plugin, or would I need to copy its behaviour that I need? 
solution: 

issue: oh! haha, it was actually the opposite.   2 of the 3 configs were succeeding.    So it wasn't bailing and shutting down/outputting the errors.   I guess you have to use `bail: true` with multiconfig

solution: 

issue: Is there a benefit to `splitChunk` having a `maxSize` of like 300kb so it chunks everything into smaller files that the brower can download in parallel faster or is that a myth? 
solution: 

issue: You won't be paying a tax on importing the whole thing then. If this was a huge library and you only wanted a tiny part of it with named imports, you would be able to treeshake the unused parts out. You can't do that with the above setup. But this library only contains what you need, so it's fine 
solution: 

issue: @Munter ahhh ahaha i’m so used to using async fn’s now didn’t even think about using `.then` lol and yeah you’re right, he uses a named export but there’s not really any benefit for tree shaking since it’s the only thing exported 
solution: 

issue: Hello, i have an issue with proxy in webpack-dev-server, not all header are going to the browser, after some investigation it looks like proxy server can't operate 'set-cookie' as an array, do you know some workarounds or maybe you know how to send raw headers so browser will get all the data.

solution: 

issue: So far web pack can only be executed while you are doing that. Where you get this web pack plugin? If you can't exceute during the process the web pack is no longer valid This is from Git Hub isn't? Emm yours are different than mine. Where at? Take care Bye catch you soon 
solution: 

issue: a simpler question would be: where can I put configuration to run some arbitrary js code every time a build is re-started? I can't find an answer to that either 
solution: 

issue: @Munter I dont know which one is better but that loader is just for webpack, the actual library is this one https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/essentials 
solution: 

issue: That's what I'm looking at. The loading part is essentially just getting some json into the runtime. Not a big deal. The translation stuff though, there be dragons 
solution: 

issue: I'll take your word for it, it does have an easier learning curve vs something like ```const msgSrc = `{GENDER, select, male {He}  female {She}  other {They}} found {RES, plural,  =0 {no results}  one {1 result}  other {# results}}.`;```but I guess that also means less flexibility, I really dont know I doubt this project will ever hire professional translators, maybe thats why they have a developer working the translations and not a rigorous process for it

issue: after some search it seems that i have to setup multiple application entries in webpack config```entry: {  blue: './src/index.blue.js`,  green: './src/index.green.js`}```and in those files i have to import different less variables.this will lead to producing two output js files and i have to do some work  (not sure what exactlym its just a thought)is there more elegant way to achieve what i want? and one more questionwhy hmr for css hot updates only once?

issue: I'm using grpc framework **var grpc = require('grpc')** when bundling through webpack.  I'm getting errors  **Can't resolve fs**  and ** Can't resolve child_process** .  How to fix it?

Is there a known workaround for this ? Thanks

solution: 

issue: @JakeDVirus this is the way modules work. I've never had to export 100 things ever. If you do, you probably need to work on your encapsulation

issue: @Munter actually i was not using any task runner before. so made my own js architecture organised with self made library, helper functions, variables etc etc... now i am switching to webpack  and the only pain in my ass is in getting all my several dependency js files to combile in one js file.. What shal i do? 
solution: 

issue: It's always tough work to go from non-modules to modules. I don't know any shortcuts. It's just hard work identifying isolated functionality and repackaging it. What was your setup before? I always prefer modules. And I would recommend reworking your sources to them if you have the time and need to worka lot more with them. 
solution: 

issue: @Munter i'm being blunt here, what do u mean my "setup" here? 
solution:

issue: when installing webpack, would u install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server as dev-dependencies or just normal dependencies? I’m following a tutorial where he installs it using -S (which I THINK is the equalent of —save right?) correct me if I’m wrong - but to me it makes more sense to use webpack-dev-server only for dev purposes, while webpack and webpack-cli can be used for production, am I wrong? @evilebottnawi I had to install webpack-dev-server globally for it to work at all but if I dont install it globally it doesnt work at all even if I install it as a dev dep or normal dep when googling it, they do suggest me to install it globally 
solution:

issue: @JonatanSiden when you install it locally it creates an executable file in node_modules/.bin it would be added automatically if you don't want to install in in you app you can always use npx npx will download the package and run it on the fly npm will update the package.json file for you 
solution: 

issue: @JonatanSiden > but that would require me to include it in a script in my package.json right?Oh i misunderstood you here I'm pretty sure you don't need to add a "script" to the package.json all executables in `node_modules/.bin` can be run with `npm run` 
solution: 

issue: @dovidweisz do u usually install webpack with —save-dev or just the webpack-dev-server ? 
solution: I guess I do. but it really doesn't matter unless you're publishing a module to NPM. 

issue: Question: I follow a webpack tutorial that is using a folder called ”dist” - he is placing an index.html in that same folder that is served with webpack-dev-server when starting it Why is the index.html file in ”dist” and not in ”src” ? I thought of ”dist” as the folder which is a container for the webpack generated files, like bundle.js or whatever u call it, please explain to me if Im wrong here 
solution: 

issue: okay never mind, he moved it back to src after a while in the tutorial.. so Im guessing my thought about dist was correct?

issue: `webpack --json` dumps the resulting JSON into stdout. This is easy enough to capture with `webpack --json > webpack-stats.json`. Unfortunately, some teams love littering their webpack things with `console.log` or other output, which then makes its way into the file. This corrupts the JSON file, and makes it impossible to `JSON.parse`.1) Is there a way to just output the `--json` output to a file (obviously without changing teams' webpack config/scripts/etc)?2) If there's no way to do this, is this an appropriate feature request and should I open an Issue? I would be willing to implement it.

issue: is this a typo in the documentation??                                                                                                                                                          "What happens when you pass an array to entry? Passing an array of file paths to the entry property creates what is known as a "multi-main entry". This is useful when you would like to inject multiple dependent files together and graph their dependencies into one "chunk". " - documentation/entry points/ single entry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Is "dependent" a typo is this supposed to be independent?  listing independent files with different dependency graphs into a single bundle makes sense to me. If they have the same dependencies they would already be bundled together after bundling one, why list multiple files. So I am assuming this is a typo?

issue: Hey all, have been pulling my hair out a little. I need to get the public path of a different entry script from js, currently, I cheat and do it using `window.path_to_worker = '<%= htmlWebpackPlugin.files.chunks['indexeddb-worker'].entry %>';` in an inline script HTML, but trying to fix CSP unsafe-inline issues. I've tried loading it through `file-loader!babel-loader!...` but it doesn't get the same Babel transpilation as it does when listed as an entry. Is there some trick I am missing, I seemingly can't use the `worker-loader` because the underlying library wants the path to the script which to spin up in a workerAny and all help appreciated

issue: Hello! I have a question. Is it possible to configure webpack (or webpack-dev-server) to only build what is going to be used? E.g. I have 12k modules and 12 entry points in my app, but I only work with a few components in each feature and I don't want to wait to build my entire app each time I run webpack, when I only need those I'm working with. 
solution: 

issue: @paulkarabilo What you want to do is tree-shaking. Read up on that, i dont remember how exactly you can tell webpack that tree-shaking on modules is side-effect free. Tree-shaking would do exactly what you want it to - replacing import statements with the actual strings.

This works when I load into `HtmlWebpackPlugin`, or when `html-loader`is the only loader in the compilation for the html file, but if I load from `html-loader` into `extract-loader`, `DefinePlugin` doesn’t appear to do its replacement before `extract-loader` tries to process the file data. This means I get an error from `extractLoader.js` that says “NAME is not defined”. I am expecting `DefinePlugin` to process immediately after the `html-loader` step. What am I missing?

issue: @Munter The above example is for .css files, but actually I've got some .js script **which are not ES modules** too, and these needs to be included in the old way in my html page (after I merged all the js files in one using `webpack-merge-and-include-globally`). 
solution: @antonioaltamura Then these global files are probably in your compilation stats object, which means you can access their url in html-webpack-plugins templating. 

issue: Does anyone know what could cause webpack to suddenly detect changes in the node_modules directory? My app keeps recompiling without me even touching the code and it's because it thinks it's detecting changes in the node_modules

issue: I'm trying to use webpack to bundle some of my TypeScript files. The files include imports of node modules, but also imports of some other TypeScript files.

solution: 

issue: If anyone is interested, I finally solved it by whitelisting any required file that is rooted in any alias I setup (I added all packages to my `resolve.alias` to make the monorepo magic work).

issue: Hi all! I have a library that has a `main` field and a `module` field in its `package.json`. When imported with webpack it uses the `main` entry by default. If I remove the `main` file webpack will use the `module` entry. Is there a way to tell webpack to take the `module` entry even if `main` exists? I've specified `mainFields: ['module', 'main', 'browser']` in the webpack config, but the order doesn't seem to do anything I found something. It appears it had to do with the package in question being symlinked. When following the symlink (symlinks: true) webpack ignores module. Not sure why

issue: maybe put your eval in a different module to minimize the impact? I assume it has to do with "scope" which is why the Function vs eval approach yields different results. eval can access "local variables", so mangled variables would cause an error if the eval body was attemptying to use one of those variables this is probably a minification concern, not a webpack concern

issue: Hi! I am using webpack through the API. I can easily get warnings and errors out of "stats" at the end of the build, but I can't seem to figure out how to consume other kinds of logs (like debug, info). On the stats config docs: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/stats/ I've added "loggingDebug" with the name of the plugin I'm trying to debug, but honestly I'm not totally sure if the config is right - I'm using TypeScript and this isn't on the type of stats options. (Version 4.39.8), but I'm going with the online docs. But even so I'm not sure where I'd expect to be able to consume the debug logs. They don't get logged to the console, and I've inspected the entire concents of stats emitted and the logs I'm looking for are not there. I can't seem to find any documentation - any ideas?

issue: I'm very new to web pack - I am creating a library to help build the framework of my web app works on the client side. Sadly, I love jQuery and would love not to have to use DOM Mapping... so I built my stuff using jQuery' $ variable. The index.js file has access to this property but apparently the individual modules I'm creating don't. Is their anyway I can get the variable to continued to be passed.... I am also wondering if there is a way to tell web pack, to pack it but not change it's names. This way I can still use the console, execute code with jQuery, and not have to include jQuery on each page. I mean it is being packed.

Everything looks fine here too but, I see the sockjs-node cliemt doing requests and getting back CONNECTION REFUSED errors.

solution: 

issue: No I don't think it's the plugin. It's just not updating the files if they already exist.  The plugin was the only thing making it work when it's first run because it was cleaning out the folder. So the files are only getting built if they don't already exist.

solution: 

issue: @platoputhur I believe it means that webpack may have vulnerabilities in it where carefully crafted code causes webpack to do something unexpected and run something it wasn't supposed to. If you're compiling code on behalf of users, they might be able to find a remote-code-execution vulnerability in webpack and submit code that triggers it. It means it wasn't written with the security model of compiling untrusted code in mind, so it might do stuff that is unsafe like passing code to lower level tools or not carefully sanitizing input everywhere

issue: Hello, I have an issue with Webpack (5.x) and Express setup!So I've created a configuration (with `watch: true`) and this compiles my project into one file (`dist/server.js`), then I run it with `nodemon dist/server.js`. This way my code rebuilds each change, and the Express server restarts too!But I have issue with this setup, I'm actually running `webpack --mode development` and `nodemon dist/server.js` in the same time, they both watch for changes...What I really want is do something like `webpack --mode development && nodemon dist/server.js`, but because the configuration is with `watch: true` thew first command don't finish, and so `nodemon` won't start.Question is can I make so webpack will build with watch capability on, but not actually watch the files when I run so `nodemon` can take over?Or... Can I make so webpack itself is not included (bundled) in the build?

issue: Does anyone know how I might handle routes with dots in them with webpack-dev-server proxies? Here's my [webpack config](https://gist.github.com/Khauri/ab21cd6a5a52caf178ecd148c10a408e)I essentially have a url, `/.Hgvs_p1NQV4AFEoM5470ceQg/status` that I expect to be passed on to my server via the proxy, but instead I get a 404 and a page that says `Cannot GET /.Hgvs_p1NQV4AFEoM5470ceQg/status`. Which I think means the webpack-dev-server is interpreting my url as an asset and trying to find it, but can't. I have the historyAPIFallback option disabled and every other page works fine, just not the ones with dots in the route.Also this doesn't happen in a build, only when proxied using webpack dev server.

I was indeed using components defined as classes as if they were function, but since that check was not failing with webpack v3 (and I haven't changed anything else), I'm wondering why it has started to happen with v4 and if there's a way to keep the old (probably undocumented if not plain wrong) behavior. I'm using `babel` v6 and `babel-loader` v7. Thanks! Alternatively, how can I make webpack v3 raise the same `TypeError` so that I can fix my code before upgrading to v4?

solution: 

issue: Also, @Devinora_gitlab this is directly from the [webpack documentation on why `main.js` is the file name](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/#output): ```The output property tells webpack where to emit the bundles it creates and how to name these files.

solution: 

issue: `webpack` seems to fail at resolving dependencies of my dependencies. It's only happening with one dependency, though: `wouter`. I don't know how to reproduce it with other packages because it's the only one causing the issue so far. If you want, check out this repository at the following commit. https://github.com/johnrichardrinehart/wouter/commit/7d6938c83a311f3e35db55f271e4724822f5e6dc Execute `yarn run build` in that repository and you'll get a bunch of errors that look like what I described [here](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter/issues/150) . I managed to fix this by adding `resolve: {fullySpecified: false}` to my `webpack.config.js` file. But, it's not clear to me why I need to do this, since the failing dependency (`wouter`) uses file extensions for all local imports. It seems that `webpack` is resolving my dependency's use of `import "react"` to a local file and then complaining that it can't find it. But, that makes no sense. Can anyone help me debug this issue? Otherwise, I'll file a GitHub issue. The GitHub issue template instructed me to try Gitter first.

solution: 

issue: Hey all! I am stuck with a problem and would really appreciate some help. Basically I am trying to get the paths of all files included in an entrypoint. The app I am working on has 6-7 entrypoints and I need to get information about which source files are included in which entrypoint. I am exploring the compiler and compilation hooks, but can't wrap my head around a workable solution. 
solution: 

issue: I have a problem like @vstoyanoff I have two top-level `js` files (`a.js` and `b.js`) that both `import "index.css"`. Both `a.js` and `b.js` are `entrypoint`s. So, I get `a.css` and `b.css` output when I use `MiniCSSExtractPlugin`. But, I only want one `shared.css`. @vstoyanoff Is this kind of related to your problem? And, I can't add it to the HTML template because it has the `hash` in the `name`. I just figured it out.

solution: 

issue: Hey, I seem to be having a problem with Module Federation and material-ui that I'm wondering if anyone else has came across. We have quite a large app which is being split up into a container and various micro-frontends. The container has material-ui components a long with the ThemeProvider etc. The micro-frontends are also using material-ui components, we've added all the `@material-ui/*` libraries to the shared object in both apps, but it seems like multiple parts of material-ui are being loaded from either the container or the sub apps and we can't seem to force any consistency, we'd just like the container to provide the entire of material-ui. It's resulting in inconsistent import orders and duplicate `<style>` tags etc. We've tried supplying `externals` and also forcing all the packages into a chunk and neither work.

issue: hi guys.. I have an problem with vue files... after bundlig i am getting this error "Cannot read property 'toLowerCase' of undefined" Can anyone help on this.. I am Using webpack 4 along with vue ^2.2.6 
solution: 

issue: Hi, any idea why in Webpack 5 chunks from `splitChunks.cacheGroups` seem be named by output.filename, not `output.chunkFilename`? Here is the relevant code:```    output: {      filename: '[name].test.js',      path: __dirname,       publicPath: '/resources/',      chunkFilename: '[chunkhash].chunk.js'    },    splitChunks: {        chunks: 'async',        minSize: 20000,        minRemainingSize: 0,        maxSize: 0,        minChunks: 1,        maxAsyncRequests: 30,        maxInitialRequests: 30,        enforceSizeThreshold: 50000,        cacheGroups: {          defaultVendors: {            test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,            priority: -10,            reuseExistingChunk: true          },          default: {            minChunks: 2,            priority: -20,            reuseExistingChunk: true          }        }      }```Anything coming out of `splitchunks.cacheGroup.defaultVendors` is being named `something.test.js`, not `[chunkhash].chunk.js`.Thanks!

issue: Hello,Is there a @types package for webpack-dev-server@next ? (v4.0.0-beta.0)Thanks! 
solution: 

issue: Turns out the webpack-dev-server is not yet compatible with webpack 5. Using webpack-dev-server v4.0.0-beta.0 makes it work 
solution: 

issue: I'm trying out webpack 5's new asset/resource concept, but I'm struggling to do a very simple thing. I followed the webpack documentation on how to generate additional webp formats, but when they are generated like this I can not influence the directory they end up in. 
solution: 

issue: depends on where you live/work 
solution: 

issue: Hi everyone, i was wondering if someone could help me. I have webpack 4 and recently updates the resolve paths to absolute paths. But now vscode go to definitions do not go to the correct modules the paths however seem to be correct. 
solution: 

issue: But, I want to write LIB.MyClass or rollup instead of webpack 
solution: 

issue: Is it possible to get webpack to replace a require with the public path of an asset as a string? For example:```sourceMap.SourceMapConsumer.initialize({    "lib/mappings.wasm": require("source-map/lib/mappings.wasm");)}```Would be:```sourceMap.SourceMapConsumer.initialize({    "lib/mappings.wasm": "lib/mappings.wasm")}```assuming that the file loader copies `*.wasm` to `lib` 
solution: 

issue: In v4, this is what `file-loader` does.  In v5, it's `type: "asset/resource"` per https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-modules/ I'm not sure it will fix your issue but you should change to `material-design-icons-iconfont`, the `material-design-icons` package is intended for people who want to build their own fonts from sources it's not really kept up to date and is an order of magnitude larger You have two `rules` for each font type, I'm not sure what happens when two rules match the same file.  (First one wins maybe?) 
solution: 

issue: got a slightly odd webpack setup - wondered if someone could advise? i have a server-side nestjs application that i need to compile with webpack as well as a frontend app that i need to bundle with the same webpack config i know you can have multiple configs in one file, but the back-end app has it's own static server built in that i want to use in prod, but not dev 
solution: 

issue: Hey folks, getting this error from webpack:`ERROR in NormalModuleFactory.beforeResolve is no longer a waterfall hook, but a bailing hook instead. Do not return the passed object, but modify it instead. Returning false will ignore the request and results in no module created.` I've tried deduping versions of webpack, but i can't get any more info on what's wrong 
solution: 

issue: fixed it by updating my webpack version 
solution: 

issue: Ah, I refreshed my browser and the page seems to be now up-to-date. Yeah definitely `webpack serve` not `webpack --serve`, that was a mistake on my part. Thanks! 
solution: 

issue: I think you want to find a channel for your site designer (coffeecup) or the Materialize framework.  This chat is for webpack, a tool that it sounds like you do not use

solution: 

issue: I know that webpack 5 stopped to expose process.env to the bundle. I need to use it anyway as we have libraries that I can't adapt. Therefore, I decided to manually define process.env like suggested in the webpack 5 configuration.```    },    plugins: [        new webpack.DefinePlugin({            'process.env.NODE_ENV': process.env.NODE_ENV,        }),```But no matter what I try, I can't use `process.env.NODE_ENV` in my application (the js provded as "entry") as `process` is always undefined. process.env.NODE_ENV is defined in the webpack.config - I already checked that. Any ideas? 
solution: 

issue: Actually I figured it out. memory-fs is just the worst thing ever, it's not compatible with other fs like memfs so I was wasting my time trying to use memfs what the fuck? Why don't make a library that respects standards?... 
solution: 

issue: I switched over to using webpack-dev-server v4 beta, and the watchOptions option is gone. Did this functionality move to somewhere else? I'm not seeing much in the options. 
solution: 

issue: Hi What does this message mean in the webpack compile log?` Field 'browser' doesn't contain a valid alias configuration`? Thanks 
solution: 

issue: From what I understand, the Webpack team's position is that either all your dependencies should configure their `exports` field to explicitly specify exactly what to provide, correctly (using conditionals, etc), or you as the consumer can set `resolve.exportsFields: []` and ignore `exports` completely I'm not sure I agree 
solution: 

issue: i'm having  a couple of issues  with webpack 4,  i'm trying to get require("#root/validations.js") to work but  resolve: { alias: {  "#root": path.resolve(__dirname, '/src')}} doesn't seem to do the trick thoughts? 
solution: 

issue: @aspirisen - check libraryTarget. You can set it to use global object, though I can't remember the type.  'umd' probably covers ithttps://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#module-definition-systems 
solution: 

issue: I'm trying to create a custom librarytarget plugin. In the code of EnableLibraryPlugin.js I see "Plugins which provide custom library types must call EnableLibraryPlugin.setEnabled(compiler, type) to disable this error.`);". Is there sample code that shows this, or documentation for this? 
solution: 

issue: is there a way to have HtmlWebpackPlugin replace css styles with the one generated with css-modules in webpack. this is my current partial config```use: [    { loader: MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader },    {loader: 'css-loader',     options: {            modules: {                compileType: "module",                localIdentName: '[sha1hex:4]',            },            importLoaders: 1     }   }],``` 
solution: 

issue: Hey folks. I'm using webpack5.The following POC:```jsconst HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');const HtmlWebpackRootElementPlugin = require('html-webpack-root-element-plugin');module.exports = {  plugins: [    new HtmlWebpackRootElementPlugin(),    new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),  ],};```Produces:\> webpack webpack: Starting Build command: A webpack error occured while building: use --log-level=debug for more error detail command: Cannot read property 'tap' of undefined ---> Is there a move/mv/rename webpack plugin? Or a skip emit plugin so I can filter out the emitted original files and only keep the copied ones?@strarsis  Why not specify those files as `ignore` to your loader(s)? 
solution: 

issue: @robertmain: The loader would be the thing that uses the actual emitted files, right? In this case the loader is a PostCSS plugin, PostCSS itself is used as a webpack plugin. How can I access the actual loader? 
solution: 

issue: Hello everyone, Im using webpack 5, or better to say, was upgrading from webpack v4 to v5 and upgrading from react-loadable to loadable-component and now I have really strange issue with react devtools, more here 
solution: 

issue: Although, it doesn't seem to be working but thats for me to figure out Thanks 
solution: 

issue: @bbepis that's interesting, I've never tried to customize sourcemaps like that.  Seems like an issue with that plugin?  One thing you could try, if you're not already, is to configure `optimization.minimizer` using the `TerserPlugin`, to exclude node_modules from minification Because if it's not getting minified in the first place it shouldn't have sourcemaps (just using `devtool: 'source-map'` or whatever) actually it's kind of bonkers that the default config does not appear to exclude node_modules -- I don't want to re-minify all my dang dependencies on every build, they should be exposing pre-minified sources via their package file in the first place 
solution: 

issue: You're quite welcome, I actually came to ask for help and just stayed because I learn from watching what other people do with webpack I'm a lot more productive because of webpack but of all the tools in my figurative toolbox, it still feels like the one with the most "magic", or at least the one that I have the hardest time debugging when it doesn't do what I expected 
solution: 

issue: I'm writing a loader to do some tricky work and has a question. Can a loader know processing file is imported dynamically or statically? 
solution: 

issue: I don't know how it can be working locally because the error from the console is correct: you don't have "webpack" in your Karma config's `frameworks` see the example on [the docs page](https://github.com/ryanclark/karma-webpack) 
solution: 

issue: Hi I am new to Webpack. It's unclear about how I can install this project on my machine. I guess 'npm install --save-dev webpack' would install the original Webpack software, but what I want to install is this project on my machine.

issue: Is anyone else having problems with no page reloading with webpack-dev-middleware + webpack-hot-middleware + react, after updating all to latest versions? I'm getting the above error about unaccepted modules and nothing to update. It worked with old versions of each, but since updating, it stopped. I can't find anything in the docs about this... Ah, for the above, it is a known issue for a few months guys. Issue #390. https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-hot-middleware/issues/390 
solution: 

issue: The idea behind webpack is that all the build steps needed for your application are orchestrated with one tool, based on a single config that said I don't know why you'd want to run eslint or prettier in a loader, that doesn't sound like part of a build process to me I'm a bit confused what you mean about "uglified code", eslint does not uglify / minify / compress code 
solution: 

issue: Hi Everyone,Error: Couldn't find a style target. How to fix it?I had a CSR app and now implemented Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with React, and get this error> Error: Couldn't find a style target. This probably means that the value for the 'insert' parameter is invalidGet this error when I run the server and try to access the page.Tech sack in use: nodejs, reactjs, antdesign, babel and webpack.I already tried a lot of solutions from StackOverflow and other sources, nothing helped! Please, help me to solve it.Thank you! Need your help. Thanks 
solution: You need to provide us more info/ setup a minimal example or show us your webpack setup. I know what it is, you cannot use style-loader server side. Find the loader like this: [$<$-LINK-$>$] just use style-loader instead, and remove it.. or switch to razzle :)

issue: has anyone tried html-webpack-plugin and static-i18n together? it's acting up for me, like if they had conflicts and the html output isn't what it should be 
solution: 

issue: Hopefully tomorrow, waiting for the one who reported the error i fixed to confirm it is fixed. run it thru webpack twice is the only way i see 
solution: 

issue: @fivethreeo then the dynamic vars or data-t from the json are not rendered in the html  it's like html webpack plugin adds the css and the js to my html and does not render the locales and i18n renders the data from the locales but removed the css and js. Never ending story! 
solution: 

issue: Hey folks! Do you know how can I match a `beforeCompile` hook run, with its corresponding `afterCompile` ? Been trying to play with hooks for a bit and cant seem to make it happen.Maybe they are sequential? As in... if we are going to run multiple compilations a compilation will always close/seal before starting a new one? So I'll always see a:  `beforeCompile` -> `afterCompile` -> `beforeCompile` -> `afterCompile` And never a `beforeCompile (A)` -> `beforeCompile (B)` -> `afterCompile (A) `-> `beforeCompile (C)` -> `afterCompile (B)`  -> `afterCompile (C)` ?

issue: These are the non local file imports:```import 'source-map-support/register';import {    ExtensionContext,    commands,    Disposable,    Uri,    WorkspaceEdit,    ExtensionMode,    window,    languages,    Range,    workspace} from 'vscode';import { AbortError } from 'fetch-h2';``` When I added `esnext` into the `lib` field of  `tsconfig.json` I didn't need to add any import to get `WeakRef` to work. But I assume your questions points to the fact that I might need some explicit import? 
solution:

solution: 

issue: Hi everyone -- I have a question I can't seem to figure out. I have what I believe is a pretty standard node.js / TypeScript configuration, but I would like to "force include" a dependency in my final bundle, despite it not being used in my codebase. Is this possible?

issue: Hey... I've been beating my head against the wall all morning with this -- but I can't figure out how to stop my <link> / <style> getting loaded after <script> -- this causes the script to momentarily block the css leading in this case to a flash of transition on page.  Obviously if I just reorder this manually it works fine! but how do I tell webpack to load my .css before my .js? 
solution: 

issue: Hi! does the css loader(https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-loader) generate inline css in the generated webpack bundle file? I saw that it does not take output as a param... 
solution: 

issue: If you're trying to twiddle cache headers you're probably overthinking it -- have you tried `webpack-dev-server`? You can use the [DLL Plugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/dll-plugin/) to make a precompiled bundle, or you can do the [externals thing](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/externals/).  I've used the former but not the latter.  It's a little bit of a headache and didn't actually help my use case Of course if you use the cacheable file from your server (via external or DLL reference), Webpack can't tree-shake for you 
solution: 

issue: The specific problem I am running into is that I have a subproject (which is a library) having its own webpack.config.js, but when I refer to this subproject in the main project webpack config with "dependOn", it says entry not found. I understand that it has not been found, but I would like to know how I can make the main project webpack config see the "scope" of the subproject config should I use runtime instead of dependOn? I now tried it as a no-op js file, with dependOn defining the bundles to include, but that obviously doesn't work important note: I am trying to build a non-module library (pre es5 strict) 
solution: 

issue: I'm struggling with upgrading our outdated css loaders. I have a lot of warnings related to `"export 'default' (imported as 'styles') was not found in <file>"` 
solution: 

issue: @mauritslamers not possible to do that, the best might be to make the library use a watching compiler and make the project consuming it watch the dist dir of the library.
