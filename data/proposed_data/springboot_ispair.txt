issue: I'm working on a project where I face a little problem when I want to inject my FeignClients using the @autowired annotation 
solution: 

issue: @zersetz-end I assume you're talking about the one created for Spring MVC?If so, the conversion service is actually created by the `@EnableWebMvc` infrastructure and we're plugging in the converters you've defined as beans. See https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/1.5.x/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/web/WebMvcAutoConfiguration.java#L267 
solution: 

issue: Well, I'm asking because I'm currently working on this: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-kafka/pull/528 . And as i mentioned I would have thought that the ConversionService bean is something more "central", so I wanted to look up the bean by it's name. Now I'm not that sure anymore. 
solution: Or in Spring MVC (as pointed to by @bclozel). 

issue: Well originaly it just uses a simple instance of DefaultFormattingConversionService 
solution: Or it might use the "global" one provided by the `ApplicationContext`. (It has a well-known bean name). Yeah, the method referenced by @bclozel does the same. It's probably better to feed a new instance of the ConversionsService with all beans of type Converter. 

issue: Hi, I have a spring boot test annotated with ```@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)```Every now and then it fails with:```org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase   : A child container failed during start 
solution: 

issue: TomcatURLStreamHandlerFactory.java:130)at org.apache.catalina.webresources.TomcatURLStreamHandlerFactory.getInstanceInternal(TomcatURLStreamHandlerFactory.java:53)at org.apache.catalina.webresources.TomcatURLStreamHandlerFactory.register(TomcatURLStreamHandlerFactory.java:77)at org.apache.catalina.webresources.StandardRoot.registerURLStreamHandlerFactory(StandardRoot.java:699)at org.apache.catalina.webresources.StandardRoot.initInternal(StandardRoot.java:682)at org.apache.catalina.util.LifecycleBase.init(LifecycleBase.java:107)... 10 common frames omitted```I’m usint the version 2.0.0.M7. Any idea why? 
solution: 

issue: Maybe you could add an error handler at the servlet container level for `NoHandlerFoundException` (after setting up the above)? (And control the return code that way.) Yeah. So you have to switch that off with those settings that Brian referred to. You can change the path though As Brian said it's the only option. 
solution: 

issue: Hi. I'm having issues with OAuth2 in M7. The API/theory looks fantastic, but I can't get it to work. I posted a [question on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47972438/spring-boot-2-0-0-m7-and-oauth2-not-triggering-initial-redirect). It's driving me crazy. It would be great if someone took a look. for what its worth, the [Manual](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-oauth2/#_social_login_manual) worked untill M4 
solution: 

issue: Hi and happy new year, what's the Gitter for Spring Framework (not Boot)? shall I ask my question here? 
solution: No. 

issue: [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/27Hs/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/27Hs/image.png) [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/sNRh/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/sNRh/image.png) why not load the application-dev.properties [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/QQCA/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/QQCA/image.png) what? somebody can help me yes 
solution: 

issue: maybe need bootstrap.yml do u used `spring cloud` u must use `bootstrap.yml` 
solution: 

issue: Not fot the reason what's wrong? 
solution: 

issue: Actually, I think you could start the application with the listeners off, and start it in your test Not sure if Spring Boot exposes anything for that. But for sure you could stop the listeners (assuming they are attached to a `Lifecycle` - they are if you use Spring Integration) before sending the message. 
solution: 

issue: I think if you set that property, send the message and then call `ApplicationContext#start()` it will start the listener and scoop up the message You probably need to call `ApplicationContext#stop()` to return to the initial state. Or something more precise with the listener container itself. 
solution: 

issue: You maybe have a `@SpringBootTest` in the same package as the autoconfig class? Then it would be picked up in a component scan before the property source is available 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona spring-bom is the parent of my bom, and this morning I get "can't find the jetty-bom" error:````Downloaded: https://repository.nemesis.io/artifactory/libs-snapshot/org/springframework/spring-framework-bom/5.0.2.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/maven-metadata.xml (810 B at 1.6 kB/s)Downloaded: https://repository.nemesis.io/artifactory/libs-snapshot/org/springframework/spring-framework-bom/5.0.2.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/maven-metadata.xml (810 B at 1.0 kB/s) 
solution: 

issue: I suppose I have to include an XML file somewhere to configure the JNDI datasource, but I couldn't find documentation about this. I've just found tutorials on how to change sources, but I'd like the same app to run within an external/embedded container both. 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll I just want the same sources to be able to run via `mvn spring-boot:run` and also deployed on WildFly. 
solution: 

issue: I just need to expose a setter or do I need a getter as well? for the mapping to work, I mean it's just a String (Boot 1.5.9) I'll try that, thanks for the suggestion 1 setter seems sufficient, thanks @wilkinsona String 
solution: 

issue: Is there a way to deprecate a property that has moved into another prefix? What should I use in the getter for the stuff to work, or is it enough to just add the `DeprecatedConfigurationProperty`?
solution: @DeprecatedConfigurationProperty on the getter should be sufficient. That will cause the annotation processor to note that the property is deprecated in the metadata that's consumed by IDEs.

issue: Not really sure what you mean You could use Spring MVC, or whatever you like. 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll I resolved my issue when i reverted all commits to date where everything worked. I'm currently going step by step. That might be possible, I got a little help of a colleague of mine and he has a lot more knowledge about that. hm, that's what I thought... 
solution:

issue: (but don’t wait for that is what I am asking, try `2.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT`) 
solution: 

issue: I see there's an issue open on this already... https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-hateoas/issues/292 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll ive updated our cache configuration to use spring-hazelcast instances.  and i see the CacheMeterBinderProviderConfiguration pick up the HazelcastCache object:    ```CacheMeterBinderProvidersConfiguration.HazelcastCacheMeterBinderProviderConfiguration matched:      - @ConditionalOnClass found required classes 'com.hazelcast.spring.cache.HazelcastCache', 'com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast'; @ConditionalOnMissingClass did not find unwanted class (OnClassCondition)``` but i still dont see any cache metrics bring gathered under the metrics endpoint still on the latest BUILD_SNAPSHOT 
solution: 

issue: @ThreeToes  Thanks for your answer. It is more manual work then. I was hoping for something already in the framework, but I agree that it is something that should not be configurable. 
solution: 

issue: the copy/paste is to avoid creating  yet another module from where we can use this feature. The diff is an oversight, obviously I am not following There is a reason this is in two different places if that’s what you’re asking Indeed 
solution: 

issue: Hello everyone, I found this StackOverflow question where somebody says that this usage of NativeWebRequest is not thread-safe. Now I'm a bit worried because I want to do the same thing. Is that user correct? [<-LINK->]solution:
solution: It is thread-safe. Spring controllers are indeed singletons (by default) that are called concurrently by multiple threads. But the request which is injected in the controller is not actually an HTTP request. BTW, at the time the controller is constructed, the server hasn't received any request yet. The request is in fact a proxy, which, whenever one of its methods is called, finds the current request being processed (by the current thread), and delegates to that request.

issue: do i need to do something special for cache to work in tests? 
solution: That question is too vague to get any concrete answer. but if you need one, no.. 

issue: @snicoll I don't think I can. There's a lot of company sensitive code that I'd have to include to get something running 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll Not your fault! I'll have to try and struggle through this on my own 
solution: 

issue: Hi, does it make sense to use ```@Transactional``` in spring boot tests that run an actual web server (with ```@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)```) ?What I can see is that the transaction is not rolled back 
solution: 

issue: Hello, a small question concerning the new MetricsEndpoint in version 2.0.0.M7. Is there a particular reason that the response objects (ListNamesResponse, MetricResponse) have package-private modifier while other Endpoints have public modifiers? 
solution: 

issue: @mgargadennec Can you please open an issue? 
solution: Yes, I can. 

issue: the same exception (No converter found capable of converting from type [java.lang.String] to type [@javax.validation.constraints.NotNull xxxx.ImfMessage]] ) and the same behavior  - works locally but fails in CF 
solution: 

issue: yes, it's unrelated to /env, but symptoms as the same.. , should I open the new issue then ? 
solution: Probably better to establish if it's actually an issue or not. But up to you.. 

issue: And is that class and that bean registered at runtime? If I were you I'd poke around a bit to try and work out why it broke. 
solution: 

issue: ok, I'll try, but chances are that Converter is not there ... and the fact that is working as expected locally makes me think that it has something to do with CF which I can't figure out .. 
solution: Well, precisely.. 

issue: I'd like to contribute to this project since  i've been using SB for the last few years and i think it is great. Any issues you could recommend (relatively easy since it would be my first)? thanks 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll Hmm I the issue #11420 doesn't tell about reactive or not. When using a servlet application I see the auth  failure events ; for reactive application not. While debugging the reactive application the `publishEvent()` isn't called on the application context....And while digging through the spring security reactive WebFilter sources I can't see any call to it.... 
solution: 

issue: @thecodejunkie if you package your application as a jar, devtools is not repackaged with it and is not running. So unless you're running your app using maven/gradle in your docker container, you don't need to disable it, it's already the case. 
solution: 

issue: If I've setup my pom to not exclude the devtools and start my docker container using`ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-server", "-Xms4g", "-Xmx4g", "-XX:+UseG1GC", "-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=100", "-XX:+UseStringDeduplication", "-jar", "app.jar"]` then I can use the RemoteSpringApplication thing, to connect to my application instance and do live reloads however if I remove `<excludeDevtools>false</excludeDevtools>` from my pom then I get a 404 when I try and do the live reload same if I do`["java", "-Xdebug", "-Xrunjdwp:server=y,transport=dt_socket,suspend=n", "-jar", "app.jar"]` then I can connect a debugger to it my application running in the container 
solution: 

issue: If you run it from the jar there is 0% chance of devtools being activated 
solution: That. 

issue: That is a feature I am not sure I am following, sorry 
solution: 

issue: ```2018-01-12 09:53:48.982  INFO 34413 --- [           main] o.s.b.devtools.RemoteSpringApplication   : Starting RemoteSpringApplication v1.5.9.RELEASE on MacBook-Pro with PID 34413 (/Users/andreas/.m2/repository/org/springframework/boot/spring-boot-devtools/1.5.9.RELEASE/spring-boot-devtools-1.5.9.RELEASE.jar started by andreas in /Users/andreas/Dropbox/Development/Playgrounds/Stack/leo-service-hello-java)2018-01-12 09:53:48.986  INFO 34413 --- [           main] o.s.b.devtools.RemoteSpringApplication   : No active profile set, falling back to default profiles: default2018-01-12 09:53:49.018  INFO 34413 --- [           main] s.c.a.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext : Refreshing org.springframework.context.annotation.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext@7f552bd3: startup date [Fri Jan 12 09:53:49 CET 2018]; root of context hierarchy2018-01-12 09:53:49.484  WARN 34413 --- [           main] o.s.b.d.r.c.RemoteClientConfiguration    : The connection to http://localhost:4000 is insecure.

solution: 

issue: I vaguely remember that there is an organization on github, the items inside are spring related examples, but I do not remember the address, could someone give me some hints? 
solution: 

issue: @maskleo https://github.com/spring-guides/ or https://spring.io/guides to see only the live ones 
solution: So anyway, you have devtools on your classpath. You’ve added a property that enables a feature. What is the problem?. 

issue: Just interested. Why would anyone want to use a docker container for running an app at dev time? If you have an IDE, for sure you have a JVM. 
solution: Probably better to ask in spring-security channel then. 

issue: @dsyer we have reviewed that article actually. There are quite a lot of mistakes in the sample and @bclozel has submitted a PR a while back but it wasn’t merged :( 
solution: 

issue: Hello, is there anyway to catch exception that throw from controller. I tried following code, but still not working:controllerAdvice file:```java@ExceptionHandler(BusinessException.class)    public ResponseEntity businessException(final BusinessException e) {        return ResponseEntity.status(403).body('no permission');    }```controller file```java@RequestMapping('/test')public void test() {  throw new BusinessException();}```The result is controllerAdvice has been invoked, but not get my expected result:```json{    "timestamp": 1515751322930,    "status": 500,    "error": "Internal Server Error",    "exception": "com.gnet.business.exception.BusinessException",    "message": "Gone",    "path": "/api/v2/dicts"}```myExpected result with http status 403 and the body:```textno permission``` 
solution: 

issue: I want my API to respond with 401 when the user is not logged in I appreciate this isn't the security gitter, but my setup is very basic ```httpSecurity.cors().disable()                .authorizeRequests()                .antMatchers("/**").authenticated()```

issue: actually this looks like its a regression in Eclipse itself.  any idea if they have a gitter or a bug report location? found it.. 
solution: 

issue: any knowledge of why `mockRestServiceServer.verify()` is not failing my test? @dsyer best I can do is give a snippet of the test. hm. ok. I'll try to get a sample project going, but doubt I'll be able to. [![Screenshot 2018-01-12 10.19.31.png](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/tiqX/thumb/Screenshot-2018-01-12-10.19.31.png)](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/tiqX/Screenshot-2018-01-12-10.19.31.png) oh it finally uploaded. Yes. 
solution: 

issue: Nope, sorry. If you can push a sample to github that would probably help. @WhatAKitty same advice to you: publish your code in github You already did that. It looked fine. If you can't provide runnable code, no-one is going to be able to guess the missing pieces. It seems like you probably called verify() in a background thread or something. The exception was not handled by the main thread. 
solution: 

issue: @dsyer Thanks for your reply, I got the reason a few minutes ago. It's the wrong code in exceptionhandler method caused that error. But why the last error I got is from the controller method that throw ? 
solution: It makes some of confusing, may be showing the correct exception is better?. 

issue: The rest template calls happen right next to each other. I only set the mock server to expect 1 of them. Both of the resttemplate calls happen on a different thread, but they finish before the `.verify()` is called. shouldn't the verify fail? From debugging through verify it seems that it doesn't actually verify the number of calls, it just verifies the expectations I provided. `AbstractRequestExpectationManager#verify` should check the count of actual calls. ``` @Override public void verify() {  if (getExpectations().isEmpty()) {   return;  }  int count = 0;  for (RequestExpectation expectation : getExpectations()) {   if (!expectation.isSatisfied()) {    count++;   }  }  if (count > 0) {   String message = "Further request(s) expected leaving " + count + " unsatisfied expectation(s).\n";   throw new AssertionError(message + getRequestDetails());  } }``` all it does is check that the single expectation I passed ```requestTo(allOf(                startsWith("http://localhost:9008/workforceUsers"),                endsWith("/authorities/CAN_BE_ASSIGNED_AS_LOAN_OFFICER/userAssociations")))```succeeded, and not that the `once()` was true. 
solution: 

issue: and I'm getting an assertion error from somewhere else in the mockserver code. 
solution: 

issue: Not sure. You're not really providing much data. I think the verify() shut the mock server down, and then you called it in a background thread. 
solution: 

issue: is this the right place to talk about mockMvc and JSON value assertion I am having trouble using Matchers.is("json_value") with jsonPath(). 
solution: 

issue: i found  the answer. tk 
solution: 

issue: I don’t know what that druid starter is doing and it is not maintained in the core. Perhaps they have a support forum? 
solution: 

issue: OK,I found that project's github address.I will follow up on this issue. 
solution: 

issue: i need a good starting point for an springboot REST api backend and an angular2 web UI frontend. Any tips ? 
solution: https://github.com/dsyer/spring-boot-angular. Matt Raible has a lot of samples as well. Tanx..yeap...new frontier. 

issue: hopefully at some point we'll we bable to do something like ``` args.when( "exit", () -> ...``` don't think it's worth asking for though, given the loud JEP for extending switch although maybe it is, not sure that new stuff will work on a collection... 
solution: 

issue: It's easier to run the Spring Boot app on the host, really. But remote debugging isn't hard Or you could run the IDE in the VM I guess The question is really, "why"? 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I just tried to generate a new spring boot project to play with webflux (using https://start.spring.io/). The resulting pom is the following:```<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd"> <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion> <groupId>com.example</groupId> <artifactId>demo</artifactId> <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version> <packaging>jar</packaging> <name>demo</name> <description>Demo project for Spring Boot</description> <parent>  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>  <version>2.0.0.M7</version>  <relativePath/> <!-- lookup parent from repository --> </parent> <properties>  <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>  <project.reporting.outputEncoding>UTF-8</project.reporting.outputEncoding>  <java.version>1.8</java.version> </properties> <dependencies>  <dependency>   <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>   <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-webflux</artifactId>  </dependency>  <dependency>   <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>   <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>   <scope>test</scope>  </dependency>  <dependency>   <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>   <artifactId>reactor-test</artifactId>   <scope>test</scope>  </dependency> </dependencies> <build>  <plugins>   <plugin>    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>    <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>   </plugin>  </plugins> </build> <repositories>  <repository>   <id>spring-snapshots</id>   <name>Spring Snapshots</name>   <url>https://repo.spring.io/snapshot</url>   <snapshots>    <enabled>true</enabled>   </snapshots>  </repository>  <repository>   <id>spring-milestones</id>   <name>Spring Milestones</name>   <url>https://repo.spring.io/milestone</url>   <snapshots>    <enabled>false</enabled>   </snapshots>  </repository> </repositories> <pluginRepositories>  <pluginRepository>   <id>spring-snapshots</id>   <name>Spring Snapshots</name>   <url>https://repo.spring.io/snapshot</url>   <snapshots>    <enabled>true</enabled>   </snapshots>  </pluginRepository>  <pluginRepository>   <id>spring-milestones</id>   <name>Spring Milestones</name>   <url>https://repo.spring.io/milestone</url>   <snapshots>    <enabled>false</enabled>   </snapshots>  </pluginRepository> </pluginRepositories></project>```When I run `./mvnw clean package` I get the following error:```java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/springframework/boot/context/properties/source/ConfigurationPropertySource```Any clues on what could be wrong? 
solution: It's in `spring-web`, which is a dependency of `spring-boot-starter-web`. Here you've overridden `spring-web` with a very old Spring Framework version. That's the source of your problem.

issue: Another issue with the webflux setup is: `org.springframework.web.reactive.function.UnsupportedMediaTypeException: Content type 'application/json' not supported`. Do I have to include any extra starters to have support for JSON serialization? 
solution: 

issue: `validator.validate(Object, Errors)`? In a Spring Boot app the validator is autowirable, I think So you just use its API That's `org.springframework.validation.Validator` Actually the question was unclear wasn't it? You said "webflux" and then linked to a SO question on functional handlers (not the same thing) 
solution: 

issue: And, just to be clear, that only applies to the functional model. If you’re using WebFlux with `@Controller`, `@RequestMapping` etc, I believe validation can be used as it is with Spring MVC 
solution: Yes. 

issue: @orestis_f_twitter a bit hard to say with this sample, but I guess you should compose `thenMany` with a `map` operator that uses the object mapper. Right now your composition chain does not return a `Flux< BaseSocketMessage >` but most probably a `Mono<Void>` that signals when the work is done. Also, `doOnNext` is a side-effect operator and you're not supposed to call I/O operations in it. @orestis_f_twitter also, please stop cross-posting here and in the reactor channel. 
solution: 

issue: @bclozel thanks! Why cross-posting is bad? There is a (mostly) different set of people on those two channels and my question involved Spring and Reactor Anyway I will refrain from doing it again 
solution: 

issue: @james-mcgivern I get what you say about Entity as service issue, but I think this is up to the developer to choose and avoid such pitfall but there is plenty of times where this can be just fine. When developing a single tool that does just few things I tend to run with it. If I know that I will need integrations and this is going to be part of a bigger infrastructure I will avoid it like the plague! So, like you said not much spring-boot related issue in my opinion. Agreed 
solution: 

issue: Hi, any good reason I should avoid logback 1.2.3 on Spring boot 1.5.9? I am adding https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.logstash.logback/logstash-logback-encoder/4.11 dependency... in my project 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll  yes, missing type when it is `String[]` 
solution: 

issue: Hi, should `server.tomcat.accesslog.*` configuration be applied when running webflux on tomcat? 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona I'm using M7. I will give snapshot a spin. Thanks! 
solution: I think this issue should have fixed it: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/11500. 

issue: Trying to migrate an existing app (currently running on 1.5.8) to 2.0.0.M7.. has anything that I should be aware of changed in SpringApplicationBuilder? Getting a NoSuchMethodError for it. 
solution: 

issue: It should be obvious from the stack trace what code needs to change

issue: thanks @wilkinsona , it probably should be obvious, but I've been struggling with this for some time now :/ is it anything to do with the way that I'm starting my application? SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args); sure can 15:38:06.792 [main] ERROR org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication - Application startup failedjava.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.springframework.boot.builder.SpringApplicationBuilder.<init>([Ljava/lang/Object;)V at org.springframework.cloud.bootstrap.BootstrapApplicationListener.bootstrapServiceContext(BootstrapApplicationListener.java:157) ~[spring-cloud-context-1.2.0.RELEASE.jar:1.2.0.RELEASE] at org.springframework.cloud.bootstrap.BootstrapApplicationListener.onApplicationEvent(BootstrapApplicationListener.java:98) ~[spring-cloud-context-1.2.0.RELEASE.jar:1.2.0.RELEASE] at org.springframework.cloud.bootstrap.BootstrapApplicationListener.onApplicationEvent(BootstrapApplicationListener.java:64) ~[spring-cloud-context-1.2.0.RELEASE.jar:1.2.0.RELEASE] at org.springframework.context.event.SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster.doInvokeListener(SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster.java:172) ~[spring-context-5.0.2.RELEASE.jar:5.0.2.RELEASE] at org.springframework.context.event.SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster.invokeListener(SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster.java:165) ~[spring-context-5.0.2.RELEASE.jar:5.0.2.RELEASE] at org.springframework.context.event.SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster.multicastEvent(SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster.java:139) ~[spring-context-5.0.2.RELEASE.jar:5.0.2.RELEASE] at org.springframework.context.event.SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster.multicastEvent(SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster.java:127) ~[spring-context-5.0.2.RELEASE.jar:5.0.2.RELEASE] at org.springframework.boot.context.event.EventPublishingRunListener.environmentPrepared(EventPublishingRunListener.java:73) ~[spring-boot-2.0.0.M7.jar:2.0.0.M7] at org.springframework.boot.SpringApplicationRunListeners.environmentPrepared(SpringApplicationRunListeners.java:54) ~[spring-boot-2.0.0.M7.jar:2.0.0.M7] at org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication.prepareEnvironment(SpringApplication.java:350) [spring-boot-2.0.0.M7.jar:2.0.0.M7] at org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication.run(SpringApplication.java:317) [spring-boot-2.0.0.M7.jar:2.0.0.M7] at org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication.run(SpringApplication.java:1245) [spring-boot-2.0.0.M7.jar:2.0.0.M7] at org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication.run(SpringApplication.java:1233) [spring-boot-2.0.0.M7.jar:2.0.0.M7] at com.myapp.chromeapi.quotes.Application.main(Application.java:36) [classes/:?]Process finished with exit code 1 okay so that would be spring-cloud-context gotcha thanks guys appreciate it 
solution: 

issue: I have multi module Gradle project with the following:```configure(allprojects) { project ->    apply plugin: "java"    apply plugin: "io.spring.dependency-management"    sourceCompatibility = 1.8    repositories {        mavenCentral()    }    dependencies {        compile("org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:${dependencyManagement.importedProperties['commons-lang3.version']}")    }}```However the `commons-lang3` version resolves to `null`... should I include something else?Note that some sub modules apply the boot plugin as well, but not all of them. 
solution: 

issue: You don’t appear to have configured anything that would provide dependency management for Commons Lang Boot 2 has dependency management for it, but that’ll only help the sub modules with the Boot plugin applied if you’re using Boot 2 and if the ordering works out in your favour 
solution: yes was afraid of that. 

issue: @josephmtinangi what do you want to audit? maybe http://www.baeldung.com/database-auditing-jpa can give you an idea/starting point 
solution: 

issue: when i deploy the app, the database is empty, so there is no credentials in the database to check againsts i would like to login with the default user and password then add an admin to the database i tried to pass the default user and password properties through cli - doesnt work either 
solution: 

issue: And it's not like I am starting a DB here... 
solution: 

issue: You  probably want to dig into this a bit more to remove what is unecessary. A one to one mapping is not a great idea as Spring Boot auto-configure things for you. 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona OK, I got more```"parallel-2@5977" daemon prio=5 tid=0x35 nid=NA waiting  java.lang.Thread.State: WAITING   at sun.misc.Unsafe.park(Unsafe.java:-1)   at java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport.parkNanos(LockSupport.java:215)   at java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer$ConditionObject.awaitNanos(AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.java:2078)   at java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor$DelayedWorkQueue.take(ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.java:1093)   at java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor$DelayedWorkQueue.take(ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.java:809)   at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.getTask(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1074)   at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1134)   at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:624)   at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)```better?

issue: hello every one, I met an issue when i try to visit /dump endpoint to my spring boot application, the error log like below:``` ```org.springframework.boot.web.support.ErrorPageFilter - Cannot forward to error page for request [/dump] as the response has already been committed. As a result, the response may have the wrong status code. If your application is running on WebSphere Application Server you may be able to resolve this problem by setting com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.invokeFlushAfterService to false``` any suggestion? I deploy my spring boot application to a tomcat server, not via a fat jar file 
solution: 

issue: Hello all, not related to Spring boot directly,  I need some pointers  for a Subscription and billing library. 
solution: 

issue: ah. already had the repo in my build.gradle but missed the version. the wiki should mention the correct version string. thanks 
solution: You shouldn’t need a version if you’re using Boot’s dependency management. 

issue: `Finchley.M5` implies you are using Boot 2.0.0.M7 
solution: There was no properties migrator in M7. 

issue: I want to have the `spark.app-args` set like so: "--brokers" "192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2" "--partitions" "0,1,2"but it is passed like so "--brokers" "192.168.1.1" "192.168.1.2" "--partitions" "0" "1" "2" 
solution: 

issue: > You could set `spark.app-args[0]=--brokers`, `spark.app-args[1]=192.168.1.1,192.168.1.2`, ...I didn't think of this one.  `app.my-composed-task-spark-cluster.app.spark-cluster.spark.appArgs=` is where I am setting the values.  I will try! Thank you! Only if I knew if `app.composed-task-runner.composed-task-properties` can have multiple properties set... for now it seems I can only set only one.```app.composed-task-runner.composed-task-properties=app.my-composed-task-spark-cluster.app.spark-cluster.spark.appArgs=--brokers,192.168.1.1,--partitions,0```

issue: Any example of spring security max sessions ? ```http.sessionManagement()      .maximumSessions(1) ```http.sessionManagement()      .maximumSessions(1)```this does not seem to work @wilkinsona Sure, my bad 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll I added `spring-boot-properties-migrator` to the classpath and I get this:````Property source 'applicationConfig: [classpath:/application.properties]': Key: spring.messages.cache-seconds  Line: 135  Reason: none````I believe the property `cache-seconds` is changed to `cache-duration`, but why does it show Reason: none? 
solution: 

issue: @peavers that looks like it would work for me, without having the benefit of your code to run. 
solution: 

issue: @ptahchiev I am not sure we have the metadata for everything yet. Thanks for the heads up, that one is weird as it should give you a replacement @ptahchiev got it. There is a replacement but the type doesn’t match  (we have a `long` to `Duration`). Perhaps I should relax this a bit but it might  crash your app if we start renaming incompatible properties so I am not  too keen doing that. I think that  we should improve the error message to states that there is a replacement and that the type is incompatible 
solution: 

issue: @ptahchiev thanks again that’s super helpful. I’ve created https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/11794 - I’ll do my best to fix it in time for RC1 but I am not  sure I’ll have enough cycle. 
solution: 

issue: does anyone know if out of the box, the AcceptHeaderLocaleResolver supports language codes that are formatted like es-US and es_US?  it seems like it only supports es_US format, but i just want to make sure there isnt a simple configuration i can update to support both formats before writing my own converter

solution: 

issue: Has anybody been able to get `RequestBodyAdviceAdapter` to work? The component seems to be ignored and never invoked. Also the doc has what is probably a copy-paste error in it(https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/method/annotation/RequestBodyAdviceAdapter.html says it is a good starting point for ResponseBodyAdvice). 
solution: 

issue: is anybody aware of an issue with PATCH mappings and webflux?  i can PUT a Flux<MyObject> but i can't PATCH a Flux<MyObject>.  non-reactive types work on PATCH, but i can't seem to get it to accept a flux as a parameter 
solution: 

issue: I am not sure extending the standard extension is a great idea anyway why?

solution: @HaVonTe1 if you’re still there, can you edit your comment to explain why exposing the full details is a problem?. 

issue: > Have you read the docs for auto-reconnect? Its use is not recommendedCan you please point me to this 
solution: Showing some willingness to find answers yourself will also be appreciated. I’ve hopefully pointed you in the right direction. If you have specific questions, then please ask but I don’t have time to Google things on your behalf.. 

issue: ah ok. yes the devop guy in charge of configuring the docker and sensu stuff refused to make different curl statements for sb1.5 and sb2.0 
solution: 

issue: yes. but the old 1.5 services accept requests without authorization the new 2.0 dont i tried to explain that. but i got a lot of raised eyebrows and so on for upgrading to 2.0 this early. when i change the behaviour of the old services the checks will break when i adapt 1.5 to only allow secured access to health then the sensu and docker checks will fail with 401 instead of a short health report 
solution: To be clear, I am looking for an argument for reconsidering this change and “not being able to pass the credentials” isn’t one of them. 

issue: ok. fine for me so far. i will give the idea a shot of implementing my own /status endpoint 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll I've added the `spring-boot-properties-migrator` and it shows this error:````Property source 'applicationConfig: [classpath:/application.properties]': Key: spring.mobile.devicedelegatingviewresolver.enabled  Line: 142  Spring Mobile support is no longer available.

solution: 

issue: @mougias it looks like you are a good candidate for testing the new RabbitMQ metrics introduced in RC1. Please let us know if something is not working for you 
solution: 

issue: is there any documentation available for the new reactive web error exception handlers in the `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.reactive.error` package? 
solution: 

issue: just like Spring MVC, there's a dedicated support in Spring Boot (error pages handling) and the out-of-the-box support provided by Framework: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#webflux-ann-controller-adviceSo yes, the infrastructure provided by Framework is perfectly valid 
solution: 

issue: Hey just upgrading from 2.0.0.M4 to RC1 and my endpoints are now all 404'ing . It seems the `@RestController` now requires `@RequestMapping` on the class level where it did not before? In my case I have `@RequestMapping` only specified on the methods themselves. Well, I have lots of 404s which only get fixed when I add `@RequestMapping` at the class level with an appropriate prefix I am also using `server.servlet.context-path=/sdp` if that helps Perhaps a combination of the two is at issue. I've just glanced across https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.0-Migration-Guide and can't spot anything obvious, hence the experimentation. 
solution: 

issue: We have that in lots of our samples and they work as expected 
solution: 

issue: Hmm, I'm convincing myself rapidly that I agree with @wilkinsona  - there is something /else/ going on 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I just finished upgrading my project to 2.0.0.RC1 without problems (from 2.0.0.M7), but I have a question : is there a particular reason that the micrometer `ClassLoaderMetrics` is not added in `MeterBindersConfiguration` for actuator ? 
solution: 

issue: Thanks @wilkinsona ! It's not a big deal since adding the MeterBinder as a bean correctly records metrics but i'm curious :-) . Thank you all in the springboot team for your hard work !

issue: guys, about 7 months ago I opened this issue: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/9548 .... which was resolved in both 1.5.5 and 2.0 branches I recently tried testing the provided sample project and the test fails did it got broken again? works fine with any of the 1.5.x  branches but with 2.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT it faisl *fails 
solution: 

issue: @ptahchiev I’m not really sure how you expect that to work then. Even if it were possible, it wouldn’t be a good idea for us to modify your custom configuration behind your back @wathek The `ContextRefreshedEvent` is published once the application context has been refreshed, but before the embedded container is started 
solution: So one option would be to listen for that. Another would be to use `@PostConstruct` on a bean and perform some logic there. Which is better depends on what you want to do.. 

issue: oh ok @wilkinsona maybe I can explain a bit more my problem I'm trying to use GraphQL with Spring (I'm using graphql-java and trying to understand what graphql-java-tools does) did you already used graphql-java ?

solution: 

issue: The process of reporting a new CVE starts there. Or you can contact the team members directly if you prefer. It all ends up in the same hopper Not sure what you mean by "patch". We don't work with literal patches. Just new releases. Do you have a proposal for a code change? For a new vulnerability?

solution: 

issue: What I'm doing is setting profiles like region, and stack in EC2. So what I expect is that for all things in a region, I can set a property, and all things in a certain stack, I can set a property. But for apps both in a region AND stack, I want a different property. The way this behaves with the OR semantics is pretty confusing. It just ends up depending on the order the properties are defined in the file, which doesn't feel quite right. Any strong use case for the OR behavior that I may not be seeing?

solution: 

issue: That’s right. It should just work. `spring-boot-starter-jersey` and `spring-boot-starter-actuator` should give you what you need 
solution: 

issue: I think that may be an oversight in Spring Data Elasticsearch. I don’t think it needs all of Elasticsearch on the classpath

issue: Hello ! Trying to upgrade project from `1.5.9 - > 2.0.0.RC1` and got exciting message in integration test```Failed to bind properties under 'spring.jackson.deserialization' to java.util.Map<com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.DeserializationFeature, java.lang.Boolean>...Caused by: org.springframework.core.convert.ConverterNotFoundException: No converter found capable of converting from type [java.lang.String] to type [java.util.Map<com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.DeserializationFeature, java.lang.Boolean>]```Could someone point me at right direction, where to dig to fix this stuff ? 
solution: 

issue: we've tightened the rules for configuration properties (see here: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.0-Migration-Guide#externalized-configuration). Maybe your `application.properties` or `application.yml` has a property related to jackson that's not mapped well with the new constraints? 
solution: 

issue: Jackson actually uses CAPS_CASE 
solution: 

issue: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: [10:java.math.BigDecimal] is not a supported property value. I am getting this exception after upgrading to neo4j 3.2.9 using spring data for neo4j. Any idea how to resolve BigDecimal issue in spring boot 2.0.0.M7 ? 
solution: Somehow that `application.yml` worked with previous version of spring boot so solution was to property format `application.yml`. 

issue: @artjomka It’s an improvement in the new binder that means it catches more configuration problems. The old one was unhelpfully ignoring your two deserialization settings without telling you there was a problem

issue: Has anyone used jtds driver to communicate to sqlserver with springboot. In my case application is throwing errror stating communication error but sqlserver management studio is able to connect to database. Note my db is on some other remote machine. Its very weired. 
solution: 

issue: @Mocked ElasticsearchTemplate elasticsearchTemplate is not working after upgrading to spring boot 2.0.0M7 from spring boot 1.5 ? 
solution: 

issue: I hope it's okay to ask a somewhat more generic spring question here. Is @Order supposed to work with @AliasFor (in a meta-annotation)? According to my tests Spring sees the @Order meta-annotation, but I can't get it to pick up the value I'd like to provide via @AliasFor afaics it uses AnnotationUtils.findAnnotation(type, Order.class); to read the annotation (in OrderUtils.getOrder), and if I'm not reading the docs wrong @AliasFor should work there.. but I'm really not sure 
solution: So it's probably working as designed. There is a performance penalty to use the alias mechanism, so we don't always choose to pay it..

issue: @wilkinsona Well not really. If my tomcat configuration would have been mismatch or with some error, my other app would not have worked which manually connects to the same datasource. Currently, my boot app is struggling to communicate to the datasource exposed in jndi. also i have given the same jndi name as my other app has given. I am struggling to debug the cause.

issue: Hi QQ, is there a way to configure the thread pools for netty/reactor in spring webflux? I would like to reduce the request queuing [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/A3H3/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/A3H3/image.png) is the green area on this chart, reported by New Relic 
solution: 

issue: @FcoJavierSainz Reactor Netty uses an event loop with a small number of threads that’s tied to the number of processor cores. Configuring the number of threads is far more unusual than it was with a blocking servlet container. If you do want to configure it, you can use a `NettyServerCustomizer` bean 
solution: 

issue: Thanks. I see the problem. It’s the `MeterRegistryPostProcessor` that’s triggering it. A `MeterRegistry` is created before the `WebServer` has been created. The creation of the `MeterRegistry` triggers the initialization of all `MeterBinder` beans so that they can be bound to the registry. 
solution: 

issue: Hello; in Spring Boot 1.5.9: do I understand correctly that the `ignoreUnknownFields` property of `@ConfigurationProperties` cannot be controlled programmatically? Perhaps by extending `PropertiesConfigurationFactory` or customizing/injecting the data-binder in some way? 
solution: 

issue: So in theory if I created an abstract class which  holds all the dependencies of all the controllers  with `@MockBean` on them, and then my all `@WebMvcTest` extends that class I could achieve test application context caching and actually be able to test APIs. However this is like a hacky scary ugly workaround 
solution: 

issue: But is there any alternative to  the `@MockBean` together with `@WebMvcTest`? If I don't use it I will hit the `NoSuchBeanDefinitionException` on the first controller dependency. I see that almost all the examples of use `@WebMvcTest` are together with `@MockBean`.Another alternative is to run those tests in parallel, however this will make the config a bit more complicated.

issue: (ignore my previous message, that's the raw http content before decompression) Are you using Spring Boot SNAPSHOTs? 
solution: 

issue: It's strange, I'm consistently getting valid JSON arrays as responses using both Spring Boot snapshots with the stable reactor-netty or snapshots as well 
solution: 

issue: Thanks @cHullaert so API works fine, its just in failure scenario when it tries to handle Exception to map to http status code using @RestControllerAdvice it fails to return error response in xml format 
solution: 

issue: I have a problem this is my source code: https://github.com/donhuvy/sample_boot this is error [![Screen Shot 2018-02-15 at 09.07.25.png](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/yrM4/thumb/Screen-Shot-2018-02-15-at-09.07.25.png)](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/yrM4/Screen-Shot-2018-02-15-at-09.07.25.png) I want display value of model to view, but it doesn't work. Please help me, make it work 
solution: 

issue: @donhuvy what template engine are you using? 
solution: I use Thymeleaf. 

issue: i am not so familiar with thymeleaf but 1 thing you can check while waiting for an answer is whether you put in the tags correctly. did you enable Thymeleaf because it seems that those tags are not being interpreted as tags at all 
solution: 

issue: Does anyone know why Spring HATEOAS is missing the hostname if I use it on netty/webflux? I just end up with ```"_links": {        "self": {            "href": "/customers/e1e6c00f-dec2-48af-ac0e-063a5153f6d6"        }    },``` (Using Spring Boot 2.0.0.RC1) @olivergierke Maybe? @wilkinsona Oh no :-( 
solution: 

issue: I think so, it'll just take a while. Appreciate the help! 
solution: 

issue: I try to setting like this https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1328316/36290531-4d814330-12f8-11e8-8d83-4476f2227fca.png , but issue still happen 
solution: 

issue: No, it’s the original jar before it’s repackaged into a fat jar that is runnable 
solution: 

issue: That is a start. However, it still does not solve the issue of missing META-INF/spring.factories from the non-repackaged jar. 
solution: You haven’t really described that part of the problem. What’s the failure you’re seeing?. Also, exactly how are you creating the dependencies jar? Have you done anything to merge together the `META-INF/spring.factories` from the various dependencies?. 

issue: Thanks for pointing me in the right direction. It seems that there are few issues that aren’t actively being worked on. I will fork the repo and see what issues have solutions that I can work on! Will be sure to notify you, @wilkinsona when I have doubts to be clarified! 
solution: 

issue: is it just me or the spring oauth2 documentation is outdated ? I have been stuck in setting up a OAuth2 with spring-boot 2.0.0.RC1 and currently I still get an error saying that AuthenticationManager cannot be autowired since there are no beans with that type 
solution: 

issue: Error:(168, 30) java: diamond operator is not supported in -source 1.5  (use -source 7 or higher to enable diamond operator) 
solution: 

issue: that's what I said - supporting that with the existing features might not work / not make sense at all. 
solution: 

issue: Just upgraded from Boot M7 to Boot RC1 running with Tomcat and now static css/js living in `classpath:/resources/static`throw `405` when a client tries to load the view (only raw html gets loaded).If I change mapping in the MVC controller from:```@Controllerclass FileUploadController {    @GetMapping("files")    fun getUploadPage(): ModelAndView {    //...    }}```to:```@Controller@RequestMapping("files")class FileUploadController {    @GetMapping    fun getUploadPage(): ModelAndView {    //...    }}```Then static resources return to the client a 404 instead of a 405. Is there anything I'm missing? Resources used to load fine with M7. 
solution: I can’t see why the change you’ve described would change a static resource response from 405 to 404, but it’s hard to know what’s going on from a handful of lines of code. Can you share a complete, minimal example that reproduces the problem?. 

issue: With first example (the one returning a 405) Boot logs ```o.s.web.servlet.PageNotFound             : Request method 'GET' not supported```Second one (404) however logs```o.s.web.servlet.PageNotFound             : No mapping found for HTTP request with URI [/css/style.css] in DispatcherServlet with name 'dispatcherServlet'``` 
solution: Can you share a complete, minimal example that reproduces the problem?. 

issue: prior to that you have to put @Autowired on the constructor itself, not the member 
solution: 

issue: I’m not sure why it should make any difference, unless, as Dave suspects, and unwanted proxy has got involved. It doesn’t make any difference to our tests if I add `@Transactional`

issue: I have a problem with Hibernate SessionFactory, it works ok with Spring Boot 1.5.10.RELEASE, but error happen when upgrade to Spring Boot 2.0.0.RC1 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48876402/beaninstantiationexception-failed-to-instantiate-org-hibernate-sessionfactory Please help me! 
solution: 

issue: No, I don't mess with lifecycle explicitly, maybe Kotlin does, I will make minimal project to reproduce the problem 
solution: 

issue: Have you read the docs? https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-configure-hibernate-naming-strategy 
solution: yes, i did, but could not find the exact meaning out of it.. if columns are generated as database first approach, then @column should be enough to supply the name of the column.. 

issue: I dont get why my entity is throwing exception, column next_val not found even after i did set ``` ```spring:    jpa:     hibernate:      naming:        physical-strategy: org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.PhysicalNamingStrategyStandardImpl``` ok. how to tell hibernate not to do that and use @column value 
solution: 

issue: @dsyer https://gitlab.com/AleksandrSl/spring-sandbox/tree/master/  - minimal example to reproduce datasource configuration error 
solution: I don’t believe you can. 

issue: @AleksandSl28_twitter looks like a Kotlin tooling problem to me. I guess we might have to ask @snicoll to confirm that. `mvn compile spring-boot:run` works for me But I would expect not to have to add that `compile` step (it works that way for Java projects) 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I'm using https://github.com/openshift/openshift-restclient-java in a `@Service` and it seems that this lib prevents the close of my application. It uses OkHttpClient under the cover I think. Can I somehow force destroy a `@Service` during shutdown? 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona So something like `"OkHttp Dispatcher" #417 prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x00007fe1a47d1800 nid=0x3f2b waiting on condition [0x00007fe0f88c8000]`? 
solution: 

issue: I've inherited some code that uses something like `@Autowired initSomeSingleton(ApplicationContext ctx, SomeBean bean) {... }` inside a `@Configuration` class (`SomeBean` is defined in the _same_ class). I ran into issues of `initSomeSingleton` not being run (worked if `initSomeSingletone` was moved to a separate `@Configuration` class), and was wondering;A) Is it generally ok to use `@Autowired` for the side-effects like thisB) Would it make more sense to setup an `@EventListener` on the `ApplicationReadyEvent` in a separate component that `@Autowired`s in `SomeBean`? 
solution: 

issue: did any one get this error after migrating to version 2.0.0.RC2 of spring boot ```BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'configurationPropertiesBeans' defined in org.springframework.cloud.autoconfigure.ConfigurationPropertiesRebinderAutoConfiguration: Bean instantiation via factory method failed; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.BeanInstantiationException: Failed to instantiate [org.springframework.cloud.context.properties.ConfigurationPropertiesBeans]: Factory method 'configurationPropertiesBeans' threw exception; nested exception is java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: BINDER_BEAN_NAME``` 
solution: You need to use Spring Cloud Finchley snapshots with RC2. 

issue: Is this issue resolved with spring-boot 2.x? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47664337/logback-logs-kept-open-by-application-and-not-deleting-from-disk/47719962#47719962 
solution: 

issue: I am still seeing the issue as reported in https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/9070 with RC2. Is there any known workaround for it? 
solution: 

issue: Thanks @shakuzen Seems I was using an old version (1.3.2) of `spring-cloud-starter-hystrix` .Upgrading the same to `1.4.3.RELEASE` still results in the same issue 
solution: You shouldn’t declare versions of individual Spring Cloud dependencies. Rather, you should use the dependencies management provided by the BOM. http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/. 

issue: Guys, some artifacts are intermittently unavailable. For example: https://repo.spring.io/snapshot/org/springframework/boot/spring-boot-starter-test/2.0.0.RC2/spring-boot-starter-test-2.0.0.RC2.pom @snicoll any ideas why sometimes they are available and sometimes not? @snicoll there seems to be an issue with dependency resolution I changed repos to: 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll Thank you for responding, sir (considering the milestone release is occuring). Its fine now, I was playing around with test configurations and was unsure about whether the `spring.factories` file I had declared was being picked up: it was. Sorry to bother you! 
solution: You didn't, glad it's working fine. 

issue: Hi folks. Just upgraded our ~200k LOC business application to Spring Boot 2.0.0.RC2. Everything works. Can't await the FINAL release to deploy the application to production! 
solution: 

issue: Is there a metric that counts how many times a controller method was called? I'm almost sure that I've seen this in a SpringDeveloper video from @joshlong but can't find it again. 
solution: 

issue: I ran it in debug, but I'm not wiser :)`org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCurrentlyInCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'translationStringToSpecificationStatusEnumConverter': Requested bean is currently in creation: Is there an unresolvable circular reference?` 
solution: If you look up and down the stack trace you should hopefully be able to see what was going on. 

issue: Wondering if there is any reason why `matchIfMissing = true` was removed from this `@ConditionalOnProperty ` in 2.0 https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/autoconfigure/web/servlet/ServletManagementContextAutoConfiguration.java#L58

solution: 

issue: Hey everyone, I am trying to write a starter for a framework which pulls in liquibase as a dependency. However, we don't need the `LiquibaseAutoConfiguration` to kick in per default. Is there a recommended way for another starter to change the default? I know about that, but that is from the side of the user. We are providing a starter, so we can't use that 
solution: 

issue: But our framework sets up the liquibase configuration on it's own, we are not a spring based framework and we are interacting with Liquibase on our own 
solution: 

issue: Hi all, I am updating springframework.boot from 1.5.10 to the 2.0.0 release and after moved tests to mockito 2 I am now getting this annoying error about [<-CODE->], don't know how to get rid of it.
solution: Maybe you have a mixed versions of spring boot jars.

issue: for a multimodule project where the jar need not be runnable, is there a way to tell springboot not to look for mainclass ? spring-bootmaven-plugin* 
solution: 

issue: I'm trying to understand what exactly get's loaded when using `@DataJpaTest`, is that controlled by https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/v1.5.10.RELEASE/spring-boot-test-autoconfigure/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring.factories ?I'm trying to root cause why a bean, not in anyway related to the data layer, get's constructed and fails, since it in turn depends on other things, like session stuff, excluded for `@DataJpaTest`. _(at least I can't find any dependencies between the test and the bean - that happens to be a AuthService)_ Doh, turned out I had an extra `@ComponentScan` added on top of `@SpringBootApplication`, I'm guessing the `excludeFilters` maybe works in tandem with the `@DataJpaTest`?, will read on ;) 
solution: 

issue: If "Getting a notification in that order looks odd to me" was an answer to my question, could you tell me a bit more about your concerns? 
solution: It was and @wilkinsona already replied you. Fighting the semantic of the context doesn’t sound a great idea to me. 

issue: hehe, fair point. I did it mainly to isolate my web contexts (all have different jackson mappers, error handling, etc) And, this project evolved from an xml-based configuration, with the web.xml as main configuration file for the child contexts (old Spring 3.0 times, years ago...) 
solution: 

issue: Where at the `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, etc annotations? Annotations aren’t “inherited" by a class  that implements an interface so I think they may need to be on the implementing method too I think it may work if you put the mappings on the implementation 
solution: Actually, both. 

issue: But I’d just avoid the problem entirely by not using `@Async` on a controller `@Async` isn’t a web-specific concern so, IMO, it doesn’t belong on a Controller 
solution: 

issue: I have to figure out how I can store a directory of files in my project so when the jar is built, that directory is in the "root" directory, so a reference to that directory name from the code will find it. I tried creating "src/main/resources/database", but the jar ends up with "BOOT-INF/classes/database/". I can't change the directory reference to use the classpath instead, as the code that opens the directory is inside an artifact I use. 
solution: 

issue: There are some examples of how to put resources in the root of the jar there

issue: What's the latest version (RC/milestone) currently of spring-security-oauth2-boot then? I can't seem to find it on mvnrepository 
solution: 

issue: To be clear it’s not part of Spring Boot anymore (see the link above) 
solution: I know.. 

issue: It’s been removed (very recently) in 2.0 as it was no longer needed. What were you using it for?

issue: @wilkinsona thanks a lot.. let me check that 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I was following this https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-build-systems.html#using-boot-maven-without-a-parent . if i am using spring-boot-dependencies for dependency management, will I need to re declare all the jars managed by it in my project pom ? 
solution: 

issue: Probably. There's a lot of detail missing from that question.  Are you using spring-boot-starter-data-jpa? No, you do not. Unless you screwed something else up 
solution: 

issue: ok. I have a multi module project, where spring boot is dependency manager. I expect my javax.persistence annotation to work. My maven builds are failing stating it cannot find the jar is classpath 
solution: 

issue: If you are getting the wrong version or a missing jar then you did something else wrong 
solution: and in mycompany dependencies i have. 

issue: guys, I need to process items from a queue (beanstalkd) and make some requests and save the result in the database. I dont need a spring boot web for this. What should I use? spring batch, spring task, other? 
solution: 

issue: Hello guys! Question, I'm using Ehcache with my Spring boot server. Trying to setup transactional caching.According to Ehcache docs: http://www.ehcache.org/generated/2.10.4/html/ehc-all/#page/Ehcache_Documentation_Set%2Fco-tx_configuring_transactional_cache.htmlFor spring I need to implement my own: `net.sf.ehcache.transaction.manager.TransactionManagerLookup`While implementing it, I need to pass Spring's `TransactionManager` to Ehcache.I made my `TransactionManager` using `org.springframework.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager.JpaTransactionManager`.When I tried to autowire `JpaTransactionManager` inside `TransactionManagerLookup`,  and pass it to Ehcache, it complains with `cannot convert from JpaTransactionManager to javax.transaction.TransactionManager`.I found one StackOverflow question related to my problem: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28486480/injecting-platformtransactionmanager-into-ehcacheThey told him to use `JtaTransactionManager` that has a method `.getTransactionManager()`, but my whole application is configured around `JpaTransactionManager`, I can't really switch.I know, it is a very specific question. But if there is someone with some expertise about this, can you please give me an advice or some direction to go to? 
solution: 

issue: That just manages Jackson versions. It doesn’t actually include a dependency itself.  @rajjaiswalsaumya 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll maybe you are a good person to ask that (help from anybody else still appreciated)We are deploying our services on PCF and are using the platform provided services (e.g. RabbitMQ, MySQL) to bind resources to our applications.I had an application where I forgot to provide a binding to a rabbitMQ service (just forgot to update the manifest before deploying).This resulted in a "happy" startup and when trying to emit a message it just threw a runtime exception which I only later caught in the logs (it resulted in some sort of Socket timeout).Now my real questions. What would you do here if you want to prevent this "grey error"?I clearly can disable the AutoConfiguration of RabbitMQ just for the cloud profile but I somehow have the feeling that it could wreck some settings even with the AutoReconfiguration done by the BuildPack.What do you think would be the cleanest solution here?I was also thinking about verifying if the hostname is not localhost (inside the cloud-profile). Interested in hearing back from you or somebody else :) 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll in springboot 2.0.0.RC2  i use Binder to solve properties, found can not change `${spring.application.name}` to real value [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/tdMj/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/tdMj/image.png) [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/daLw/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/daLw/image.png) but other's property is ok in bootstrap.yml config file```spring:  application:    name: sample-elasticJob``` this code in springboot 1.5.x is ok but in 2.0 i change to use binder , but found invalid in value like `${spring.application.name}` spel 
solution: ```new Binder(ConfigurationPropertySources.from(environment.getPropertySources()))          .bind(targetName, Bindable.of(clazz))          .orElseThrow(              () -> new FatalBeanException("Could not bind DataSourceSettings properties"));```. 

issue: i think i read springboot 2.0 Migration doc  ```new Binder(ConfigurationPropertySources.from(propertySource))  .bind("com.foo", Bindable.of(target)))``` 
solution: I know. I am fixing it now. 

issue: @dragontree101 updated migration guide, thank you. https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.0-Migration-Guide#relaxed-binding 
solution: . 

issue: No Because the YAML is valid. It just can't be bound to the Java (which apparently happens at runtime - not unreasonably) 
solution: 

issue: well, all of them really. were holdovers from switching from maven to gradle and never updating the property reference format 
solution: 

issue: @mlk5060 yes, that should work, like `@ConditionalOnBean(value = DispatcherServlet.class, name = DEFAULT_DISPATCHER_SERVLET_BEAN_NAME)` in `DispatcherServletAutoConfiguration` for creating DispatcherServlet registration bean

issue: Amazing work done by spring team and community. Spring boot rules. And kotlin make it perfect! GJ 
solution: 

issue: Our application is already deploying to our staging environment with Spring Boot 2.0.0.RELEASE  When everything looks good, it will be in production soon When will the Harlem Shake 2.0.0.RELEASE video from Pivotal headquarter be published? :) I just stumbled across a problem with the spring-boot-maven-plugin. I have a module that contains a  ServiceLocator file under META-INF/services. The Spring Boot app declares this module as a dependency. When starting the application from within Eclipse, everything works fine. But when starting the packaged application the ServiceLocator file won't be loaded Temporarily I've copied the ServiceLocator file to the Spring Boot app, but is there another solution so that the spring-boot-maven-plugin puts the ServiceLocator file directly under META-INF/services? 
solution: 

issue: Some libraries don't work in the fat jar because of this kind of thing. Generally they broke something to do with context class loaders or URL resolution. Maybe use `requiresUnpack`? 
solution: AFAIK, the service loader mechanism just uses the ClassLoader to find `META-INF/services`. As long as the right ClassLoader is used, it should just work. For example, Log4j2 uses `META-INF/services` and it works fine in a fat jar.. 

issue: Yeah that doesn't make any sense 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona Loading a file from META-INF/services works, I think there was another problem that made me think that the service was not loaded. I've added some log statements to verify that loading the Service works correctly 
solution: 

issue: @PatrickGotthard thanks for the feedback. That confirms my suspicion that should work OOB 
solution: 

issue: @yeralin thanks, I was planning to use `EnvironmentPostProcessor` 
solution: 

issue: Hi! Congratulations on the spring boot 2.0 release, I’m looking forward to upgrade my applications. Is there a chance that spring social gets some love again? The 3.x release is in milestone stage for quite a while. Maybe it get’s a refresh for boot 2.0 and will be released? ;-) 
solution: 

issue: hi. is it possible to map only the jolokia endpoint to /jolokia instead of /actuator/jolokia ? I just wanted to move the jolokia endpoint because our monitoring is using this endpoint P.S.: startup time on my development machine decreased from ~38 (1.5.x) to 30 (2.0.0) seconds. Feels much faster when you restart the application many times a day :) 
solution: 

issue: @marcpa00 I think some GC metrics are available under the metricNames "jvm.gc.pause", "jvm.gc.memory.promoted", "jvm.gc.max.data.size" and "jvm.gc.memory.allocated" 
solution: 

issue: I’d assume that this is the serialisation incompatibility again. Spring session sadly uses java serialisation by default 
solution: 

issue: Sessions are supposed to be ephemeral. 
solution: > Don't want to call our admins out of bed when deploying around 6AM. Yeah, this needs to be prepared beforehand for sure.. 

issue: Hi, everyone! I'm having an issue associating URL patterns to some custom filters using the `FilterRegistrationBean`. I want to associate filters to endpoints with scattered path parameters, e.g. `/client/{clientId}/resource/{resourceId}/properties`. Is there any kind of wildcard that I can use for this? `/client/**/resource/**/properties` did not work, neither did a regex. Thanks! 
solution: 

issue: The former will match any Actuator Endpoint, the latter will match anything at all The explanation of what the former does is in the method’s javadoc, btw It’s in an actuator package and part of the actuator auto-configuration module so we hoped that would be enough. We prefer not to make class names too long if we can avoid it 
solution: 

issue: not unless there are other ones in other starter packages i have just one config class that extends the adapterc class, but do not specify order either so i dont redirect to login but i do get 403 forbidden 
solution: 

issue: ok. will do. and thanks for looking at it oh weird so it does work as you stated for GET only heh ahh spot on with CSRF.. that was it thanks again 
solution: 

issue: I'm writing tests for my app, but I keep getting:```UnsatisfiedDependencyException: Error creating bean with name 'userRepository':Unsatisfied dependency expressed through constructor parameter 1:Ambiguous argument values for parameter of type 
solution: 

issue: Not sure. What is the problem? 
solution: One is connected with @WithMockUser annotation and @BeforeEach function, in this case @WithMockUser on it is ignored, and @WithMockUser annotation on the @Test function is used. Exapmle - https://gitlab.com/AleksandrSl/spring-sandbox/blob/junit-5-security/src/test/kotlin/pro/parseq/springsandbox/entities/ItemSecurityTests.kt. 

issue: // @BeforeAll throws java.lang.IllegalStateException: No transactional EntityManager found @BeforeEach works perfect But since there is one test class instance, why not populate db once, on @BeforeAll Thanks! @snicoll About 'That test doesn’t need to be a `SpringBootTest`'. I thought Security will not work without it 
solution: 

issue: I am not discussing the use case here jira.spring.io/browse/SPR for that one thanks for asking 
solution: 

issue: Isn't spring.security.oauth2 supposed to be part of spring security core 5.0.3?  Since upgrading to boot2, I can't find the dependency and the documentation for spring secuity is horrible for how to add this 
solution: 

issue: I guess using Spring Boot 2 you can't use the new Oauth2 classes in Spring Security 5.0.3, even though Spring Boot uses Spring Security 5.0.3.  It doesn't make any sense I guess I will go back to Spring Boot 1.5 until Spring Boot 2 is finished. @snicoll I read the migration guide and it doesn't help.  I tried to use spring.security.oauth2 and it isn't found. 
solution: 

issue: where is a list of stuff that has not been migrated?  I upgraded to spring boot 2, added the new spring boot oauth dependency and I have none of the new features from spring security 5.0.3.  HttpSecurity.oauth2Login() errors because spring.security.oauth2 is not found.  Shouldn't be this complicated. 
solution: 

issue: Is there a "correct" way do determine at runtime if a spring-boot application ist deployed to an existing servlet-container or is using an embedded servlet-container? 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll I’m on 2.0 and I didn’t try with 1.5 
solution: @larsgrefer from the top of my head you can check if the `ApplicationContext` is a `WebServerApplicationContext`. I am sure there is a better way to figure this out. 

issue: I'm facing a problem of join I have two tables each one on a different schema (Postgresql) and I want to set in my JPA the Join field how can I tell it what schema to look for ? 
solution: 

issue: hi guys, how can I map a field in my entity to a field in a table into a different schema ? (I'm using postgresql) 
solution: 

issue: I thought you said there was only one `OAuth2RestOperations` in the `asynchronous` context? 
solution: @Holzberg I need something that I can clone (or unzip) and run. A snippet like that leaves too much chance that I won’t configure things in the same way as you have. 

issue: @mlk5060 No, `@Qualifier` is not the same as `@Primary` in that regard 
solution: I see, so I'd have to use that interface shim I mentioned above. Can you not just use `@Primary`?. 

issue: @Holzberg Not much. It confirms that basic auth is being used for the path that you’ve hit, but not much else 
solution: 

issue: Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Could not resolve placeholder 'appName' in value "${appName}" i  am getting  Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Could not resolve placeholder 'appName' in value "${appName}"  error  even after defining the  application proprieties . 
solution: 

issue: Hi there! I developed an app on Boot 2.0 starting at M7, and somewhere between RC1 and RC2, my prometheus metrics endpoint is not being exported. I think I am doing everything right (if I change back to RC1 with no other changes, the endpoint shows up again!) 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll No, that was aimed at me in response to a suggestion that I’d made (that didn’t work) 
solution: 

issue: depends on what feature you’re looking for (I know you’ve disabled restart) There is a `PropertySource` that’s added to the `Environment`, you could look for that 
solution: 

issue: so this is an edge-case that cannot be (easily) solved? 
solution: I can’t really advise on the solution without knowing exactly why the problem’s occurring. It’s usually due to one of two things:1. The code that’s creating the instance is using reflection and the wrong class loader to do so2. The application is configured such that its code is split across the two class loadersThe second one can be fixed via configuration: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-devtools-customizing-classload. 

issue: I’m happy to take a look if you can share some code that reproduces the problem 
solution: 

issue: That was redis, not mongodb I think 
solution: 

issue: After upgrading Spring Boot 2.0.0, can't import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security.oauth2.client.resource.UserInfoRestTemplateFactory 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona thanks, that works 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona is this a Spring Data issue though? From the details I can find online it seems to be on the REST layer? ok, thanks just to be clear, it is NOT exploitable on a pre 2.0.0.M4 Boot app ok and that is without any specific PATCH endpoint exposed for a Boot project not making use of SDR? ok, great thanks the CEV makes it seem like ALL Boot apps under 2.0.0M4 are exploitable regardless of making use of SDR or not, it’s not clear that it’s only the bundled version of SDR thanks for clearing this up for me 
solution: 

issue: Thanks a lot, really helpful @wilkinsona 
solution: 

issue: will do, it hit the breakpoint in my main, so that’s a plus at least ah! https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/7a88fe692d916ac4673fdeadc37f0403ac2e106c/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/SpringApplication.java#L306so it’s throwing `java.lang.IllegalStateException: Failed to load property source from location 'classpath:/application.yaml’` but it’s not ending up on any output 
solution: 

issue: Not sure if this is the right place to ask but I need to do some special  exception handling for remoting failures. Will `org.springframework.remoting.RemoteAccessException` be the top level exception returned for all remoting failures in the forseeable future? The contract seems to suggest so, but it is not 100% clear. 
solution: 

issue: @madorb Thanks, that’s what I’d expect if there’s no `logback.xml` anywhere. Sounds like that’s not the problem then. Next thing I’d try is stepping into the place where the exception’s logged 
solution: 

issue: ah, sorry, that’s just one message, real log should be coming from:`SpringApplication.reportFailure()` which checks `  if (logger.isErrorEnabled()) {` interesting. in the “stock” app the _type_ of  `logger` at `SpringApplication.reportFailure()` is:`org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory$Log4jLog`but in _my_ application it’s:`org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Jdk14Logger`not sure what that MEANS but `Jdk14Logger` definitely doesn’t seem like what i’d expect 
solution: 

issue: @jacobk there is an `ApplicationConversionService` you can use for that https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/12095 And we’re thinking of a way to make it available automatically in https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/12148 @filiphr thanks for notifying us for that dead link! We’ve moved all that doc in our own ref guide @ptahchiev can’t find the reference right now but that issue rings a bell paging @wilkinsona (he remembers everything) 
solution: 

issue: Great, let us know how it goes! You found it already? :D Why am I not surprised Thanks for the report @ptahchiev @ptahchiev I guess you mean `2.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT` (no point in being on a snapshot that isn’t updated anymore) 
solution: 

issue: @nnanda2016 You can't change the context path for WebFlux applications in Spring Boot. You can create a Spring Boot issue explaining your use case for that. 
solution: I read about EOL for Spring Boot 1 in this channel, but I can't seem to find that message. Is there something officially posted somewhere for that?. 

issue: Not this time 
solution: That NPE in the matcher rings a bell but can’t find an issue. @ptahchiev if you can build a minimal sample that we can use to reproduce the issue, that would be certainly helpful. 

issue: is there anything I need to do? (I'm still on the 2.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT) 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona  you are right.  I excluded ErrorMvcAutoConfiguration.class in @SpringBootApplication.  I did this to disable the /error html page.  Is there a way to disable that page besides excluding ErrorMvcAutoConfiguration?  I have "server.error.whitelabel.enabled = false" in application.properties, but it still maps /error 
solution: 

issue: Are `@Import` on Auto configuration classes always imported (even when the auto configuration should not be imported?). Asking about 1.5 
solution: 

issue: I disabled it to disable /error endpoint that supplies html 
solution: 

issue: It looks like there is an issue when deserialising the `testDto 
solution: 

issue: @larsgrefer  I appreciate your help, but that didn't work. I did add copyBootJar.dependsOn ':foo-bar:spring-boot-project:bootRepackage'  but that seemed to apply the repackage task to docker module. @wilkinsona I guess I need to hit the documentation and learn what it means to declare a custom configuration, add dependency, and then copy from it to my libs directory. 
solution: 

issue: @EmmanuelAdeleke What kind of request will the frontend send to your server? 
solution: 

issue: which project has RestTemplate? ``` <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>   <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>``` `Field restTemplate in spring.cloud.games.GamesController required a bean of type 'org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate' that could not be found.` 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll yes i did and i must have missed it. this is a clean project so i forgot about creating the bean thank you. i did find the answer 
solution: If you search for resttemplate in the doc, that section is the first hit. it is not apparent and its not right at the top of the doc. its like somewhere in the middle between 80 hits for the word ressttemplate >.<. 

issue: back to my first comment then :) 
solution: 

issue: Again, it is the _First_ hit when you search for resttemplate carry on 
solution: 

issue: In 1.5, it defaults to true so explicitly setting it to true won’t make any difference 
solution: I was expecting it to turn off searches to non-existent "Customizer" classes, which is referenced in issue #9873. 

issue: `Getting BeanInfo for class [org.hibernate.validator.internal.constraintvalidators.bv.NotNullValidator]` `findClass(java.lang.ObjectCustomizer)` `findClass(org.hibernate.validator.internal.constraintvalidators.bv.NotNullValidatorCustomizer)` Oh right, sorry. I have a demo project too, if you wanted to see The exception is caught and it ` --> Passing on ClassNotFoundException` so I can't see the stack trace. It looks like this is just the way it tries to find it But I think this https://github.com/philwebb/spring-boot/commit/1dad81acf7a45924a06c2cf3edc8b1a1bd3fe1b8 comes to the core of fixing the problem I didn't notice it before this chat, so I guess I can only add my vote to getting the issue fixed as a performance improvement. 
solution: 

issue: Spring Boot 2 migration nearly done.  Woohoo!  As far as I can tell, the last issue is that Swagger 2 no longer works.  I had @EnableWebMvc that added two resource handlers ("swagger-ui.html" and "/webjars/**") and with that it works, but WebMvcConfigurationAdapter is deprecated.  Any idea on how to get Swagger to work without WebMvcConfigurationAdapter? 
solution: 

issue: Just implement `WebMvcConfigurer` directly. Default methods in Java 8 mean that the adapter class is redundant. Also, you probably don’t want `@EnableWebMvc` in a Boot app as it’ll switch off all of the auto-configuraton of Spring MVC With Boot’s auto-configuration, a `WebMvcConfigurer` bean will be picked up without `@EnableWebMvc`. That might be all you intended to use it for, but you’re also switching off all of Boot’s MVC auto-configuration by using it 
solution: Note that `/webjars/**` is handled for you by the MVC auto-configuration so if you remove `@EnableWebMvc` you can focus on the Swagger-specific stuff (just `swagger-ui.html`, probably).. 

issue: I only added @EnableWebMVc to get swagger to work.  That's all I use it for 
solution: 

issue: ok thanks 
solution: 

issue: Will `@Scheduled` work for a protected/private method? 
solution: 

issue: No. You have to be able to call it from another bean. (Not a spring-boot question BTW) 
solution: 

issue: Please ask Reactor-specific questions here: https://gitter.im/reactor/reactor 
solution: 

issue: Hey, where can I find the possible yaml configuration properties available for a certain package? For example: security oauth2. Been looking for the and can't seem to find them. 
solution: 

issue: But I'd be fine populating via repository methods, since I have entities with relationships and such. I don't see JSON/XML really fit for that. 
solution: 

issue: I guess it's me not being able to imagine how to do this with JSON 
solution: 

issue: @s-kunze your `ImageGenerator` is not thread safe 
solution: 

issue: There is an interesting question on stackoverflow about applicability of `server.servlet.context-path` to `webflux` module. Logically, I assume `server.servlet.*` properties wouln't apply to `webflux` but I didn't find a `webflux` equivalant of `server.servlet.context-path`.https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49192878/change-spring-boot-2-0-context-path?noredirect=1#49192878 
solution: 

issue: Problem is: a library I depend on has a `ServletContextInitializer` implementation which seems unable to find classes outside the WAR (i.e. on JAR dependencies) when run with Spring Boot (whereas deploying on e.g. WildFly works as expected). @wilkinsona Thank you, I've read the docs! So `ServletContainerInitializer`s are not executed in Spring Boot, then how should I get annotated classes? In `ServletContainerInitializer` I'd use `@HandlesTypes`. 
solution: 

issue: There’s not a spring-shell gitter is there? 
solution: 

issue: I see that it throws `SqlExceptionHelper: Driver@f4a08543 returned null for URL` exception, but it doesn't stop the boot process 
solution: 

issue: "@Where" annotation? use it with caution it will not applied on joins if entity A has relationship to entity B and B is deleted findAll() on A will make those "deleted" B reachable however if you try find that B by id - you will get nothing it creates a lot of confusion, so think about it in prior I have no silver bullet for this but I would recommend avoid "@Where" only straightforward "isdeleted = false" in query builders/repositories or if use where apply it to every relationship also @OneToMany(fetch=FetchType.LAZY, mappedBy="parent")@Where(clause = "isdeleted = false")public List<Child> children; it is easy to forgot to put where to every relation 
solution: 

issue: `user.isdeleted IS FALSE` is it correct syntax for your db? another issue is that where uses plain sql, not jpql so it is not portable :) 
solution: 

issue: depends if you need to inject it somewhere as part of the contextx lifecycle or not 
solution: @snicoll I'd just like to add it as a dep and have those beans on my context.. 

issue: Hi there, I know this  is not  java core platform, but I have a scenario.... of migrating an old application from  OC4J  to glassfish.  My  problem is that I need glassfish server that will work with jdk 1.4.... Its not vailable, all glashfish containers available are using jdk 1.5 and above. 
solution: 

issue: Sounds like a proxying problem Does it work if you remove `@RefreshScope`? 
solution: 

issue: I’m not sure why it would have worked with SR6 as, AFAIK, no proxying configuration changed between SR6 and SR7. What version of Spring Cloud were you using in each case? 
solution: 

issue: gotcha…thanks the `--logging.config` works, i also checked `-DLog4jContextSelector`, it’s working coz this comaplained about LMAX Disruptor library in classpath…which is the right behavior 
solution: 

issue: Okay - forget the problem. Can anybody tell my why **this** `http://localhost:8081/users/` is the problem? (Hint: `http://localhost:8081/users`) I can't believe how long it took me to get behind this .. and yes - i get why this additional `/` is a problem .. 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona I'll create an example, the problem is not directly related to Spring Security it can be produced with every Servlet filter that throws an exception 
solution: 

issue: If you want the request URL to be logged for any filter that throws an exception, it’s the container that’ll need to do the logging Alternatively, you could declare your own `Filter` ordered with highest precedence that catches `Throwable`, logs whatever you need, and then rethrows 
solution: 

issue: @oleg-sukhov You also need a JAXB Implementation. I've added the following dependency: ```        <dependency>            <groupId>org.glassfish.jaxb</groupId>            <artifactId>jaxb-runtime</artifactId>            <version>2.3.0</version>        </dependency>``` The compiler-args can be removed and the API will be resolved as transitive dependency ah sorry, Java 9.... don't know whether the compiler args can be removed. But adding the jaxb-runtime should work @oleg-sukhov Hmm sorry, I'm not working with Java 8 yet. Just experimented with Java 9 and also had the JAXB problem. My DataSources worked fine 
solution: 

issue: For example, Boot uses `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.web.servlet.WebMvcProperties.Servlet.loadOnStartup` as the property for the dispatcher servlet registration bean’s load on startup configuration 
solution: 

issue: Ok, now i got what you mean.But there is still a inconsistency between the actual binding and the `spring-boot-configuration-processor`. If a "only-setter"-property should be bindable, the annotatin processor should detect it. If the annotation processor is correct and the property should not be bindable, the runtime should not bind it. 
solution: 

issue: @larsgrefer Great hint! Only one initializer is found: `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jersey.JerseyAutoConfiguration` And it's not the one I'd expect. There's at least one other initializer in the classpath (Vaadin). 
solution: 

issue: Tried, not working. The same app debug shows my `Application` class found in WildFly 11 but in 12 it's not. 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona Hi! Well, I think it's "significant" ([link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49181005/client-authorization-not-working-for-unit-tests)) because it actually describes another endpoint. so `localhost:8080/api/users` and `localhost:8080/api/users/` are simply two different REST endpoints. I think I adopted that from a tutorial or something - I only removed the additional `/` for pure aesthetic reasons :D that's how the error was fixed. ^^ 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona I’ll try with the deployment structure file, as I do not have that in my app. Well, the culprit seems to be whether the WAR is compiled with JDK 1.8 or 9. If compiled with 9, Spring does not start in WildFly 12; if with 1.8, it does. In WildFly 11 it starts with both. Somehow, WildFly 12 does not provide Spring the `WebApplicationInitializers` if compiled with Java 9. https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-9961

issue: I'm having an issue deploying an app to wildfly 10 with spring-boot 2... the log4j changes appear to be messing things up 
solution: 

issue: found a message from december about struts encountering the same issue with the 2.10 api... I'm going to roll back to 1.5.10 for now, I guess 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona I did some research, that issue is fixed in jandex 2.0.4 which is available in Wildfly 12. However, I'm deploying against the current JBoss EAP 7.1 which is still running Wildfly 11 or 10... Red Hat doesn't make it easy to figure out. When I add the application server to IDEA, it lists the version as 11.0.10-Final-redhat-1

solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona what do you mean? You mean, why the `DatasourceConnectionProviderImpl` is not using the pool or why is it used at all? 
solution: 

issue: @kenrachynski debug logging is enabled. Not sure if it is enabled for the root logger. However I noticed another weird behaviour, that some exceptions (e.g. from hibernate) are swallowed and you only get a generic exception like "Something went wrong". For example, I have hibernate validating the schema on startup and the validation failed, but I only got a "SessionFactory bean creation error" instead of the full stack. I enabled DEBUG logging for spring and hibernate. Maybe that is related? I will turn on debug logging and let you know if that provides some more details I will be back tomorrow, it is pretty late here (-: 
solution: 

issue: You could make `@Foo` a `@Qualifier` (might be good enough; depends on the use case) `AutowireCandidateResolver` is the low-level strategy I think you might be able to plug one in using an `ApplicationContextInitializer` 
solution: 

issue: i am trying to achieve this by using property management.endpoints.web.base-path but this is not working for me whether i need to add any jar in my pom.xml i already added <dependency>            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>        </dependency> <dependency>            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>        </dependency>

issue: @here is there a way to limit http post size on tomcat in springboot. I have attempted to add something like this to my application.properties : server.tomcat.max-http-post-size=1000 but when hitting the post endpoint with mockmvc it gets to the controller which tells me it passes thru , my payload is 5000000 bytes. This is using spring-boot 1.5.8. any feedback is appreciated. 
solution: 

issue: @jarmaker using mockmvc doesn't involve tomcat, the server is not started at all. 
solution: all right, will try to hit it via postman. Thanks @bclozel. 

issue: @wilkinsona  Thanks Andy, I'm going to leave tests out of the resource model module and just put them in the web module using mock mvc as you suggest 
solution: 

issue: And also if I want to have the support I need to write my custom deprecations in the `additional` metadata? 
solution: 

issue: @here not able to limit http post size on springboot tomcat. I have attempted to add something like this to my application.properties : server.tomcat.max-http-post-size=1000 I do see the autoconfig sets this when setting breakpoinsts but when hitting the post endpoint with Postmanand a significantly large payload gets processed all the way to my controller.This is using spring-boot 1.5.8. any feedback is appreciated. 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona  trying to limit the size so it won't go pass 1MB because my backend has a hard limit for processing data payload ideally would like to set it to  1048576 ( 1 MB), noted your reference, I was under the impression that  setting server.tomcat.max-http-post-size would revise the underlying embedded  tomcat container maxSize, but that does not seem to be the case. My request is a json payload which contains a based64 encoded attribute, if that matters. I will try giving this a shot: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33232849/increase-http-post-maxpostsize-in-spring-boot ```java// Set maxPostSize of embedded tomcat server to 10 megabytes (default is 2 MB, not large enough to support file uploads > 1.5 MB)@BeanEmbeddedServletContainerCustomizer containerCustomizer() throws Exception {    return (ConfigurableEmbeddedServletContainer container) -> {        if (container instanceof TomcatEmbeddedServletContainerFactory) {            TomcatEmbeddedServletContainerFactory tomcat = (TomcatEmbeddedServletContainerFactory) container;            tomcat.addConnectorCustomizers(                (connector) -> {                    connector.setMaxPostSize(10000000); // 10 MB                }            );        }    };}``` no dice, requests still go thru without capping or erroring out at configured maxPostSize.

issue: Morning guys!I am facing an issue using spring boot with actuator and ratpack, basically because I need to disable web mvc to run ratpack, but as soon as I do it, actuator does not startI understand the reason but I am looking for a workaround (I already found, making ratpack run in another port, but then I would have ratpack, actuator management and one http server useless up) 
solution: 

issue: so in this case I need provide my own WebTestClient bean 
solution: 

issue: I'm trying to follow cloud-native-java from Josh Long on youtube but with spring-boot 2. I'm stuck on how to make available the "/refresh" endpoint. In spring-boot 1.x it was by activated by default and I can see on the startup logs that the ```EndpointHandlerMapping     : Mapped "{[/refresh || /refresh.json],methods=[POST]}" onto public java.lang.Object org.springframework.cloud.endpoint.GenericPostableMvcEndpoint.invoke()```Any suggestion is appreciated. Thanks, Edmond 
solution: 

issue: I have a route configured as this:```javapublic RouterFunction<ServerResponse> dummyFilterRoutes() { // Dummy route configuration for testing ResourceParsingFilter return RouterFunctions.route(RequestPredicates.GET("/abc/{id}"), req -> ServerResponse.ok().build())   .andRoute(RequestPredicates.GET("/abc/"), req -> ServerResponse.ok().build()) // Search URL   .andRoute(RequestPredicates.PUT("/abc/{id}"), req -> ServerResponse.ok().build())   .andRoute(RequestPredicates.DELETE("/abc/{id}"), req -> ServerResponse.ok().build())   .filter(myFilterBean());}```Is there anything wrong with this configuration? Because, when I am running a test with `@WebTestClient` it fails for `PUT-with-ID` URL. And, instead of 400, it's throwing 404```java@Testpublic void put_withoutId() { webTestClient.put().uri("/abc/")  .exchange() // Fire http request  .expectStatus() // Assert on HTTP Status  .isBadRequest() // I have a validation to send error message if ID is not present  .expectHeader() // Assert Headers  ;}``` 
solution: 

issue: @nitelite not really, please ask on #spring-data @nnanda2016 hard to tell by just sharing the test method. Sharing a sample we can run can save a lot of time for everyone 
solution: 

issue: `@WebFluxTest` doesn’t work with router functions. You have to import it explicitely as we can’t figure out that stuff 
solution: 

issue: does that help too? yea… even i was thinking same… 
solution: 

issue: I am not sure, but looks like WebFlux is not mapping the routes properly for `PUT`, `DELETE`…  `PUT /abc/{id}`and `DELETE /abc/{id}`

solution: 

issue: Bad jar? Bad dependency management? You appear to have the wrong micrometer jar on your classpath. Why are you using snapshots? 
solution: 

issue: What branch are you using that’s creating 2.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT and using Micrometer rc 5? master is 2.0.1.BUILD-SNAPSHOT and using Micrometer 1.0.2 
solution: 

issue: Thanks. I was just afraid about using the executor directly instead of using @Async for example in the spring app context 
solution: @wilkinsona Yeah … I thought of `accept`. What's the current way to kick of some computation and return the response immediately? There are several solutions and I wonder what's the current way to go..

solution: 

issue: @mujeeb1238 Your pom? Possibility is, you have spring boot 1.*.* and now downloading 2 is causing problem. Backup your maven `.m2` folder, empty `.m2` and execute `mvn clean install` again. 
solution: 

issue: I can't see any snapshots there either (in github) I can't see any snapshots in the guide text either So I'm a bit confused about where you got your pom.xml 
solution: 

issue: @mujeeb1238 If it’s the same `pom` as specified in https://spring.io/guides/gs/centralized-configuration/#initial it should work without any problems.

issue: Hi All. I have a problem with spring boot 2.0 gradle and java 9. I've generated a simple project using spring initializer (from IDE). And it worked fine. After that I was trying to add module descriptor, like this ```module demo.main {  requires spring.boot;  requires spring.boot.autoconfigure;}```I haven't touched gradle.build file .

Some of them has an annotation @DirtiesContext(classMode = ClassMode.BEFORE_CLASS) to make sure that context will be refreshed. However TransactionInterceptor remains same and contains TransactionManager which points to closed DataSource ... May I somehow instruct Spring to recreate all needed contexts? 
solution: 

issue: How? Does it mean that Spring Boot is not fully ready to Jigsaw? 
solution: That issue there has nothing to do with Spring Boot.

solution: 

issue: Access logging is really best done at the container level So you could either stick with Tomcat’s and live with it being in a separate file, or you could write something Tomcat-specific that logs to the same file as your application 
solution: 

issue: I don't 
solution: maybe the better question would be, what's the right place to file a bug asking for a guide that does that. 

issue: guess I'm just questioning whether it's really a data rest issue if it's just asking what's needed to mimick those apis without data rest 
solution: 

issue: And if you want this to be initalized, you have to tell the container (adding it as an injection point is the right way to do it) 
solution: 

issue: Can I somehow tell `@ConfigurationProperties` that some of the properties are required? To generate startup error messages on misconfiguration 
solution: 

issue: Yes, there's a known issue about that (https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-14411). Please comment/vote there if you wish. In the meantime, using a `ResponseEntity` with a forced content-type should work 
solution: 

issue: ah, excellent, was already banging my head around it ;-) Forcing a content-type for errors should work for me, thanks!

solution: 

issue: What would be the name of the environment variable I'd have to set to access `@ConfigurationProperties("foo.bar.some-thing") … String stuffInCamelCase`? I tired `FOO_BAR_SOMETHING_STUFFINCAMELCASE` and I tired `FOO_BAR_SOME_THING_STUFF_IN_CAMEL_CASE` … both are not recognized … @snicoll Yeah … but if I use `some-thing` the environment variable resolution doesn't work any more :-( 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona Nope, doesn't work either :-( 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona Seems like you have to specify the `prefix` in camel case as well … Hm, I'm still stuck on 1.5.10 Here. But as i Said: it doesnt Work :-( 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona Yeah … but can you come up with a working example? `@ConfigurationProperties("foo.bar.someThing")` works with `PATH_TO_SOMETHING_AND_A_VARIABLE_IN_CAMEL_CASE` It's annoying that the variable is separated using _ and the prefix is not … 
solution: 

issue: @hanishi dunno, sorry. It looks like a nasty remote execution vulnerability though (you are executing code from a remote service). Maybe try running with `-Dspring.expression.compiler.mode=OFF` (in case it's something to do with the compiler)? 
solution: 

issue: @dsyer you want me to discuss this further in another room? I think the spring-security-oauth or spring-cloud-security room is more suitable for this problem (it's indeed not directly related to spring-boot) 
solution: Either would be fine. It's a spring-cloud-security feature you are using I think.. 

issue: @hanishi nevermind, I was confused. The expression is in your app, not in the remote one. I doubt it. Did you check the HTTP status? Maybe it's not a 200 when it fails? 
solution: 

issue: @dsyer Would  HTTP's connection keep-alive affect the ResponseEntity? 
solution: 

issue: Spring Framework relaxed that behavior a bit in https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-16542 (to be released in 5.0.5) but your server not accepting chunked encoding is the root issue 
solution: 

issue: there is `@ControllerEndpoint` and `@RestControllerEndpoint` for anything that goes beyond the use of the endpoint API @filiphr that’s not really an extension since it wouldn’t work with Jersey (or WebFlux depending on what the implementation is doing)

issue: Hi @snicoll , any idea how to circumvent this blocking issue related to querydsl incompatibility with Hibernate 5.2? See here: https://github.com/querydsl/querydsl/issues/1917 
solution: 

issue: That looks like a copy and paste from Stack Overflow. Can you just share the link? 
solution: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49542368/package-dosent-exists-when-including-a-jar-from-local-maven-repository-to-anothe. It’s a duplicate of an existing question. 

issue: @bclozel I read the code of  `org.springframework.http.client.reactive.ReactorClientHttpResponse` and found that it only use `reactor.ipc.netty.NettyInbound#receive`. It seems to me that it just don’t using the method `reactor.ipc.netty.http.client.HttpClientResponse#receiveContent`at all. 
solution: I see that you are not packaging your additional metadata in your jar. I tried to find in your pom(s) where you do it, but I couldn't find anything. Did I miss something? How are you doing it?. 

issue: Hi, while updating a Spring 1.5.x app to 2.0.0 I see this error during unittesting ```Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: PropertySource named 'applicationConfig: [classpath:/bootstrap.yml] (document #1)' cannot be added relative to itself at org.springframework.core.env.MutablePropertySources.assertLegalRelativeAddition(MutablePropertySources.java:198) at org.springframework.core.env.MutablePropertySources.addAfter(MutablePropertySources.java:139) at org.springframework.boot.context.config.ConfigFileApplicationListener$Loader.addLoadedPropertySources(ConfigFileApplicationListener.java:705)``` The test has two ActiveProfiles and it looks like that's why the file is added multiple times. If I remove the second profile and only use a single one, it works correctly. Has anyone seen this? Shall I file an issue for it? 
solution: 

issue: So is there a way to get at what I'm trying to do? 
solution: Hmm, I guess you could make some assumptions based on your endpoint's URL. Your endpoint will be called with something like `http://example.com/actuator/your-endpoint-id`. If you chop `/your-endpoint-id` off the URL and then pass that to the links resolver I think you’ll get the right answer. 

issue: I don’t think you actually need the value of the `BEST_MATCHING_PATTERN_ATTRIBUTE` The request URL from the `HttpServletRequest` is the right thing to use in the Servlet case. That’s what’s used in the mapping that produces all the endpoint links On the WebFlux side, you want the `ServerWebExchange` so that you can get the request and retrieve its URI. I’m not sure how to do that as `RequestContextHolder` is thread-bound and Servlet-specific.

Is using `java -jar` preferred over using the script generated by `installDist`?

issue: @alaaeddinezammel Not easily, no. Spring Boot doesn’t not have any OSGi bundle metadata in its jar files. 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona  why it is easy with spring mvc & spring dm what special in spring boot making it not easy to integrate with osgi 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona  lol what response :p @wilkinsona i still no understanding why it works fine for spring mvc&dm i understand that u are not supporting it any more but why spirng mvc and not boot the technical part 
solution: 

issue: okey now i can t go back i should do it a spring boot inside osgi container can u help me trying to do it with steps or links & thank you for the response i get it now   @wilkinsona 
solution: No, not really. I wouldn’t advise anyone to use OSGi and Spring. I don’t think that OSGi brings enough value to Spring applications to justify the added complexity. At this point, if you must use OSGI, then I don’t think you should try to use Spring (or any of the JVM ecosystem that’s typically used with Spring).. 

issue: actually im stacked inside  a big trade project composing of many osgi projects and there is a lot of application (osgi based ) big projects used spring why you are killin osgi :p anyway im asked to add module inside this big projects and i found out that they are using old spring inside there osgi big project 
solution: 

issue: Interesting. I used Boot’s Tomcat sample when I wrote the code and it worked there. I wonder what the difference is @cforce Please ask in https://gitter.im/spring-cloud/spring-cloud 
solution: 

issue: there is no properties-based support for that (as explained in the doc) 
solution: That’s a feature of spring-data-redis so their documentation should cover that. 

issue: Hi there, i wonder what is the easy way to check in an aspect was executed or not - given: i have a method with two annotations: `@Cacheable`and a custom one `@TraceDatabaseCall`. The second onethat measures the execution time. But i only want to measure the time if the database call was not cached. 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll 
solution: @edeandrea No. A request is not tied to a particular thread, so we can't extract request information from ThreadLocal. 

issue: @arony What’s the connection between that code and “service name”. I can’t see one. 
solution: @wilkinsona any service name at down stream. I am trying to add OAuth2RestTample for all microservices. For example: Could not fetch user details: class org.springframework.web.client.ResourceAccessException, I/O error on GET request for "http://auth-service/uaa/user": auth-service; nested exception is java.net.UnknownHostException: auth-service. 

issue: Isn’t that a DNS problem? Is `auth-service` a host that you expect to be known on your network? 
solution: @wilkinsona  Isn't it supposed to resolve service name through eureka discovery? Because it works when I add that class to project.  The problem happens when tried to add as a starter dependency for all sub module. 

issue: I don’t know. That’s a question for https://gitter.im/spring-cloud/spring-cloud. 
solution: 

issue: I am sorry if what I just did was rude 
solution: It’s not rude, it’s just not a very efficient way to get some help. While this isn’t Stack Overflow [the advice](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) about asking good questions and sharing code that reproduces a problem still broadly applies.. Well I just wanted know if it was the default behavior I didn't acknowledge it is a problem. 

issue: I am using whatever the `RestTemplateBuilder ` is passed to the constructor that is retrieved from application's context. 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona My config is quite simple:```management.endpoint.health.show-details = alwaysmanagement.endpoints.web.exposure.include = health, info, metrics, env``` 
solution: 

issue: What version of Boot and Micrometer are you using? There was a leak in Micrometer in the RC phase: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/11338 
solution: 

issue: Spring Boot 2.0.0.RELEASE and micrometer-core 1.0.1 
solution: Should be fine then. You could either us a debugger or the actuator’s metrics endpoint to get some information about all the meters. 

issue: 250KB sounds like quite a lot of tags 
solution: 

issue: No, it does not. 
solution: 

issue: Hi Team,Facing issue with actuator endpoints after upgrading to spring boot 2. As even after setting `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*` , I am getting 404 for all actuator endpoints. It must be issue with my local but I just created new spring boot application with required dependency for actuator and spring security. 
solution: 

issue: I am using `localhost:8080/actuator/beans` 
solution: 

issue: okk. thank you :) 
solution: @wilkinsona Good Lordy is Spring Security deep. After two days I've boiled what I needed down to three tiny classes from a mountain of possible solutions. It works and I gain HTTP Basic support without having to do any effort. :-). 

issue: @Weakue can't you use the `@Value` annotation? 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona , @bclozel Regarding the URI tag leak, changing the `WebFluxTagsProvider` implementation to replace all the UUIDs in my URIs to a constant string limited the tags to just a few and the OOME did not occur anymore. Thanks for your help on this! 
solution: 

issue: @jkathiresan I don't know. Just not this one. 
solution: 

issue: Yeah, maybe. @snicoll How would I use the cache in my code? 
solution: I already told you. (though I can’t be definitive since I am not sure I understand what you’re doing). 

issue: what is not the case? 
solution: There's no `CacheManager` bean auto configured here …. 

issue: But shouldn't ```        <dependency>            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-cache</artifactId>        </dependency>``` be enough? 
solution: Speficically>The @EnableCaching annotation triggers a post processor that inspects every Spring bean for the presence of caching annotations on public methods. If such an >annotation is found, a proxy is automatically created to intercept the method call and handle the caching behavior accordingly.>>The annotations that are managed by this post processor are Cacheable, CachePut and CacheEvict. You can refer to the javadocs and the documentation for more >details.>>Spring Boot automatically configures a suitable CacheManager to serve as a provider for the relevant cache. See the Spring Boot documentation for more details.>>Our sample does not use a specific caching library so our cache store is the simple fallback that uses ConcurrentHashMap. The caching abstraction supports a wide >range of cache library and is fully compliant with JSR-107 (JCache).?. 

issue: Sorry but I can’t continue this discussion at the moment. I don’t understand what you’re doing. If you follow the guide then you must have a cachemanager bean (if you don’t, you’re not using caching at all) 
solution: I still don’t know why it doesn’t work for you and the guide is all that you need to get a CacheManager bean in your project so compare the guide with your own setup. If that doesn’t work, share a sample that I can run myself, it will be more effective. 

issue: Why's that? I need a cache as fallback … I'm trying to get a cache … how's that not what I wrote initially? 
solution: 

issue: @amirensit  What’s the connection with Spring Boot? 
solution: And if you take the time to Google, it looks like `FilterBuilders` doesn’t exist any more.. 

issue: and I'm getting ```kotlin.UninitializedPropertyAccessException: lateinit property entityManager has not been initialized``` I'm trying to access the EntityManager from a ```@Component``` 
solution: 

issue: Hi there. Are there any known issues with Spring Boot 2.0.1 and Java 10? Is Java 10 officially supported? 
solution: 

issue: I’m not sure if we’re ready to state that Java 10 is officially supported, but both Spring Boot and Spring Framework build fine with Java 10 
solution: 

issue: Thank you. Spring Initializr does not offer Java 10 yet, so I will stick to Java 9 for now. 
solution: 

issue: Thanks @bclozel I see the fix was done to replace my-project (kebab-case) to myProject (camel case) for the prefix? Is that the expectation. I assume with 2.0 we can't have camel case in prefix. *All prefixes must be in kebab-case format (lower-case, hyphen separated), acme.myProject or acme.my_project are invalid - you must use acme.my-project here.* (Reference the migration guide https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.0-Migration-Guide#relaxed-binding ) @bclozel filed https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/12782 
solution: 

issue: I haven’t heard of anyone else having that problem. 1.5.11 uses the same version of Hibernate as 1.5.10 did (5.0.12). You mention H2 and 1.5.11 upgraded from H2 1.4.196 to 1.4.197. Perhaps something changed there that’s causing the problem? Nice… Which table’s missing when you run with 1.4.197? @kschlesselmann Set a `<hibernate.version>` property in your pom @konstantinblaesi Please ask Spring Cloud questions in the [Spring Cloud room](https://gitter.im/spring-cloud/spring-cloud) 
solution: 

issue: weird … it's the only thing I change here … and it's just using H2 Let me check @wilkinsona Using the old version the tests run again :-S @wilkinsona What's the proper way to change this version? 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona Sorry … can't test that right now since the app doesn't run with Hibernate 5.2 right now … :-( 
solution: 

issue: then I'am doing GET Request to http://localhost:4567/message and getting error like this one {    "timestamp": 1523013720524,    "status": 403,    "error": "Forbidden",    "message": "Access to the requested resource has been denied",    "path": "/message"} 
solution: 

issue: @styx_hcr_twitter  BTW Thank you so much for your helping. 
solution: Hmm, seems you can't use array types as hardcoded claims. Too bad.. 

issue: Ah, nice. We can't use the KC adapter, that's why I don't know all the details there. Seems this switches between using realm and client roles. So this explains why it works, you have realm roles defined.

issue: Hi…how can I supply my own launch script using `embeddedLaunchScript`? I mean where in the gradle can I configure this? i have configured the `bootJar` task, but not sure how can I supply my own script. 
solution: 

issue: Hi Team, Something to confirm regarding spring boot 2 changes for Configuration property name. is `${test.customPlatform.services.url}/user` wrong to have as value for property. As I am getting error for this:```Configuration property name 'test.customPlatform.services' is not valid:    Invalid characters: 'P'    Bean: userServiceClient    Reason: Canonical names should be kebab-case ('-' separated), lowercase alpha-numeric characters and must start with a letter``` 
solution: 

issue: well, may be you are right; we have faced exact same issue when defining `@ConfigurationProperties` to load a prefix based config hehee….but that’s what most yaml loving guys prefer…:) 
solution: 

issue: hi, I cant't find `spring-projects/spring-security-oauth` room,  I use  `oauth2` in my project. I want to use `spring-projects/spring-security-oauth`. Do I have to learn to use `spring-security` first? 
solution: 

issue: Any reason/idea why `JndiLocatorDelegate` is not created through `JndiLocatorDelegate::createDefaultResourceRefLocator` in `JndiConnectionFactoryAutoConfiguration`? 
solution: 

issue: I can’t recall why it’s like that. Why is it a problem? 
solution: JMS resources (connection factory, queues, topics) can't be found.. I have to prepend them with `java:comp/env/` in a configuraton. 

issue: So it’s not really a problem, more a question of brevity in your configuration? 
solution: 

issue: If the code in .map is being executed, the status code returned should not be 200 But the returned status code is always 200 Yup, sorry https://gist.github.com/kevin-madhu/166890b732ad8763dff136ba19770e13 The whole code for Controller and Service is in there 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona https://gitlab.com/kevin.madhu/akoutin.git It's got to do something with the reactive side of the app. map, flatMap and roleRepo.delete I guess. But I tried changing them to everything I can. @wilkinsona Anyways, this is a good point you've mentioned. I did not notice that I'm still using spring-mvc instead of webflux. I'm new to spring. 
solution: 

issue: Anybody has any idea about my problem? 
solution: 

issue: Dear guys, I have used v1.5.9, but now I want to integrate with Spring Security 5, so I have to upgrade to Spring Boot v2.0.0 Is there anyone tried this, could you give me some feedback or your exp about this? I also find some other newer versions, so should I use v2.0.0 or newers? And I got a bugs with Thymleaf, that the html is not generated as I expected, but It worked fine with older version. Any comment? 
solution: 

issue: @shakuzen already followed your  link  but get numerous problem https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49739072/405-error-on-webservices-calls-after-migrating-spring-boot-1-5-to-2-0 @vcoder4c good question will check 
solution: 

issue: @istiti I got some issues which related to Thymeleaf because Spring Boot 2.0 have been using Thymeleaf 3.0. Do you have any issues with this? 
solution: 

issue: @gbtec-ext-sergeyuzhakov Please ask Spring Cloud questions in https://gitter.im/spring-cloud/spring-cloud 
solution: 

issue: No, it isn’t needed (and will switch off Boot’s WebFlux auto-configruation) https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-webflux-auto-configuration You don’t need to move to the functional style, BTW. You can use `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping` etc with WebFlux if you wish 
solution: 

issue: Okay I can ask relating spring boot and reactor in any one of them? @bclozel  Because I'm not sure if this one is related to the boot or reactor. That's why I cross posted. 
solution: 

issue: if you've got reactor-specific questions (reactor-core operators, reactor-netty) then #reactor. Spring Framework has no gitter, so the #spring-boot channel will do its best to help you (but we can't field all questions about all technologies that Spring Boot supports) 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys, I'm trying to implement a generic repository for soft delete so in my RepositoryImpl I have done this (Kotlin):```class SoftDeleteRepositoryImpl<T, ID : Serializable>(domainClass: Class<T>, em: EntityManager) : SoftDeleteRepository<T, ID>, SimpleJpaRepository<T, ID>(domainClass, em) {```But I'm getting a message saying that it cannot autowire domainClass 
solution: 

issue: here's the error ```Could not autowire. No beans of 'Class<T>' type found. Checks autowiring problems in a bean class.``` 
solution: 

issue: in WebFlux the request body can be converted to Mono using request.bodyToMono(Resource::class.java) But the ReactiveMongoRepository<Resource, String> requires Resource instead of Mono<Resource> Any work arounds? But in handler, we get ServerRequest 
solution: 

issue: Got it, thanks :) 
solution: 

issue: I'm not so sure that I can answer your question correctly, but I think that on your first example, you have two beans with the same class type (both are Foo), for the second example, it can work because you have two class type (Foo and Foo2). @SirWayne . Need to wait for the confirmation from expert. 
solution: 

issue: > It is already the casedid you mean, spring boot already have this implemented? I also want to know that can we add metrics for any particular actuator endpoint and off for others? > and I don't understand what you mean by `add metrics for any particular actuator endpoint and off for others`Actually I only want to produce metrics for `RefreshEndpoint` but not for others. 
solution: 

issue: @JagmohanSharma actuator endpoints are already producing metrics data, just like any other web endpoint in your app and I don't understand what you mean by `add metrics for any particular actuator endpoint and off for others` you want to enable disable metrics on a per endpoint basis? or add different tags depending on the the endpoint? `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler` doesn't exist in webflux. But `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler` do work.In Spring Boot, you get even more support with the error handling (see the reference documentation for Spring Boot) 
solution: 

issue: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.0.1.RELEASE/reference/html/ https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.0.1.RELEASE/reference/html/boot-features-developing-web-applications.html#boot-features-webflux-error-handling This section?

issue: Hi!!! Good morning from Spain mates! I need to configure my Datasource at runtime using Spring 2.0.1. Do you know the correct way to do this?! Thanks!!! 
solution: 

issue: @mp911de thanks Mark! but my problem is that when i start the application i dont know the user and password. My application needs to consult this data (using an external system), and, after, initialize the datasource. Sorry if the question is absurd, I'm still a newbie in SpringBoot :D @vcoder4c no! I only need one datasource, but my problem is that i haven't the credentials when the app is initializing 
solution: 

issue: It’s not in the doc, we don’t have that Please watch https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/12851 
solution: 

issue: @kevin-madhu you're probably referring to that: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46508618/spring-5-webflux-functional-endpoints-how-to-perform-input-validationI can't give a better answer than Arjen's (he's leading that part in Spring Framework).

issue: So they are discovered when you make them Beans, but why are they not beans automatically? 
solution: 

issue: I upgraded to the most recent version of spring boot and all of my controller tests now throw this error: `java.lang.ClassCastException: org.springframework.security.web.servletapi.HttpServlet3RequestFactory$SecurityContextAsyncContext cannot be cast to org.springframework.mock.web.MockAsyncContext` - i found an issue in JIRA for it.  but JIRA is down at the moment.  Does anyone know a work-around for this yet? 
solution: 

issue: @shubham-negi it's probably the most common container for Jvms in Linux containers (former conceptual, latter explicit). 
solution: 

issue: What's JVM container? Haven't encountered this before ;) 
solution: 

issue: @shubham-negi I used "container" in two different ways, and I'm sorry if that was confusing. ignore the "container for jvms" term. it's simply the most common way to run java in a docket container. 
solution: On the servlet side using MockMvc I can do assertions like ‘.jsonPath(“$.someNestedObject.*”, Matchers.hasSize(5))’ or ‘.jsonPath(“$.someNestedObject”).value(Matchers.startsWith(“some string”))’How do I accomplish similar things when using ‘WebTestClient’? I don’t see similar methods when calling ‘.exchange().expectBody().jsonPath. Seems ‘JsonPathAssertions’ uses the same underlying ‘JsonPathExpectationsHelper’ as the servlet-based ‘JsonPathResultMatchers’ but some of the overloaded ‘value’ methods aren’t exposed. Is there a reason for this? Is there another way to accomplish the same thing?. 

issue: Each thread of execution would need to have it’s own GUID through the callstack.  I’m not sure I fully understand the scope at with Spring AOP works 
solution: 

issue: Is there any way I can set cross-origin from application properties ? I dont want to put @CrossOrigin on all api-controllers :( found the solution thanks 
solution: 

issue: reactive programming paradigm uses non-blocking async model…so, threads keep on reused for different tasks... good thing is, in project reactor, the team addressed this issue and came up with a solution (http://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#context) which works…but it certainly requires code change and spring-cloud-sleuth’s 2.x version uses a hybrid approach (reactor context + ThreadLocal) to propagate the trace ids …i am rt now evaluating this for my app

issue: Hi Team,Getting error of `HTTP ERROR 406` Not acceptable content, when using spring boot 2.0.1 for each actuator endpoint but it was working fine with spring boot 2.0.0 without any other change. Did anyone else face same issue or might be I am missing something here? 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll  I will share a sample code with details. 
solution: @orkhanmirzayev I mean, yeah, you should. Won't take long :). 

issue: Hi I am migrating to spring boot 2.0.0.RELEASE but there are some properties deprecated management.security.enabled management.security.roles it is asking me to provide WebMvcSecurity|ConfigurerAdpater > @orkhanmirzayev please review the migration guide first https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.0-Migration-Guide Thanks a lot, let me go through the documentation :) 
solution: 

issue: Spring Boot uses Spring Framework 
solution: then your request is running on the server… in a different thread. 

issue: basically i want to integration test a "createIfNotExists" method in my controller that will create a user in the database if you request it and it doesn't exist the controller and the test methods are annotated with @Transactional I see thanks for that advice. What would you recommend so that they share the same transaction? Ok. Is there a way that these two threads can see the same data? ok thanks anyway, ill try something else ok, i removed the transactional annotation from my test could you please elaborate on the cleaning of the db? do you mean after tests? ok thanks, i will clear it after the test i guess my CrudRepositories need to not be transactional too? ok one sec ok thank you i will show you what im doing actually think im fine for now, thanks for the help, might come back again later  
solution: 

issue: Nope, no idea what you meant by “multiple web sites" The web part is not my expertise area at all anyway. I won’t be of great help, sorry 
solution: 

issue: not that particular one... my dep problems were with jackson.version apparently referring to the jackson bom version 
solution: 

issue: @xenoterracide So far this is this the only conflict that pops up for me, (I have `failOnVersionConflict()` in my resolution strategy) 
solution: 

issue: Right, I see. I'm actually not sure if this is supposed to be supported (been wondering that myself). Perhaps you could split up the async method into a normal method and the part that actually needs to be async. 
solution: 

issue: Hi everyone, we noticed that the `spring-boot-starter-actuator` source-JAR for 2.0.1 is broken. It actually just contains just NUL values. Not that this is much of a problem, but we noticed during a build scan and found out that it's supplied like that from maven central. Is this a known issue? 
solution: 

issue: @BenEfrati thanks for this information…i was not aware of this is there any doc mentioning the difference between `-Dspring.config.location` vs this `additional-location`? for my boot-2 app, the old `location` works too 
solution: 

issue: @BenEfrati  im using 1.5.10 and can i change file name to message.properties 
solution: 

issue: Hi, in principle, is it possible to to gradually migrate a conventional Spring MVC application (using Spring Boot 2 with `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency) to a webflux based app? I can't find any direct samples on this. 
solution: 

issue: @JagmohanSharma can you please stop? You’ve opened an issue 5h ago, the team will review it as soon as we can. 
solution: 

issue: @pgodzin seems really weird to me. Your transactional context is not going to be transmitted on the new thread, not sure what you expect there. 
solution: 

issue: There’s no auto-configuration for multiple datasources (that includes database initialization). You write that code yourself (including the `DataSource`) so you can’t expect the stuff in `DataSourceProperties` to magically work in your custom code (if that’s what you’re using)

issue: @all how to set external folder location in spring boot 2? The `-Dloader.path=lib,/path/to/external/location` is not working My `bootJar` setup looks like this:```def scriptsDirectory = "./scripts"bootJar { launchScript {  script = file("${scriptsDirectory}/launch.script") }  classifier = artifactClassifier manifest {  attributes 'Manifest-Version': '1.0',   'Start-Class': 'com.demo.fn.FunctionalApplication'    }}``` 
solution: 

issue: @orkhanmirzayev i dont want to put it in classpath i want to externalize my configuration 
solution: 

issue: probably not related, but you don't need to put ```@Autowired``` on the constructor 
solution: 

issue: And where you use SystemTransactionHandler? Can you show how/where are you injecting it? @thackel yes @Autowired annotation is not needed anymore since spring (don't remember which version) if you have single constructor ;] 
solution: 

issue: @pckeyan I already answered to that didn’t I? This auto-configuration you’re using is not compatible with Spring Boot 2. Did you implemented it? If you didn’t, you need to reach out to that project to see if they can offer a Spring Boot 2 compatible version 
solution: 

issue: I can't say who’s loading that class with the info you’ve provided either 
solution: alright, let me share my beans:```    @Bean    public RestTemplate restTemplate(HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory httpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory){        return new RestTemplateBuilder()                .requestFactory(httpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory)                .build();    }    @Bean    public HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory httpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory() {        HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory httpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory = new HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory();        httpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory.setReadTimeout(1000);        httpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory.setConnectTimeout(1000);        return httpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory;    }    @Bean    public OAuth2RestTemplate oAuth2RestTemplate(HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory httpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory) {        OAuth2RestTemplate oAuth2RestTemplate = new OAuth2RestTemplate(resource());        oAuth2RestTemplate.setRequestFactory(httpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory);        return oAuth2RestTemplate;    }```. 

issue: @gandrade I wasn’t replying to you 
solution: 

issue: Evening chaps, unsure if this is a quick question or not, simply put i have integration tests and performance tests which run locally, the spring app is started using the spring boot maven plugin, however after say, the integration tests run, and tear the app down, the performance tests can't bring up another instance, it just complains and fails. I forgot to say im using maven 
solution: 

issue: 1)mvn clean 2)mvn install --spring.profile.active=dev in project folder is this command right to set active profile while building war ok @marcosbarbero thanks i wanted to deploy and that too war 
solution: If you are running it with java -jar, just add the profile activation as argument. 

issue: @SubhamAshish it doesn’t work like that. The profile activation is done when you are actually starting the application not in the build phase 
solution: 

issue: That’s the whole idea behind what you are trying to do 
solution: building up an app by environment means they are different apps, you might experience weird behaviours what are working in other environment...just changing the property in your application.(properties, yml) at deployment time may well work out your problem. 

issue: if you like having different properties based on different profiles you might have application-<profile>.(properties,yml), but I think what you want to do is just change properties based on the environment, you can do that through environment variables, having arguments in the command line call, saying which is the properties file, sit next to the jar an application.properties...( that what I can get from the top of my mind, but it might have more options...)might work for you. I hope it helps

solution: 

issue: i thank from application config cors,so I don't have to change it from the code.Although you can now use custom implementations.But I hope it benefits from native support.

solution: 

issue: Hi @smiklos, what exactly Kafka appender you're using for logback ? In case if it is https://github.com/danielwegener/logback-kafka-appender, then `deliveryStrategy` property which you use to deliver logs to Kafka producer. You can try with two available strategies:```<deliveryStrategy class="com.github.danielwegener.logback.kafka.delivery.AsynchronousDeliveryStrategy" />or <deliveryStrategy class="com.github.danielwegener.logback.kafka.delivery.BlockingDeliveryStrategy" />``` >  I will check later but as I mentioned the fileappender is also there and is not an async appender and yet nothing I can see in the logs@smiklos , try to debug `AsynchronousDeliveryStrategy` or file appender in order to understand if something has been called or not. Also it would be good if you would share `logback.xml` configuration for more clarification

Is there a reason for not supporting that? Thanks for the fast reply Should I open an issue?

issue: Have you guys had this situation before? using IDE to run the boot+ thymeleaf +layout-dialect works just fine, but after maven package it and run from java -jar app.jar , it throws a bunch of template parsing errors? I had that happens only on the boot 2, boot 1 just works fine. no luck, with 2.2.2 while it works with my other boot 1 project. 
solution: 

issue: Did you add a dependency on the layout dialect when you upgraded to Boot 2.0? It’s not part of the starter in 2.0. 
solution: It’s possible that there’s a bug in the latest version of the layout dialect that only affects fat jars. 

issue: @myhau then that would mean Spring MVC - so that's a no. The contract itself does not prevent you from using it somewhere else, but there's no infrastructure support for Spring MVC with that; 
solution: 

issue: No, nothing like that in the current plans. I don't know how that would work since there are significant differences between Servlet and reactive (especially around the use of ThreadLocal)

solution: 

issue: @eredwan that error just states that the app could not start. You should have a much more relevant information above 
solution: 

issue: that’s auto-configured, you don’t even need to have that As for your issue, it’s hard to say without more details. I am not sure what you’re trying to do, but you should look at what micrometer does for you If you add micrometer-registry-graphite to your project, you can export metrics to graphie automatically Sounds weird to me, asking on the micrometer slack will probably be more effective I see 
solution: I just wanted to know if the dropwizard auto-config is still available, because it's not working.

issue: Hi someone here is using intellij idea? when i inject a bean i have this error could not autowire. No beans of type found.Checks autowiring problems in a class bean. 
solution: 

issue: if your app running u can ignore the error 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona  Thanks Andy it worked. thanks for your suggestion :-) 
solution: 

issue: is there some cool wrapper (or utility) to get headers and cookies (in multimap) from `HttpServletRequest`  ? 
solution: 

issue: can you please format the stacktrace properly? 3 backtits there’s no error there 
solution: if there is no exception, it simply stops because there’s nothing else to do. 

issue: Is https://build.springsource.org going to be down much longer? I want to file a bug. 
solution: @jmkgreen I wasn’t aware that build.springsource.org was supposed to be up any more. What bug do you want to file?. For bug reports, I’d expect you to need https://jira.spring.io or GitHub.. 

issue: I work on a project that has very aggressive code coverage rules, so we have to have a unit test for the Application class. I'd prefer to use Mockito for this instead of PowerMock.  Is it possible to have the Application class get an instance of SpringApplicationBuilder injected?  Is there another alternative to make the test mode not start up springboot? 
solution: 

issue: Why do i keep getting this error when hovering over functions in STS4?>No live hover information available.>Live hover providers use various spring-boot-actuator endpoints to retrieve information. Consider adding spring-boot-actuator as a dependency to your project cayenne 
solution: 

issue: @marcosbarbero Yeah … I'd have to automate the refresh step using some kind of service registry of course … @marcosbarbero Or I'd have to see if there is some kind of "message bus as a service" in AWS … but AFAIK the documentation only mentions kafka and rabbit … 
solution: 

issue: My mistake, I’m sorry! I thought you said AWS options were either Kafka or rabbit 
solution: 

issue: Nope … AWS Options are none of the above if I'm not mistaken ;-) 
solution: 

issue: ```Connection is read-only. Queries leading to data modification are not allowed``` Thanks for the response am not getting why my session object is becoming readonly Thanks for the support Just an interest on knowing why second issue happening. will expore explore 
solution: 

issue: @domi55 Please ask Spring Cloud questions in https://gitter.im/spring-cloud/spring-cloud 
solution: :) no problem!. 

issue: Okay, thanks for the answer and hints I'll stay with my custom solution then. 
solution: 

issue: I need a basic info. My angular app served as a webinar from a multinodular maven project structure . In prod the app is packed as war. My app on refresh throws Whitelabel error page. It uses html style url and not hash based url. I went on stackoberflow and found Resources mapping for /static to index.html My question is will that suffice to a webinar ? I guess that is served from /META-INF and not /static Correction: webinar = webjar * 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I have a issue in connecting to H2 database for Junit test case. Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: dataSource or dataSourceClassName or jdbcUrl is required. at com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariConfig.validate(HikariConfig.java:1063) ~[HikariCP-2.7.8.jar:na] application.properties as follow spring.h2.console.enabled=truespring.jpa.properties.hibernate.generate_statistics=truelogging.level.org.hibernate.stat=debugspring.jpa.show-sql=truespring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=truelogging.level.org.hibernate.type=trace can someone please help me to solve this issue ? 
solution: 

issue: @ramkifx as per the exception you are missing the connectionUrlhere is a sample yaml connfiguration``` yamlspring:    datasource:        driver-class-name: org.h2.Driver        username: sa        password:         url: jdbc:h2:mem:db_name#        type: com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource    jpa:        properties:            hibernate:                dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect```uncomment spring.datasource.type line if you are not using springboot 2.0.0+ as it uses hikari by default,and don't forget the dialect if you are using hibernate 
solution: 

issue: I'm just providing a sample config, and regarding the dialect auto-detection I remember that I couldn't manage to get it working without specifying it explicitly, I'll double-check, thank you 
solution: 

issue: The sample config is irrelevant if they’re not using the auto-configuration is what I am trying to express 
solution: 

issue: Ok, I got your point 
solution: 

issue: the issue only happens if a field is in all caps though 
solution: 

issue: Ok, so it’s probably a Jackson issue (assuming that you’re sending JSON and using Jackson) 
solution: 

issue: i have a pretty huge/complicated spring boot 1.5.x app.  at one point i was serving an index.html file out of /src/main/resources.  At some point, something changed and i can't reach any static content from that directory any more.  i'm not sure where to start looking/troubleshooting to resolve this issue.  i was wondering if somebody could provide me with some hints as to where to start looking... 
solution: 

issue: No `WebClient` doesn’t have support for a mock server yet in framework so we can’t offer that feature I am afraid I don’t and I’d expect this to be described in the framework ref doc if that’s not the case, I’d open an issue in the issue tracker at https://jira.spring.io/projects/SPR 
solution: 

issue: @joshfix You’re a bit stuck then. I’d open an issue against the open source library and ask them to subclass `WebMvcConfigurerAdapter` if possible. Even without Boot in the picture, subclassing `WebMvcConfigurationSupport` in a library is going to cause problems No. MVC auto-configuration is switched off by either using `@EnableWebMvc` or sub-classing `WebMvcConfigurationSupport`. A `WebMvcConfigurerAdapter` allows you to add to the auto-configured MVC support 
solution: 

issue: ok, will that not prevent the mvc autoconfiguration? ok!  thank you very much! 
solution: 

issue: I'm looking for a proper way to inject my processing code into configuration properties binding pipeline. I need to decode a few values set up in application.yml. I tried couple options that work for `@Value("${app.prop}")`, including custom `PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer` and custom `Environment` but none of them seem to work for `@ConfigurationProperties(prefix="app")`... Inspecting `ConfigurationPropertiesBinder` and `ConfigurationPropertiesBindingPostProcessor` gives a feeling that their ecosystem is quite closed for injections from the outside 
solution: 

issue: Excuse me ,you can't log in to the Getting desktop client.dit you run into this problem? 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona So to customise that JSON response do I need to implement ErrorController? 
solution: 

issue: If you have both, then your app is configured as an MVC app. And you can't mix MVC and WebFlux endpoints in an application. 
solution: 

issue: Where is `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security.oauth2.resource.AuthoritiesExtractor` since 2.0.0.M4 gone? Same for the famous `PrincipalExtractor` and `ResourceServerProperties` 
solution: 

issue: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.0.0-M5-Release-Notes ok have it somewhere in the security project. thanks @wilkinsona 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll it may sound scary but it's not really  For example, https://gist.github.com/edudar/7e1c04dcb47ac5b0f303a8a44ec7409e or https://gist.github.com/edudar/4c3c46431eebcc2ad55d462bb77fd2c0 successfully process `@Value("${...}")` @snicoll I had custom `PropertySource` for that same purpose in 1.5 but it stopped working in 2.0. It's possible to tweak it a little to make it compatible but the whole approach does not sound good to me. It was not compatible with `spring-cloud` also, so I'm looking for a nicer way to do things 
solution: 

issue: I think you lost me. Can you please share a small sample we can run ourselves? I don’t see the link with configprops but looking at a sample should help with that 
solution: 

issue: Yes, I’d just do that for now. I haven’t figured out yet if we can fix 12786 and not regress the fix for 11569. 
solution: 

issue: this seems like something silly I'm  missing but I did this same scenario to another Entity and it worked fine 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll here simple project with both approaches as separate modules: https://github.com/edudar/spring-boot-encryption-1. I might be tracking down a wrong path though... 
solution: 

issue: @dsyer Thank you.  I am using 1.10.11-SNAPSHOT - I noticed you added that support.  Much appreciated. 
solution: 

issue: @ptahchiev no. It’s there to allow you to build the endpoints with a custom configuration. I think it’s misleading to swap a Spring Boot feature while keeping the same name. But it’s your app in the end 
solution: 

issue: has anyone tried spring rest docs with `RestAssuredMockMvc` recently? I can't find a way to integrate rest assured+mockmvc+spring rest docs with current version 
solution: 

issue: Question, i just watched the spring statemachine video, is this somewhat a simpler version of a bpm? or a complex one. not sure 
solution: 

issue: IIRC, it periodically checks for expired sessions in a background thread. I can’t remember the frequency of that check, but it means that a session may not actually be expired until the timeout period plus the checking internal has elapsed. 
solution: 

issue: Morning. I'm attempting to use spring core's NonNullApi but Eclipse isn't able to resolve `@org.springframework.stereotype.NonNullApi` in my package's `package-info.java` file. Is this an issue with Eclipse? 
solution: 

issue: Hi all.  If running in Docker, is the executable JAR file suitable, or should I use `java -jar`? 
solution: 

issue: `server.ssl.key-store` is Spring Boot’s property. The other one is JVM argument 
solution: 

issue: hi folks, i have a problem about url encoding.i want to send static encoded url such as "%2FWEB-INF%2Fviews%2Fjsp%2Fhello" as a pathvariable for request in spring mvc but i can't handle this request. is anyone has suggestion ? i am using spring boot 2.0 by the way 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona thanks for the response. You mention that there are no CloudWatch-specific properties for Micrometer in Boot 1.5 but what about 2.0.X? 
solution: I see that micrometer has a dependency for cloudwatch, I was just curious as to why there are no properties associated with it. Will see if I can ask someone on Micrometer team.. 

issue: has anyone tried to run spring-boot 2 with jdk9? 
solution: 

issue: @renannprado If you’re considering Java 9, I’d jump straight to 10 now as 9’s already out of (public) support from Oracle That warning’s benign and can be ignored 
solution: @zeagord Not that I’m aware of. It’s from, IIRC, CGLib that’s used by Spring Framework. It’s possible a change has been made beneath Boot that’s fixed it.. 

issue: You can check this - https://github.com/joshlong/spring-boot-and-java-10 
solution: Include ```<dependency>     <groupId>javax.xml.bind</groupId>     <artifactId>jaxb-api</artifactId> </dependency>```. 

issue: still it doesn't work I wonder why the spring-boot docs doesn't cover the specifics of jdk9 + spring 
solution: 

issue: @edudar I did not, thanks for the reminder 
solution: @wilkinsona I understand... I just meant that since it's not as trivial as with jdk8, there should be at least a link from the spring-boot docs to the github wiki you just sent methanks btw!. 

issue: > Hi all.  If running in Docker, is the executable JAR file suitable, or should I use `java -jar`?Stupid question?I tried it, but got a weird error `standard_init_linux.go:190: exec user process caused "no such file or directory"` 
solution: 

issue: @renannprado if Hibernate relies on jaxb and doesn’t declare a dependency on it, you might want to check their tracker to see if they have an issue regarding this. if they want to best support users on Java 9+, they probably should declare jaxb as a dependency 
solution: 

issue: I'm sorry, I think I misunderstood what you saidYes, indeed the issues are not related to spring, but I though this would be the right place to ask 
solution: 

issue: Fair enough. That’s pure FUD but I suspect your tech lead isn’t going to take our word for it 
solution: If it helps, start.spring.io is running on Java 9 now I believe. > relies on reflection at runtimeThat’s a common feature across many, many frameworks in the Java ecosystem, BTW. Lots of parts of Java EE use reflection these days, including JAX-RS which your lead wants you to use…. 

issue: @filiphr The `EnableConfigurationProperties` annotation shouldn’t affect the creation of `WebSocketMessageBrokerConfiguration` What does the auto-configuration report (run with --debug) should you when it’s not working? 
solution: 

issue: Let me try that. I was using the `WebApplicationContextRunner`,  is that the same as starting a normal spring boot app? 
solution: 

issue: That is really strange. Can you share some code that reproduces that behaviour please? I’d like to understand what’s going on. 
solution: 

issue: Thanks @developer-guy It’s hard to say why it’s not working as you haven’t shown the code that you’ve tried. Also, I’m not sure that allowing a view name to be passed in with the request is a good idea. It may allow a user to render something that they shouldn’t be able to see. 
solution: 

issue: Does anyone know what "Deprecated. Core classes are parameterized as of 2.0." means? See here https://docs.spring.io/spring-ldap/docs/current/apidocs/org/springframework/ldap/core/simple/SimpleLdapTemplate.html, I have spent a few hours trying to look up what it means but I have not found any leads. 
solution: 

issue: @filiphr It looks like JetBrains is aware of this limitation with the Spring Boot auto-detection facet. There is a YouTrack issue [here](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-133445). It does say its fixed however. 
solution: 

issue: I knew about that one @marcelvdh. With it you can mark any file as a Boot file, but it is annoying having to go through the Facet dialog and configuring it. 
solution: 

issue: when I start my application and it can't find the database ("No server chosen by WritableServerSelector...") the application exits. How can I make it continue the startup and autoconnect later when it can find the database? I don't want the app to finish. 
solution: 

issue: @ofabricio Try to set `spring.datasource.continue-on-error=true`https://stackoverflow.com/a/45410106 
solution: 

issue: @BenEfrati it didn't work. Does that work for mongodb? 
solution: @ofabricio You may be interested in https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/11325. When I looked back in December, an unreachable Mongo would not cause the application to fail to start up. 

issue: i don't understand well how is that related. But maybe you mean i should update the spring boot version? (we're using 1.5, and we can't update) I assume you're using the latest spring version? 
solution: 

issue: `bootDistTar` is exactly the same type of task as `distTar` so it should be configurable in the same way 
solution: 

issue: 'Sometimes'? Sounds like an environment issue. Turn on debug logging, download and diff the logs between a run that worked and a run that didn't. 
solution: 

issue: excellent.. thanks a lot, it's working 
solution: 

issue: Not yet, but writing something is on our radar: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/12941 
solution: 

issue: We have the bootjar being built into a openjdk docker image and running great. But how do we run the junit/mockmvc tests inside a docker container so the tests can run in the same environment? 
solution: 

issue: Sounds like you may just need to run your Maven or Gradle build in your Docker container 
solution: 

issue: Probably. The runtime one is purposefully slim though and won't have things like gradle and possibly git. I'd hoped to find some standard practise on this but can't find anything. Is there a springboot build target which bundles the test classes in a jar? 
solution: 

issue: ok, i'll do that 
solution: Looks like you should be able to put `spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.integration.envers.enabled=false` in a profile-specific configuration file. 

issue: @wilkinsona  I will try to recreate the problem in a UT and file an issue if I am able 
solution: 

issue: wait, spring boot won't be providing javax.persistence? or is that provided by a spring data included bom? or just not at all 
solution: 

issue: Hi, guys. I was searching for an interesting Java open source project to contribute and found this one interesting, once I use it in my daily work. 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona  according to what I found, were aren't picking that dep up in our layer though... and I probably didn't want full hibernate in our "entities" layer... or something... and spring-xml is also not managed? (that's a real wtf to me, that a spring project isn't managed), and I'm sure more (I can forgive guava, it's not that big of a deal). Also we can't just upgrade hibernate, because we depend on hibernate search, so now I guess I have to figure out what jpa api version I need? and what the right artifact is for this. IMHO, what a mess :/ 
solution: 

issue: I should let work go until monday though 
solution: 

issue: #13113 - and here searching for already reported feature request proved usefull and prevented my from requesting duplicate... 
solution: 

issue: eh, I opened an issue, at least it will be documented, https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-16817 
solution: 

issue: yeah... I actually think it might be a problem with intellij parsing it, not with the test itself, but now I've discovered another issue 
solution: 

issue: How to configure spring boot to test a existing server endpoints, the  `@SpringBootTest` seems like to start the spring container. 
solution: 

issue: Looks like a GitHub problem. It’s showing 22 closed issues but not listing them 
solution: definitely looks like a glitch https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/milestone/109?closed=1 has pagination support but no content. 

issue: I think that you can't run rabbitmq embedded in the same was as activeMQ 
solution: 

issue: There is also https://github.com/AlejandroRivera/embedded-rabbitmq (I've never used it though) The reason why you can't run it embedded is that RabbitMQ is not written in Java 
solution: 

issue: @pmihalcin The only difference between the two is Docker. Neither is embedding everything. The Docker approach has the advantage of you not having to have Erlang installed You could take it a step further with Testcontainers. That’ll integrate starting and stopping the Docker container into your tests. It works pretty well in my experience; we use it in Boot’s CI (although not specifically with Rabbit). 
solution: 

issue: ah.. good to know.. thanks a lot for the information 
solution: 

issue: Hi all,i have a quick question, i created some  @ConfigurationProperties and would like to use these to set the fixedDelayString of a @Scheduled function but spring isn't able to resolve the property yet.i found this (very old) issue https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/2282 But i dont know how to fix this with @Scheduled.any tips ? 
solution: 

issue: What json path? `json-path` is managed awesome :) 
solution: 

issue: If you’re doing a single page app that will probably be implemented differently on the backend then if you’re using something like Thymeleaf 
solution: 

issue: @shakuzen This application uses Spring Cloud and Finchley.RC1 is not compatible with Boot 2.0.2: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/13126 So we'll need to wait for another RC or the final release before this application can use Spring Boot 2.0.2. 
solution: 

issue: @sauravsingh29 I think you could refactor most of it inside a `ExchangeFilterFunction` that you can configure at the `WebClient.Builder` level. Instead of throwing exceptions, you should probably `return Mono.error(new MyException());`. Throwing should work anyway, but using Mono.error is more idiomatic and easier to read when you're composing a pipeline. 
solution: 

issue: Readded Dropwizard. Comparison is not entirely fair since Micrometer timers are added through the Micrometer SpringMVC integration and I added the Dropwizard metrics by simply adding timers in the SpringMVC mappings. However, time spend in GC is significantly reduced with the Dropwizard version. Very curious if the fix @shakuzen mentioned might have an effect, I’ll see if I can get Spring Boot 2.0.2 running using a Spring Cloud snapshot 
solution: 

issue: @utwyko thank you for experimenting and sharing the results. This is interesting. If you have any profiling results that point to where a lot of the garbage is being generated, that could help find where might be improved. Since it seems now the GC pressure is coming from micrometer, feel free to also share on the micrometer Slack. Boot 2.0.2 should work with the latest Cloud snapshots, I believe. And another RC will hopefully be released this week. I suspect the fix I mentioned won't be the whole explanation, but it should help some, nonetheless. 
solution: 

issue: Could setting the publishing interval really high confirm if that is the issue in this case or not? IIUC that issue is only when publishing the metrics via statsd, no? That is to say, the garbage mentioned in that issue only happens at publish time, not at recording time. Looking closer, I guess the issue described is two fold so it is both recording and publishing time. So much for my idea then. 
solution: 

issue: Does anyone know how to *disable* metrics collection with WebFlux functional API? I'm having an issue with too many uri tags for requests (db proxy). The management.metrics.web.server.auto-time-requests property doesn't seem to work for WebFlux... @snicoll thanks! Ill try that 
solution: 

issue: @utwyko unless you need statsd for some reason, `micrometer-registry-graphite` should produce a lot less garbage. doesn't have the same payload _per event_ model as statsd @dave-maldonado you can also define a `WebFluxTagsProvider` to customize the tags that are generated can achieve the same as well with `MeterFilter#replaceTagValues` 
solution: 

issue: Have you wrapped them in an endpoint by using `@ServletEndpoint` and `Supplier<EndpointServlet>`? 
solution: 

issue: I'll have to double check then. I am fairly certain that not everything was in there. Can it be because my servlets are lazy initialized? Done https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/13186. Just for my info, if I expose the servlets directly, then I can't customize their url mappings, right? They be directly taken from from `@RequestMapping`(s) 
solution: 

issue: Any context on why Boot still relies on snakeyaml 1.19 instead of 1.20 (as recommended by Spring core)? just ran into the issue today. Seems like it was a known thing. Is it worth trying to upgrade Boot and send a PR or is there a deeper issue waiting? 
solution: 

issue: are you using jackson for deserializing ? 
solution: 

issue: @rajjaiswalsaumya as andy says aswell, it would be better to let your clients send null (or even better dont include null values at all).But, as a work around you could have a look at this: http://apieceofmycode.blogspot.nl/2015/05/json-jackson-custom-deserializer-to.html with some small modifications you should be able to do what you want (but it really is a hack) 
solution: 

issue: A bean with an `@EventListener` method is adapted into an `ApplicationListener` 
solution: No, it doesn’t have to be `@Component` for `@EventListener` methods to be picked up, it just has to be a bean.. If you want to some form of dynamic registration (I think that’s what you’re asking for), I think you’ll have to implement `ApplicationListener` directly rather than using `@EventListener`. 

issue: In that class in line 55 a PropertyPlaceholderHelper is created with the ignoreUnresolvablePlaceholders set to false we are loading a yml file with properties for which we don't want a exception to be triggered if a placeholder is not resolvable Unfortunatelly with spring-boot 2.0.2 we get the following exception: https://pastebin.com/1FcCsueq my question is, is there a way to override the PropertyPlaceholderHelper in such a way it uses the ignoreUnresolvablePlaceholders set to true in the following example is {JOB_ID} a spring boot placeholder? 
solution: 

issue: `NoSuchMethodFound` on what exactly? There was some YAML compatiblity  change in 5.0.5, have you tried that? (Spring Boot `2.0.2`) 
solution: I did, it was some method on org.yaml.snakeyaml.nodes.ScalarNode, reproducing now so I can get a full stack and raise a github issue on it if that wasn't expected. 

issue: @Razi007 I am facing this isuue while loading env_variable from ebs in spring-boot 2.0.1 Failed to bind properties under 'spring.datasource.username' to java.lang.String: getting errors while loading env 
solution: 

issue: ah the origin tracker. Got it. 
solution: @wilkinsona `ApplicationEventMulticaster` kinda works, but since listeners added to it trigger upon *all* events the listener must accept a generic `ApplicationEvent` and check if it's an instance of the desiderd event subclass.. 

issue: or maybe is there a way to quote the symbol $ inside a property value in the yml file? 
solution: 

issue: If you remove the MediaType from the route and add it to the @RequestMapping(..., consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_UTF8_VALUE) i believe that should work 
solution: 

issue: @nnanda2016 That’s not really a Spring Boot question as the functional web framework is part of Spring Framework. 
solution: oh…my apologies…is there a separate channel?  or, just stackoverflow. 

issue: but I don’t see the bean changing after I change the message…is it because I ‘m not using a config server? 
solution: 

issue: Unless `EcmDbSvc` is an unusually named Data JPA repository, it’s not going to be found by component scanning:> By default, it configures an in-memory embedded database, scans for @Entity classes, and configures Spring Data JPA repositories. Regular @Component beans are not loaded into the ApplicationContext. 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona   thank you, I will try the suggestions and get back with my findings 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona in regards to https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/13186. You told me that if the `DispatcherServlet` is not initialized it will get initialized. However, that is not the case. I exposed the `DispatcherServlets` and they are only displayed if the servlet is initialized before 
solution: 

issue: I know what the issue is The name is wrong. I have a custom name for the servlet in the `ServletRegistrationBean` and the name of the servlet is does not match that It can't find the child The problem is here https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/8364d121b1e39c23e872dd7ce587681e30675703/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/web/mappings/servlet/DispatcherServletsMappingDescriptionProvider.java#L85 The bean name is used for the name when it is searched in tomcat 
solution: 

issue: I get it. The only way would be if the `ServletRegistrationBean` are used as well. I think it's quite easy to add that. I can try over the weekend to provide a PR for that (in case you are open for that) 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll Thank you so much, `HibernateJpaAutoConfiguration` works like a charm. Will use it as a workaround until I upgrade to 2.0 
solution: Alright, I am glad you found a workaround. 

issue: Hello.I'm trying to create a form with spring mvc/Thymeleaf. I want users to post some Messages. ```    @GetMapping("/contact")    public String getContact(Model model) {        Message message = new Message();        message.setCreationDate(Instant.now());        message.setStatus(MessageStatus.CREATED);        model.addAttribute("message", message);        return "contact";    }    @PostMapping("/contact")    public String postMessage(@Valid Message message, BindingResult bindingResult, Model model) {        if (!bindingResult.hasErrors()) {            log.info("Sending message by {} - Message : {}", message.getCustomer().getEmail(), message.getContent());            messageService.save(message);        }        return "contact";    }```The Message entity has a `@NotNull` constraint for `creationDate` and `status` attributes. When posting a message, I have an error because `bindingResult` contains invalid data : creationDate and status are null... How to avoid this ? I can add hidden fields in my form, containing `creationDate` and `status` values, but it can't be acceptable because users may have access to it and can technically modify those attributes. 
solution: 

issue: junit5 when used the constructor based injection in Kotlin I am getting `java.lang.Exception: Test class should have exactly one public zero-argument constructor` 
solution: 

issue: Hello, not directly related to Spring boot, but a more general question on Spring and AOP: in an application using a lot of @Aspect  1) How would you ensure the correct aspects ordering with @Order, knowing that you can't have a central place to define the ordering since these aspects may reside in different libs used by different applications?2) How would you list all the @Aspect present in the application context, an their order ?3) Does it make sense to use @DeclarePrecedence in a separate @Aspect to ensure the ordering instead of @Order for such a use case ? 
solution:

issue: ah, was missing the version... wonder why all examples I've seen so far don't have a version another issue... can't get hot swapping to work. I added `spring-boot-devtools` to the dependencies. Using IntelliJ saving the file / building the project doesn't update anything. I reload the page and it's still showing the old content using kotlin... and I built (/recompiled) before and it didn't work. But now I tried again and it worked... hm :) thanks is it advisable for a newbie to use webflux? I have experience with reactive programming but with spring none at all I mean spring or spring boot in general @snicoll thanks! It's working now concerning webflux, I'll use a while first mvc... it seems to be better to get familiar with the framework

solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona @dsyer Finally found the source of the problem with my thin boot app.  What I had earlier referred to as a class loader problem turned out to be a case of the SSL stack of the VM being initialized too soon when the Thin launcher was resolving dependencies using https to our internal repository.  Since we store our trust store passwords encrypted I could not specify it on the command line with the -Djavax.net.ssl.* parameters.  I was setting these properties programmatically in my SpringBoot application.  But since the launcher already initialized the stack (when these params were null), it was not considering my trust stores.  When I switched to using --thin.offline everything worked as expected.  Using a combination of dry run and offline will do the trick for me.  I just thought I'd point this out in case others face this problem.  Not sure that there is anything that the thin launcher can/should do in these situations

solution: 

issue: local it works fine 
solution: 

issue: if you run in containers there's also a "Fractional" setting in 8+ in 11? that will be on by default that looks right... btw, you shouldn't have those processes running as root on a production system k, just making sure ;) and can't answer regarding the port, not enough info your config files? maybe check `netstat -L -v` 
solution: 

issue: :) 
solution: you sure its not some access issue on the vserver? maybe theres input/output access you need to configure on the network, firewall, etc?. 

issue: no its not was. yesterdayi run a other service by java -jar (not as systemd) and it worked 
solution: that doesn't even look like the whole output. 

issue: we've been using vaadin for years now, every time we upgrade they break a lot of things, and deprecate more we're looking at leaving it behind for  something that's a bit more stable also it's really really easy to make exploitable code in vaadin less easy in 8 but still easy we're talking about leaving vaadin instead of trying to migrated to 10 when the time comes 
solution: 

issue: because of some of the magical things it does... also I dislike its inconsistent interfaces... if I have 2 different "components" like "grid" and "button" they have to have different listeners even if those listeners do the exact same thing, because the listener interfaces are different without any seeming reason, so you end up duplicating code/or with more objects in memory 
solution:

Reference issue: https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core/issues/375 . I trying to get my head around (Spring 5 user as well) if there is any equivalent currently for achieving async dispatching of events between modules of the same app. E.g receiving requests from the web layer - buffering and async processing them in another 'Service' through an eventBus construct. Any point to the right direction would be appreciated.  One of the other options in order to achieve the same thing  is to use Spring's @Async / Executor constructs and async process my incoming messages. Thanks for any tips.

The problem here is that it is actually `org.springframework.kafka.core.KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;`I was following this docs: https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/reference/htmlsingle/#quick-tour

issue: @worldtiki I'm not sure Spring is the right level of abstraction for that. This would probably belong in the Netty pipeline itself, as the compression is dealt with there Spring Boot has a closed issue about this - since this is a server concern, and not generally supported. I don't know if Netty supports that. (see https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/11827)

issue: Hi there, anyone experienced StackOverflowError when using log4j starter with Spring Boot 2? As soon as I add     compile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-log4j2') I get the following stackoverflow 
solution: 

issue: I'm by no means expert on maven, but according to the docs, if somebody adds the actuator and pulls therefore transitively the logging dependency, he/she would need to exclude it explicitly there as well or am I wrong? 
solution: 

issue: I think you are wrong. The exclusion in the docs for Maven will apply whenever `spring-boot-starter` is seen in the dependency graph IIRC, with Gradle the exclusion has to either be specified once for each time `spring-boot-starter` appears in the graph or it needs to be declared configuration-wide as you have done That’s not exactly equivalent, but it’s probably the most concise way to get what you want 
solution: 

issue: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-logging.html#howto-configure-log4j-for-logging right? Ah I see there is an `exclusions` block yeah, for gradle the equivalent is the global configuration I guess :D at least I don't know any better way Thanks a lot for you support.

solution: 

issue: Are there any plans to make @Mockbean and @Spybean not recreate Spring Context everytime a new test comes up with a different set of mocked beans? This would massively speed up a lot of CI pipelines. 
solution: @jaakko-solita Strictly speaking, it’s not every time a new test comes up. It’s everytime a new combination of mocked or spied beans is used. The problem is that changing the beans that are mocked or spied, changes the set of beans that are available for dependency injection. A new context is needed so that dependency injection is performed using the right set of beans.. 

issue: so camel's zipkin spring boot thing uses wildcard mappings to properties ```# the zipkin service namecamel.zipkin.server-service-mappings.*=service1camel.zipkin.client-service-mappings.*=service2``` like ^^

issue: If you are, thread dumps taken at regular intervals during startup will make it obvious as you’ll see `SecureRandom` in the stacks Looks like Docker is affected by the same problem: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26021181/not-enough-entropy-to-support-dev-random-in-docker-containers-running-in-boot2d 
solution: 

issue: (a common work-around is to use `/dev/urandom` instead. It should never block.) 
solution: I hestitate to recommend that workaround as it can have an impact on your application’s security. People who know why more than I do about random number generation seem to be split on whether or not it’s worth worrying about.

issue: I upgraded my existing project to spring boot 2 . After this once I login `SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication()` is giving me always null. Is there any changes in spring security 5 is causing it?. I am expecting the session based user login should work like previous Can any one provide me a clue what I am missing in spring boot 2 
solution: 

issue: this is weird. this works:> compile group: 'org.springframework.boot', name: 'spring-boot-starter-undertow', version: '2.0.3.RELEASE’but not this:> compile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-undertow:2.0.3.RELEASE') isn’t the latter a shorter version?

solution: 

issue: few things:- Remove `throws` from method signature ( we dont need that for unchecked exceptions)- you can use `.stream().anyMatch(type -> type.getClass() == clazz)` yea my bad…`findFirst()` is fine 
solution: 

issue: Ok, so - we’re getting this warning every time a RestClient is sending a request with a Protobuf payload (`Failed to evaluate Jackson deserialization for type […]`). There’s no error, and the payload is successfully sent in the correct format. It seems that it’s `org.springframework.http.converter.json.AbstractJackson2HttpMessageConverter#logWarningIfNecessary` that writes this warning when the `RestTemplate` tries to guess which accept-header to set (in `org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate.AcceptHeaderRequestCallback#doWithRequest`). It does this by looping through all `HttpMessageConverter` beans to check if they support the payload type. Which `MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter` doesn’t (but it still insists on logging the warning). 
solution: 

issue: I’ve tried setting the logging-level to ERROR for the MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter, but that doesn’t take. I’ll dig into that - but in the mean time — does any recognize the issue and have a good work-around? :) 
solution: 

issue: (fyi - solved that logging issue.. was trying to set it from an auto configuration using `@PropertySource`. That doesn’t work. However, using an ApplicationContextInitializer in the autoconfiguration module works fine) 
solution: 

issue: Using `@PropertySource` with Spring Boot is not recommended (for namely the reason you’ve just discovered) 
solution: 

issue: You should probably try to get rid of the NoopHostnameVerifier. If you’re not checking that the SSL certificate’s hostname matches the hostname that you called, then you could actually be calling anything.

issue: hey everyone, not sure if this is completely related to Spring Boot or Spring MVC. But when I have custom servlet with their own endpoints mapped to lets say `/custom/**` and I have the actuator active as well. Then The actuator is exposed through `/actuator/` and `/custom/actuator`.  And I think that the security that I am doing with `EndpointRequest` is only taking into consideration the `/actuator` and not the other servlets. Is there a way for me not to have the actuator endpoints in my custom servlet? Or something more generic in my custom dispatcher to have only beans from that context and not the parent one?

issue: Not yet: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/12228

issue: There’s nothing available out of the box in Spring Boot or Spring Framework. You could, perhaps, use a child context that’s closed and a new one refreshed when you want to change the active profiles. @kennethk91 Not that I can recall. Boot’s been on Flyway 5.0.7 since 2.0.0RC2. You could check for yourself by looking through the GitHub milestones for 2.0.1, 2.0.2, and 2.0.3 2.0.1: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/milestone/982.0.2: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/milestone/1092.0.3: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/milestone/112 
solution: 

issue: Hi! I just upgraded from 2.0.0 to 2.0.3, and flyway does not seem to run anymore. Has there been any changes regarding flyway in 2.0.3? 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona Thanks for the suggestion. I downgraded to 2.0.1 and the problem still occurs. I can't see any mentions of flyway in the 2.0.1 milestone. 
solution: Well that’s narrowed things down a bit at least. What, exactly, is the problem?. 

issue: When running my component tests I get "org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLException: Table "TABLE_NAME" not found". I assume this is because flyway does not run, I also can't see flyway in the logs when starting up the tests.

issue: i haven’t heard of tomcat deleting an unused temp folder before is it inside a docker container? 
solution: 

issue: @chad_d_stud_twitter I believe it is the OS that is removing the folder after some time since tomcat puts it in the OS' temp directory by default. In my case this is happening on an AWS EC2 instance. But tomcat doesn't recreate the folder if it gets deleted and I'd rather keep the folder in the temp files so it clears out the files periodically. Here is an issue created on Github that explains what is happening. https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/9616 
solution: 

issue: i’ll play around with this because i sure as hell am not ditching all the crap i just did in the last three months >:(

solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona thank you very much. I will do the sampling and share the results here. Unfortunately, we cannot now migrate our project to boot 2.0 due to some compatibility issues. 
solution: 

issue: I am checking that now. It appears the Stop button sends the SIGINT. I'll try using the `jps` command. @nnanda2016 though the IDE sends SIGINT when I sent SIGTERM from the command line I did not see any of my graceful shutdown statements triggering. That `jps` command is useful. Thanks :) 
solution: 

issue: It's only needed at runtime and test runtime but not when running as a fat jar. 
solution: I’d use a custom configuration and add it to the classpath of both of those then. That will be easier than adding it more generally and then trying to remove it. Not sure about that part. I don’t know how IDEA figures out the classpath. I suspect that’s going to make things complicated.

issue: Hello where is possible to show the roadmap of spring boot. I am wondering when the version 2.0.4.RELEASE will be released and also the version 2.1.0.RELEASE. I would like to know also what are the differences between version 2.0.* and 2.1.* ; I have seen in master the version of Apache Tomcat has been upgraded to 9.0.* that's all ? 
solution: 

issue: Thanks. Unfortunately, I’m not sure there’s much we can do about as the code’s already been optimized at least once. I seem to recall that you said you had 1000s of properties that were being bound? Is that correct or have I confused you with someone else? 
solution: @selimok I know you already do. I’m suggesting you may want to consider if that’s the right approach. From what you’ve said, it would appear that it’s not meeting your needs so perhaps you should look at an alternative. Do you need everything that `@ConfigurationProperties` and externalised configuration provides?.

issue: During application shutdown Is there a way to know whether the Tomcat ThreadPoolExecutor shuts down before the Spring ApplicationContext or is the order undefined? The https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/4657 issue shows listening to a ContextClosedEvent could allow me to ensure the ThreadPoolExecutor shuts down gracefully before the Spring ApplicationContext is closed. That seems to ensure that the `ThreadPoolExecutor` shuts down before the `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` closes. It gets a little more complicated when I have another component to close, such as a Kafka consumer.

issue: hi folks. i have a question about spring boot and tests. I'm using the SpringBootTest annotation and my test class is extending AbstractTestNGSpringContextTests.what is the best way to override a property programatically?the use case is the following:  spring boot app connects to another service (kafka) that is launched prior to the test (by overriding the springTestContextBeforeTestClass) and runs on a random port.because it's running on a random port, I can't just put `port: 123` in the application yml 
solution: 

issue: I’m not familiar with TestNG’s lifecycle, but, if you can, you should add a `PropertySource` to the `Environment` that sets a property containing the port that Kafka’s listening on. I’m not sure if the `Environment` will be available at that point though.

issue: Goal, if not clear, is to get my `@Configuration` loaded as early as possible so I can add aspect singletons to bean factory so they get applied to beans as they are loaded 
solution: 

issue: Thanks @wilkinsona that helps frame what I am doing a lot. I’m not sure if you have `SleuthAnnotationAutoConfiguration` checked out, I can send a link if not. In the closure of that code, they are using `DynamicMethodMatcherPointcut` to dynamically add aspects to beans. I am doing something similar, creating a test framework that can apply an enumerated list of predefined aspects to pointcuts that are defined in properties I haven’t been able to find a lot of examples of `DynamicMethodMatcherPointcut` in the wild, so I am templating off `SleuthAnnotationAutoConfiguration`. A key point here is the aspects are *not* configured using annotations, so `AnnotationAwareAspectJAutoProxyCreator` is not an option

You could probably write a custom health indicator to do that for you. It could return `DOWN` to begin with. Then `UP` once registration has happened (assuming you can detect that)..

issue: Hi guys, I'm trying to customize the ObjectMapper used by MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter when deserialising controller parameters (I have an interface and want to map the implementation). To do so I’m creating a bean of type `Module` inside an autoconfiguration where I register an abstractTypeResolver and other configurations. I was excepting that would automatically customize the objectMapper used by MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter, but actually it uses a objectMapper that does not contain any of my customisations. Any clue on that?

Make sure it's not in a location that's scanned by your application.@bclozel  yes it’s declared in a `spring.factories` and it’s in a package not scanned by the application. If I run it in debug mode I can see that my `Module` is taken in account by `StandardJackson2ObjectMapperBuilderCustomizer.configureModules()`

issue: I just tried it with /images/icons.svg and its still null {resource={social_svg=null, light_svg=null, regular_svg=null, solid_svg=null} oh so I am using both thymeleaf and Vue.js and I need to pass the hashed URLs to Vue so I'm declaring a javascript variable in thymeleaf and having Vue pick it up so it can use the correct hashed URLs because I can't use thymeleaf ${ } expressions in my single-file Vue components but resourceUrlProvider.getForLookupPath("/images/icons.svg") works perfectly fine inside a @ControllerAdvice I can get the hashed URLs and add them to a hashmap, and add the map to the Model I just felt it was kind of wasteful to repeat this operation on every http request

issue: I'm working with RestTemplateBuilder and trying to work out if I can set a global connect + read timeout (and a few other things). I know I can call setConnectTimeout manually but ideally I want to do this globally in case someone forgets.  Essentially I'm looking to do what RestTemplateAutoConfiguration is doing plus set a few other values. Any ideas? I did wonder about extending RestTemplateAutoConfiguration and overriding the restTemplateBuilder bean definition e.g. super.restTemplateBuilder + customizations but didn't seem quite right. I does seem to work however. 
solution: 

issue: good point but the problem is there are cases when the requestbody is a well-formed json object but while the endpoint was processing the data, it failed. I would log that error to a db with the corresponding json request 
solution: 

issue: That’s not a JSON request at that point. It’s a POJO to which some of the JSON has been bound. 
solution: 

issue: @bclozel yes,  the `uri` tag is the reason, both path and query part change with almost every request. I guess it would be hard to find a solution for every use case, I was thinking about adding a hint in the reference documentation or javadoc. 
solution: That's no what I meant. Do you have something that shows that the number of url/path tags are getting out of control?. 

issue: @marceloverdijk if it was working out of the box in 1.5, I wouldn’t have said “no” to your initial question :) > is the logging configuration doing something special to make it work? Yes Binding the map directly as a config props is a very bad idea in its own right, please don’t do that 
solution: 

issue: Thanks @tkvangorder, that's basically what I was thinking.  I just figured sub-classing RestTemplateAutoConfiguration would have the same result but mean I don't have to duplicate the code.  Seems to work ok.  Was just unsure as I figured RestTemplateAutoConfiguration should maybe expose properties to set up global defaults. Could raise a feature and send a PR but wasn't sure if it was useful.

issue: @snicoll I'm using a dedicated class now and it works with `Map<String, String`, thx! 
solution: 

issue: I think that you can't do this with Spring. You need something else that would do that analysis on the incoming file. Have a look at apache tika 
solution: 

issue: yes. the substring thing? what i meant was maybe spring data jpa had an implementation simplifying it

solution: 

issue: The fact the server’s running in a container should make no difference. As long as the client trusts the server’s certificate and that the hostname in the certificate matches the name of the host to which the client sent the request it should work. 
solution: 

issue: is there a way I can specify relative path in application.properties. I have `src/main/resources/application.properties` and also src/main/resources/config` now I would like to add property in application.properties `spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri=config` but is not working. I have tried following: `spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri=classpath:config` 
solution: @springroll12 The filters and their mappings are logged during startup. I believe that logging will reflect the ordering of the filters. @bigbang4u2_twitter Paths will be relative to the JVM’s working directory. The location of the properties file that contains the value will have no effect.. 

issue: @wilkinsona Thanks for the help - when you are talking host are you meaning the swarm host or the hostname of the container ? The hostname of the container changes for every instance which is why we are seeing the problem.

issue: Hi, there is some way to customize the generated manifest.mf file when running `gradle bootRun`? 
solution: 

issue: @mzcu I don’t believe there is one. You can get the remote side using `org.springframework.http.server.reactive.ServerHttpRequest.getRemoteAddress()` but I don’t believe there’s a local equivalent. That said, if you’re happy dropping down to some code that’s more container-specific, you may be able to get at something via `getNativeRequest()` 
solution: 

issue: If I have an application where we use `RestTemplate` which is more or less deprecated, but we don't want to make that code reactive and at the same time don't lose any Spring magic – is using `WebClient` with `block()`the way going forward?
solution: `RestTemplate` is not really deprecated. It's just that we won't evolve it in the future. So sticking to `RestTemplate` is perfectly valid if it does what you need. Another way to put that is that if you need specific usage patterns like streaming, scatter/gatter or custom timeouts, this won't be covered by `RestTemplate` and you need to use `WebClient` instead. Now using `WebClient` in a blocking application is fine too. Using `block()` shouldn't hurt there and Spring MVC controller do partially support reactive return types.

Whenever I try to navigate from this page to say url2, it takes me to a page host/url2, dropping the service-name part. - Even if I hardcode the href for navigation, the service doesn't respond (503)when I submit the form.- If I type the host/service-name/url2, it gives me a proper page and submission of form again provides a 503 error ie service not available. - I want to clarify that on localhost I don't need the 'service-name' part since I already provide the IP and port.

issue: There should be some more information in the logs, but you have a property that begins `gesellschaftensuche.datasource` that, for whatever reason, cannot be bound to `com.dvag.devops.gesellschaftensuche.GesellschaftensucheConfiguration`. 
solution: 

issue: yes you are right`***************************\nAPPLICATION FAILED TO START\n***************************\n\nDescription:\n\nBinding to target org.springframework.boot.context.properties.bind.BindException: Failed to bind properties under 'gesellschaftensuche.datasource' to com.dvag.devops.gesellschaftensuchsucheConfiguration$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB$$dc6ac201 failed:\n\n    Property: gesellschaftensuche.datasource.schema\n    Value: null\n    Reason: must not be null\n\n\nAction:\n\nUpdate your application's configuration\n","logger_name":"org.springframework.boot.diagnostics.LoggingFailureAnalysisReporter","thread_name":"main","level":"ERROR","level_value":40000}`

issue: @steima can you not use `-Djava.io.tmpDir=/path/to/your/controlled/dir` to override this default location? I do not have much experience with JSPs, but could see embedded tomcat (Spring Boot 1.5.x) creates a lot of work directory under our controlled location

issue: do i set this request factory to my rest template instance ? 
solution: 

issue: This values depends on the external service and your business logic. There is no global magic numbers. If you want to provide custom error handling, you can use error handler ```https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/web/client/RestTemplateBuilder.html#errorHandler-org.springframework.web.client.ResponseErrorHandler-```

issue: Hi,All,I want to translate  the doc,What should I do ? 
solution: I don’t know why you want to translate the documentation, but before you spend a huge amount of time on it, I just want to make sure that you’re aware that we wouldn't accept a contribution that translated the documentation into another language. Unfortunately, we don’t have the time or resources to keep anything other than the English version up-to-date.. 

issue: Hey! I want to save legacy support for Dropwizard metrics and Spring Boot metrics 1.x , it is really? If someone do that, please help. (Micrometer - not for our project) 
solution: 

issue: It might be due to `@RequestScope`, I’m not sure of the lifecycle there. Nothing to do with Spring Boot, though. It’s Framework that manages the bean lifecycle.

solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona , actually, I'm trying to execute the tests, don't see any table created.. 
solution: @Vidyasagara-reddy When the tests are being run, Hibernate should be initialized and, with the right generate-ddl configuration, it should create the tables. If that’s not happening, it sounds like Hibernate may not be configured as you’ve described. 

issue: @Vidyasagara-reddy i think your properties file might not be loaded 
solution: 

issue: @halimpuckjava It’s difficult to advise without knowing the specific error that you’re seeing. For example, Jackson has some support for breaking circular references during serialization. JPA also supports bi-directional relationships so all the individual pieces should work. 
solution: 

issue: Hi is there a document to know the order in which spring events are published. I am looking for an event which will be published after the spring context is refreshed (especially after hitting the /refresh endpoint) and after the Eureka client registers itself. Currently it has been a trial and error for me. I tried to listen to `RefreshScopeRefreshedEvent`, it triggers when I hit the refresh endpoint, but post refresh the client registers to Eureka server. My use case is to send some metadata to Eureka after the client is refreshed. 
solution:

issue: @Ozymandy Ok, I can’t think of any other obvious reason why it wouldn’t work. Can you share some code that reproduces the problem? 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona duh that was dumb :) I had originally done that because my config class was named `HazelcastConfig` and I did’t have any strings in the `@Configuration` nor `@Bean` and I was still getting that error - maybe because there was already another bean by name `hazelcastConfig` somewhere. Thanks for pointing out the obvious :) 
solution: 

issue: I updated my sample to reflect - https://github.com/edeandrea/spring-boot-admin-hazelcast/tree/no-sba actually never mind - sorry figured it out

solution: 

issue: ```spring.data.mongodb.host=${MONGO_HOST}```im trying to use this value form environment variable but spring boot is not picking it upis there any issue? i found in docs somewhere that we can directly inject env variable in application.properties but its not picking it up in my case

issue: I'm using Gradle, I googled, but i do not know how to downgrade the version of the package :S I have this dependency related to HATEOAS `compile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-hateoas')` Thanks @SzymonZberaz_twitter , I'll try to improve my code using your improvement Thanks a lot @wilkinsona , sorry to bother you with such things ^^ Downgrading to 0.24.0 worked Thanks I bookmarked it ! :D 
solution: 

issue: No problem, I totally understand that choices have to be made. I'll stick with this version, and will be looking forward into the next releases.I'll do a small project that reproduces the behaviour and will share it on Github.Thanks a lot for the help.

solution: 

issue: @SubhamAshish Sorry, I meant “should not have to know”. Did you try using `mongo.host`? 
solution: 

issue: Yes, `@Endpoint` is just for Actuator 
solution: By filter, I assume that you mean a servlet `Filter`? It sounds like you may benefit from using a Spring MVC-specific API instead. Have you looked at `HandlerInterceptor`?. @edeandrea No. `RouterFunction` is part of the functional programming model where you don’t use annotations.. 

issue: there may be some helper code in Spring Security, I’m not sure. I’d recommend asking in https://gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-security

issue: [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/Qp3C/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/Qp3C/image.png) HI All ， I want builder Spring - boot  error:https://gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot 
solution: 

issue: Hi all, I'm trying to configure spring boot to use two datasources - as described in https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-data-access.html However, I'm having problems with it. ```@Bean@Primary@ConfigurationProperties("app.datasource")public DataSourceProperties dataSourceProperties() { return new DataSourceProperties();}@Bean@ConfigurationProperties("app.datasource2")public DataSourceProperties dataSource2Properties() { return new DataSourceProperties();}@Bean@Primary@ConfigurationProperties("app.datasource")public HikariDataSource dataSource() { return dataSourceProperties().initializeDataSourceBuilder().type(HikariDataSource.class).build();}@Bean@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "app.datasource2")public HikariDataSource dataSource2() { return dataSource2Properties().initializeDataSourceBuilder().type(HikariDataSource.class).build();}``` The datasource properties aren't populated with the values from application.yml```app:  datasource:    url: jdbc:mariadb://xxxxxxxxxxxxxx    username: xxxxxxxxx    password: xxxxxxxxx  datasource2:    url: jdbc:mariadb://xxxxxxxxxxxxxx    username: xxxxxxxxx    password: xxxxxxxxx``` Any ideas what I'm doing wrong? Don't know it it makes a difference, but web part is turned off``` spring:  main:    web-application-type: NONE``` and it's using webflux starter I also tried getting those values directly using @Value (as that work without problems in other parts of the application)However, they're still not populated Is it possible that property source for application.yml is not yet initialized in @Configuration class? I also tried adding `@PropertySource("classpath:/application.yml")` to configuration class, but it didn't make a difference Yes, in `/src/main/resources` The app was working fine with a single (autoconfigured) datasource Now I needed to introduce another, and can't get past configuration 
solution: 

issue: nope That error looks like it’s ignoring that code completely and the regular `DataSourceAutoConfiguration` is kicking in try to replace `app.datasource` by `spring.datasource` to see if that changes anything > And if I manually populate them in `public DataSourceProperties dataSourceProperties()` it works. I missed that. Then that yaml is not read I guess. 
solution: 

issue: @BALAJI1183 the answer also mentions a `ReadTimeoutHandler` @BALAJI1183 also, `Flux.timeout` is about throwing a timeout exception if the time between two elements is too long, whereas the read timeout at the netty level is about throwing an exception if you don't get data at all for a given time. Subtle difference, but can be important depending on your use case.Typically, if you're using a transport protocol that's sending padding information over the wire (to avoid the connection from being closed) and you're streaming data as it comes - both timeout configurations will behave differently 
solution: 

issue: I need to validate a field in request json to be NotNull, class Request{ @NotNull private String id;...} and use (@Valid Mono<Request> requestMono) in the controller mapping method. But found all null value requests are still coming through to my inner functions 
solution: 

issue: How would I use that? Is it a special property where I put in one bigger JSON object for anything that's not-so-simple to configure? Excellent, thanks a lot! Will give this a try. 
solution: 

issue: @mlk5060 if that condition is on user configuration, this will not work as you expect it to be. Please review the javadoc of `@ConditionalOnBean`

Am I missing something obvious? 
solution: 

issue: What doesn’t work exactly? `Service` also needs to have the same characteristics obviously It’s the exact same thing then @DoraRajappan thanks for the feedback, that’s very helpful. I’ve created https://github.com/spring-guides/tut-spring-security-and-angular-js/issues/186 
solution: 

issue: You can rename it to yml. Support in IDEs is not as good as properties so we’re sticking with that for now 
solution: 

issue: I found this posthttps://o7planning.org/en/10869/using-multiple-datasources-with-spring-boot-and-routingdatasourceBut there is a hardcoded package definition, like entity A should use postgresql and entity B should use mysql.In my case i would be independent

(i just found out this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34201135/spring-redis-read-configuration-from-application-properties-file but i dont have an application.properties file  ... i'm pretty new to the spring world) do you have any idea where to change this 'localhost:6379'?

issue: @denqxotl Have you tried the Spring Boot documentation? It's pretty extensive: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/ I'm trying to build Micrometer with some changes locally with a custom version number. Current master builds as 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT, but I can't seem to find where the version number is defined. The project seems to use spring-release-plugin (Gradle). Anyone here familiar with this? 
solution:

solution: @rajjaiswalsaumya check your response content-type. 

issue: @lpandzic yes i work  but there is some bugs (warning) with compatibilty wbtwen jdk and spring boot 
solution: I cant do that as there are multiple contenttype expected such as application/json, application/octetstream etc.. 

issue: @toolateitsme I am also learning  SpringBoot. But you do need to know what Spring Core is, Cause Spring Boot uses all of the Spring Core Concepts. So you should have some idea, how Dependency Injection works in Spring. Scope of Spring Beans, Configurations, IOC Container, etc.. 
solution: 

issue: `AtomicInteger n = registry.gauge("numberGauge", new AtomicInteger(0));n.set(1);` So technically this is why I need? 
solution: 

issue: Yeah, thank you a lot @kschlesselmann 
solution: 

issue: Yes because if you return null the auto-configuration kicks in anyway don’t do any of that is what I am saying 
solution: understood, I will go ahead and comment it out. Thank you very much for your assistance!. that will switch off the support completely. Then you can resume with whatever the boolean flag does. 

issue: Question about building a custom `EnvironmentPostProcessor` - when looking for properties using something like ```javaif (environment.getProperty(“some.prefix.some-property-name”, Boolean.class, true)) {```does this take into account spring boot’s relaxed binding? What if the user specifies `some.prefix.somePropertyName` in their `application.properties`/`application.yml`? Will that `EnvironmentPostProcessor` pick that up?When I write a unit test of my EnvironmentPostProcessor, it only picks up the property if I specifically use the uniform naming convention

issue: I'm trying to implement UserDetailsRepository in my project which is configured with EnableWebFluxSecurity. It doesn't look like UserDetailsRepository exists anymore and I can't find what replaced it if it did change. 
solution: 

issue: Ok, I managed to come across one example that uses ReactiveUserDetailsService. I'm guessing that is what is supposed to be used for webflux. It looks like it has the same findByUsername method.

solution: 

issue: @ltorzynski you’ve explained the technical details but not the use case Spring Boot handles a single `DispatcherServlet` with a single path (always as) so that use case of yours can still work just fine I suppose but they are features that were broken before and would be still now I assume you never were affected by them Then I am not following 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I am getting the following warning even though I have a `@Component` extending `org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` in my Spring Boot 2.0.4-RELEASE WebFlux application. Any ideas?```Streaming through a reactive type requires an Executor to write to the response.Please, configure a TaskExecutor in the MVC config under "async support".The SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor currently in use is not suitable under load.``` 
solution: 

issue: Because I have some urls that should not be mapped to spring 
solution: 

issue: Just to conclude here, registering your servlets in the application context doesn’t mean they are “mapped to Spring”. We register the servlets as regular servlets directly to the container. So having a dispatcherservlet on `/` and individual servlets to whatever mapping you need will work

The app starts, but fails with "required a bean of type 'javax.persistence.EntityManager' that could not be found." it works if i deploy it to a tomcat. Hibernate starts according to the log, and HibernateJpaAutoConfiguration ist loaded according to the log. I'm not sure where I should be looking next, could anyone give me a hint? We Autowire the entitymanager in a couple of places (constructor), not sure if that's the issue ah and this is on boot 1.4.2, we're not on 2 yet

issue: hi..in Spring Boot 2 application's test class how do I disable the actuator context from starting up? 
solution: 

issue: Hello. I'm trying to get around a dependency issue on a spring boot BuildProperties bean. My project is not a spring boot project, but it includes spring-boot-starter-security and spring-web. It also has a dependency on a library which autowires a BuildProperties bean. When I try to launch the application, I get a bunch of errors about no qualifying bean of type `org.springframework.boot.info.BuildProperties`. How can I include this bean in my project without importing all of spring boot, or converting my project to a spring boot project?
solution: @springroll12 Add a dependency on `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot` if you do not have one already and then declare a `BuildProperties` bean: [<-CODE->]

solution: 

issue: @snicoll oic, thanks. Curious, does "web flux" not work with `MockMvc`? and `WebTestClient` only works with a non mock server? 
solution: If you want a `WebTestClient` that works against your context, add `@AutoConfigureWebTestClient` (as you’d have to add `AutoConfigureMockMvc` in a MVC app). 

issue: hmm...  is `WebTestClient` poised in some way to replace `MockMvc`? are they just alternatives? or is there a strong reason to use one over the other? 
solution: 

issue: Yes, and `PropertyMapper` would be helpful for that I got that from the beginning 
solution: 

issue: exactly, you can do either way, we just felt we had a little better control of things using explicit bean definitions in our configuration classes. We also had a lot legacy projects that were not structured via the standard "boot way" and were doing things like component scanning from a generic root package "com.company.*" and they were unintentionally picking up shared beans. I think if you strongly encourage your 3rd-party users to use the standard boot layout and to also use `@SpringBootApplication` this would not be much of an issue. Legacy code, got to love it. 8) 
solution: 

issue: Do you have `actuator` on your classpath? @dantesun Based on the following message I don't think so```Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.springframework.boot.actuate.info.InfoContributor``` 
solution: @marcosbarbero I don’t have actuator. And I don’t want it in my project. Somehow other jars must contains the InfoContributor reference. I need to find out which one and exclude it.. 

issue: as far as I'm concerned it's only referenced on `actuator`, there might be a homegrown dependency referencing to this 
solution: @snicoll Yes I know, But There’re so many beans in my project, the exception is all I got. I need to find out which one …. 

issue: @snicoll OK, I’ll try the hard work ... 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll I would be very appreciate that the exception thrown by springframework( or spring boot) has more specific error message 
solution: You probably have a module that has the actuator and is compiled against it and then you’ve removed the dependency downstream. There’s nothing we can do about that. You can also add the actuator to your app and see what `InfoContributor` you have (probably a bean if you’ve done this right). 

issue: @snicoll This is my screen shot and you will understand my issue. ![alt](http://oi64.tinypic.com/n4ck82.jpg) 
solution: 

issue: It’s an JVM Error, not a Compile error 
solution: 

issue: One more reason why you shouldn’t be asking us to fix it The JVM throws an error because your project is broken, as I’ve indicated above. I gave you two concrete options to spot the error in your project already. Not sure what you expect from me

solution: I have a controller with a method that forwards a request like this:```@GetMapping("/internal/hystrix.stream")public ModelAndView forwardHystrixStream(Map<String, Object> model) {    return new ModelAndView("forward:" + managementBasePath + "/hystrix.stream", model);}```Is it possible to implement a functionally identical method using WebFlux instead of MVC?. 

issue: @breun the `ModelAndView` equivalent in WebFlux is `org.springframework.web.reactive.result.view.Rendering`; I think it does support redirection but not forwarding; if I remember correctly, forwarding is a Servlet concept that we chose not to support in WebFlux.

issue: @hughwphamill Spring Framework uses JIRA: see https://jira.spring.io/projects/SPR/summary 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys, has anyone tried to output XML while using the built in Spring RestController validation for RequestParams? I've added jackson-dataformat-xml as a dependency, and the validation is working fine, however, the correct response code and error message is only returned for empty or wrongly formatted parameters If the parameter is missing entirely, a 406 response code with empty body is returned, as if it couldn't find an interpretation for the error message, even though it's in the same format as the empty or wrongly formatted one.. If I simply change my "accept" header to "application/json" I am returned the correct response code with the error message in the body 
solution: 

issue: @hughwphamill the issue tracker for Spring Framework is at https://jira.spring.io/projects/SPR @raj there are no rooms for Spring Framework unfortunately. SO is the place to ask questions @dhaval24 there is no guarantee that `@PostConstruct` will run before all beans are created. It is invoked by the container once the dependencies for that particular bean are injected and before it is available in the context. That’s the wrong callback for whatever you’re trying to do. What is the use case? @dhaval24 not sure what you mean by escaping `,`. This is the default token to split items in a list. Is the target type of the property a `Collection` or an `Array`? @DoraRajappan I’ve replied you yesterday. Please move `UiApplication` to `org.life`

issue: The log even says its not found hibernate properties 
solution: 

issue: Thanks @snicoll is there something better I should be doing in my tests? 
solution: 

issue: oh .. you want to inject the class based on the properties file.. you need to implement a Factory pattern.. I don't know if Spring can automatically do that for you @bipulkmr if class is in classpath then it has a @component annotation.. then you can automatically use using @Autowired am not sure .. did you tried that? ApplicationContext context = new GenericXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");  Car car = (Car) context.getBean("carDetailsBean"); something like that

issue: I have a custom `WebServerFactoryCustomizer` but its not available for management port.

I tried playing around with `ServletManagementWebServerFactoryCustomizer` but it didn't work. Any pointers will be appreciated. 
solution: 

issue: I'm not saying it's not the `application` plugin, but it started complaining when we migrated to spring boot 2 and since reading the docs it seems the spring boot plugin automatically sets the mainClassName (like with spring boot 1), I was expecting that behaviour not to be different but it's different not yet, just the current docs

solution: 

issue: Hi all - we are investigating if we can run our Spring Boot 1.5.15 applications with OpenJDK10.

issue: your problem is specific to k8s then. It stats much faster on your machine? 
solution: 

issue: I think the problem is not about k8s.Because, when I manually exclude some spring beans like weblfux that I dont use on my project it is starting faster. 
solution: The description is a bit vague (and 100% cpu on startup is not a problem. Would you prefer it didn’t use the available resources?). 

issue: Anyone online ?  int numberOfDays = (int) ChronoUnit.DAYS.between(endDate, startDate);    System.out.println("--------days--------"+numberOfDays);    for(int i = 1; i < numberOfDays; i++){        System.out.println("--------days--------"+i);    } I am using this in the rest api code and her for loop is not working. it's does not print anything. 
solution: 

issue: @satijabharat_twitter maybe because endDate is after startDate? This will return a negative result and you loop expects a positive one. 
solution: 

issue: @bclozel @satijabharat_twitter You will not notice if numberOfDays is negative because you print --- before the value with no separation.

solution: @snicoll Yes, adding the below config worked:```@Configurationpublic class HibernateConfig {    @Autowired    private CacheManager cacheManager;    @Bean    public HibernatePropertiesCustomizer hibernatePropertiesCustomizer() {        return hibernateProperties -> hibernateProperties.put(ConfigSettings.CACHE_MANAGER, cacheManager);    }}```This way Hibernate seems to use the same cache manager. I'm noticing some other unexpected behaviour, but might be unrelated, so will dig into that.Note also the `/actuator/metrics/cache.gets` now return correct data like gets, puts etc., albeit very broad (not per cache).Did Spring Boot ever considered exposing JCache statistics as part of the Caches endpoint in case the user us using JCache?Anyway , thx a lot for your help!. 

issue: That’s more of a micrometer question to me It’s not really about JCache though, JCache is very limited in what they expose. 
solution: Which does not make it that useful to be honest. I would like to know per cache what the hit/miss rate so independent caches can be fine tuned. Yes that's more of a micrometer question indeed.. It’s not exposed for JCache because the spec does not expose that information (as far as I remember, it’s been a while). Check `JCacheMetrics` in the micrometer project. If there is something missing in there, please open an issue in their tracker. 

issue: But I also don't get meters using the JCache, ehcache, hazelcast, ...

issue: Hi... Can someone please help me on how to write a JPA query which checks if a date lies in last 10 days..... `@Query(value = "SELECT r FROM Request r WHERE r.deleted = 0 and r.createdOn > DATE(DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL :days DAY)) ORDER BY r.id ASC")`didn't work.! Gives me parsing error.

issue: Hi All, can some please help on creating microservice without using database, I am storing in file but the issue i am facing is, on every request the data is getting overridden but I want to append to the file 
solution: 

issue: @Servicepublic class MyServiceImpl implements MyService { private File file = new File("output.csv"); @Override public void saveTransaction(MyPojo pojo) {  try (CSVWriter writer = new CSVWriter(new FileWriter(file))) {   BigDecimal amt = pojo.getAmount();   LocalDateTime date = pojo.getTimestamp();   String[] str = { String.valueOf(amt), String.valueOf(date) };   System.out.println(str);   writer.writeNext(str);  } catch (IOException e) {   e.printStackTrace();  } } @ankeshKapil above is my service code 
solution: 

issue: @andihoxha probably yes, just try and ask here 
solution: 

issue: @mmoayyed not yet; the release process should start in the afternoon (EDT) 
solution: 

issue: I don't think the actuator gets initialized before the processManage.theQueue(); so it never loads.  That's my guess. 
solution: 

issue: So actuator was never getting hit.  I made processmanager implement Application runner and kicked off the application in it's run method.  now I have my health enpoints. yaya 
solution: 

issue: if I'm not mistaken you can extend this class `AbstractHealthIndicator` and do whatever you need @chsi13 
solution: 

issue: @mdeinum Interesting … does this apply to kotlin as well? I think I have 2.0.5 running in an `openjdk:11` container here 
solution: 

issue: When I `spring-boot:run` my app, I get an error if the URL contains `{` or `}`. I read on SO many answers on how to set `relaxedQueryChars` property in a Spring `@Configuration`, but I wonder if that can be done via command line (or Maven) too. 
solution: 

issue: i am using Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_181-b13) 2.0.3 running 
solution: 

issue: yes i wrote it into application.properties file, but the error message is the same by the way @marcosbarbero i didn't delete ```       <dependency>            <groupId>mysql</groupId>            <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>        </dependency>``` should i delete these lines ? because i had taken from https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-jpa/ 
solution: 

issue: @enzobonggio  I tried DevimalFormat ,it does not work 
solution: 

issue: If i'm not mistaken I did it once using `SpringBootCondition` @edeandrea 
solution: @marcosbarbero How would that work? Where would I put that? I’m not trying to build an auto-configuration where I’m injecting a bean based on property values (i.e. `@ConditionalOnProperty`). I want to look in the `Environment` for a property. Based on its presence or its value being a certain value I want to set a different property to a certain value. 

issue: now i'm confused, first you said:>I’m building a set of libraries on top of Spring Boot, packaged as Spring Boot Starters.and then you said:>I’m not trying to build an auto-configurationNow I'm not sure what you are actually trying to build 
solution: 

issue: Well, I can be misunderstanding things here but I don't see how it's not an `*AutoConfiguration` once you want to conditionally set properties based on another property 
solution: 

issue:  ```@GetMappingfun getIdentities(payload: IdentitySearchRequest, pageable: Pageable) =        service.searchProcess(payload, pageable)```I'm trying to map the query string of the request to this class. But it doesn't work. Any idea? (its kotlin) 
solution: 

issue: it doesn`t work :( 
solution: 

issue: nevermind, it seems it was an error in a subclass that was causing a jackson exception to be thrown first I think that works. Thanks @edeandrea  and @ofabricio 
solution: yeah be careful when your `ResponseEntity` is the exception itself. I usually use `@JsonIgnoreProperties({ "stackTrace", "suppressedExceptions", "cause" })`. 

issue: I How return multipart mixed response with GetMapping request? Do I have To use jersey types ? Want To return 2 parts, one in json and one file. 
solution: 

issue: Hello, just found for multipart --> HttpEntity<MultiValueMap> with part as values. But when http error happened (example for 404 or 500) default handler tries to convert to JSON --> 406 not acceptable error. What I have to do ? Write an exceptionhandler that map exceptions to Multipart responses ? 
solution: 

issue: and it's not really content-negotiation because json is only for errors.. So set both mediatypes in produces don't work 
solution: 

issue: Hello everyone I was just wondering if there is some way I might be able to make it so I don't need to do a find, and check if null before calling save? Like if I could just have save update the record if it's found, or insert if not? 
solution: 

issue: Hi everyone! I'm looking for a good pattern for handling exceptions that can't be handled by a controller advice class with exception handlers. How do you control the error responses that result from 404s or other exceptions that might not be thrown from the Controller layer? 
solution: 

issue: @makefriend8  why do you start variable names with uppercase letters? This is uncommon (or a bad practice) within Java and JSON => Start with lowercase letter and use camel case.

issue: I think there is a bug in the 2.0.5 boot framework parent, spring itself appears to have no conflict. gonna try to lower that 
solution: 

issue: I see the problem I think 
solution: 

issue: I've been banging my head against the wall for few weeks now trying to fix this issue, but I can't figure out why this exception EntityNotFoundException is thrown.The exception is ofc correct, I don't understand why it does not return null as usual.```public class SomeObject {  @Id  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)  private Long id;}``` 
solution: 

issue: @hayaticakici Hi, no it is not HQL query. Sorry, i tried to simplify the case, but I actually have a little more complex query that is not covered by `findById` method:`@Query("select someObject from SomeObject someObject where someObject.id = ?1, someObject.someField = ?2")`but it does fail for both queries 
solution: 

issue: @BrianDeacon yes, that's right; if you create both, the issue will be closed as a duplicate. 
solution: 

issue: @ShehryarShoukat96 No. Kafka does not support STOMP at all. 
solution: 

issue: If you google around you’ll find for lots of technology frameworks/libraries/tools (Angular, Apigee, etc) that there isn’t support for it even though the spec does not explicitly forbid it. 
solution: 

issue: Hello After lot of time passed on this issue, I understood by reading this https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.0-Migration-Guide that Oauth2 is going to be implemented in spring security core

solution: 

issue: I’m actually a big fan of spring rest docs and using something else was never a requirement for me, sorry :/ oops, sorry for the  misinformation @springroll12 
solution: 

issue: Catch the exception in your endpoint and return a 400 response in your catch althogether with the message you want 
solution: 

issue: @PaulienVa thank you a lot! 
solution: 

issue: @PaulienVa I am not sure what you mean by “solved yet”. The warning is there to indicate that you have multiple org.json implementation on the classpath that could include an API variants and an issue at runtime The starter brings `jsonassert` that uses a json library. Vaadin uses a different implementation. To fix the warning, exclude `org.skyscreamer:jsonassert` from the test starter 
solution: 

issue: @davidkarlsen no need to ping Phil, really. It’s flagged for `2.1.x` so it’s our intention to merge it 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll don’t you think it is weard that org:skyscreamer uses a vaadin dependency ? ``` 
solution: 

issue: No I'm not. This is something new I'm trying to do. 
solution: enable actuator endpoints and fit them into our security model essentially.. 

issue: Oh you were not :) I was just trying to understand the reason why you want to do this. I still haven’t :) (IMO that’s not clearer) Using `@PreAuthorize` on features you don’t own is not a very scalable model IMO Neither of that happens with Actuator security. If you decide to use `@PreAuthorize` you don’t really have a choice of combining that with securing code you don’t own. Trying to extend code you don’t own so that it fits with your preferred approach doesn’t sound like a good idea to me. But I guess there’s not much else to be said on this topic now. What Eric said 
solution: 

issue: I agree, but I would also argue that combining `@PreAuthorize` with global configuration is messy. I would also argue that path matching all your endpoints in a single long chain call in securityConfig is not optimal. but I guess that is the only way to unify all the security config What I mean is that if I use `@PreAuthorize` for securing code I do own, and using the global config for endpoints that are owned by other projects is messy. I'm not suggesting extending actuator endpoints anymore, just that since method security is not available, it would make sense to convert my existing `@PreAuthorize` usage to the global config. 
solution: 

issue: How else would you do it? As @snicoll mentions you can’t annotate methods on code you do not own

solution: 

issue: Bummer. AWS codebuild only suppprts up to java 9. All that work for nothing 
solution: 

issue: Yep, get the `Environment` and ask for the property What tutorial is that? 
solution: 

issue: Yes, disable with `spring.devtools.restart.log-condition-evaluation-delta=false` 
solution: 

issue: i was sure you would ask for that... as usual its not that easy to strip down all the project to a simple reproducable sample. but i will try. but why there is no spring-boot evaluation report when using devtools and debug=true? 
solution: 

issue: @jagjeevanjohal That's my opinion too. Sadly I am not the one to decide on it in this situation, so I need to work around. Any idea? 
solution: 

issue: if you run devtools in docker and make the override change suggested to make it work, will this also disable the "auto disabling in production" feature? For some reason I can't find the override you need to make at the moment, but I remember reading it somewhere 
solution: 

issue: @abhishekransing_twitter That's what I mean. If you run in docker, the docker container will likely run 'java -jar'. and there is a workaround to enable devtools for that scenario but I imagine it also disables the "auto disable in production" functionality I guess to clarify I should say that I do all my development in docker

issue: @nkmurthy edit that, go into compose mode (right side of input bar) and add "```" at the top and bottom of the error please. 
solution: @nkmurthy which DB are you using? spring uses hibernate as default. if you want to use different vendor then you need to customize it. 

issue: @springroll12 we don’t discuss spring-cloud related questions, there is #spring-cloud for that @nkmurthy that looks like a corrupted classpath to me. Can you jump from 1.2 to the latest 1.5 first. And only then migrate to 2.0 once you’re done?

solution: 

issue: I tracked it because I think it is the issue somebody else can experience as well and they will be able to find it.. they wouldn't be able to find it in gitter 
solution: 

issue: I'd argue this is not some random question, I have a sample showing the problem the thing is I'm not sure whether it's Boot problem or some other problem with Spring Data or something else.. it's not obvious 
solution: 

issue: got your point.. there is a chance it is a Boot issue though :) 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll my requirement is just want to add in log ,method processing duration and request url if required. etc( only in the rest controller) . But micrometre will give full statistics that is not required and more ever need to Prometheus dependency along with actuator. @snicoll it's metrics collector 
solution: 

issue: It doesn’t need prometeheus What makes you think that? I know what it is. It’s not mandatory If you don’t want to rely on metrics, you can have some inspiration looking at `WebMvcMetricsFilter` but that’s more work on your end

issue: Hi everybody, I'm playing around with spring boot + webflux right now and trying to understand how some things work behind the scenes. So I have this simple controller endpoint that's basically just a sysout of numbers 0 to 4 every seconds using an interval Flux, and at the end, returning a simple string. It works, but I noticed that when my client disconnects in the middle of it, the "operation" doesn't fully complete (as in I don't get a sysout of numbers 0 to 4, it stops in the middle where my client quits). What if I want this operation to fully complete if my client disconnects though? 
solution: 

issue: hello spring boot team; is it advisable to use `reactor-http-nio-X`  threads for internal processing? E.g. all the I/O etc? I believe these threads are reactor-netty threads and should be used to receive incoming requests; not the internal processing. 
solution: 

issue: @nnanda2016 In a Spring WebFlux + Reactor Netty app, everything is done by default on those threads, unless you `publishOn`/`subscribeOn` manually. So: yes. Once you've scheduled work on a different Scheduler, I don't think we offer the possibility to schedule work back on those. 
solution: 

issue: i may be doing some blocking (e.g. JDBC) I/O tasks…so these threads will be blocked. my question was related to some reccommendation from boot team on these resource management

solution: 

issue: @bclozel Thank you for your answer, and sorry for the quite late reply. I understand that the behaviour is compliant and expected from a reactive component and I do agree that it is useful (I understand how it works behind the scenes, related to the reactive streams spec). However, to me, the behaviour I'm looking to achieve is not an uncommon one, and I haven't been able to find documentation or suggestions about this sort of thing (well, not easily). But solution you're proposing does make a lot of sense though, and is idiomatic to this execution model. I will try that, thank you for your suggestion.

solution: i already tried all the flags of the universe :(. the only diff error i get is:> Caused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCurrentlyInCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'scopedTarget.dataSource': Requested bean is currently in creation: Is there an unresolvable circular reference?. 

issue: tried putting it in the test class ```Caused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'client' defined in com.potrero.g2r.phdb.EMRRepoTest$ApolloConfig: Unexpected exception during bean creation; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Could not resolve placeholder 'local.server.port' in value "${local.server.port}"``` 
solution: An EnumConstantNotPresentException is thrown when something tries to reference an enum constant by name when it doesn’t exist. The Proxy variant of it is thrown, in my experience, when there’s reflection involved. If you debug your app with a breaking point on the EnumConstantNotPresentExceptionProxy(Class<? extends Enum<?>>, String) constructor, you should see the class of the enum and name of the non-existent constant.

issue: If subscategory is the right Name, i am Not sure. You can solve this also with only /category/{entryID} 
solution: 

issue: /category/{entryID} returns all categories only but not sub catgories sadly sub category is in a separate table doens’t make sense why they want this since they’ve implemented a tag feature in it too -_- 
solution: 

issue: Does anyone knows how to register validator for requestbody? I tried with InitBinder with name as my RequestBody class in camelCase, but it's not working 
solution: 

issue: Well, I configured it. But now I fell into issue that ConstraintValidators not working at all with WebMvcTest 
solution: 

issue: `Error activating Bean Validation integration` probably means you don't have any bean validator implementation on the classpath. 
solution: 

issue: can anyone tell me where `local.server.port` is created? need to try to figure this https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/14877 out, nvm, found it `ServerPortInfoApplicationContextInitializer` don't see why that should work generally though... 
solution: 

issue: @duke-cliff This issue is fixed. Are you using a Spring Framework version containing the fix? 
solution: 

issue: I just updated to 2.0.6 I am working on a legacy project with a weird gradle setup. Is there some particular dependency I need to worry about? 
solution: 

issue: Just checked the dependencies, all springframework should be on 5.0.10/5.0.8 
solution: 

issue: Then it might not be the same issue - do you have a project we can take a look at? 
solution: Only thing is the project is using DeferredResult<ResponseEntity<...>> as the endpoint response and I am using webflux not webmvc. Could that be the reason?. @bclozel Get it! Thanks.  I am just in the middle of converting our server common library from rxjava+webmvc implementation into webflux.  Thanks.

solution: 

issue: Can anyone please answer my question 
solution: 

issue: @ssnarvariya No, there isn't. The Weblogic Liberty team is trying something different (https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/was_beta_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/rwlp_springboot.html) - the Spring Boot team does not particularly endorses this deployment mode.

solution: 

issue: Hi all. I'm working on upgrading a [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) (Spring+Angular) application and have [this](https://gist.github.com/dancancro/31fef6ecdb845757a7b294c4e6cb4da9) error: `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.elasticsearch.common.settings.Settings.settingsBuilder()`. My pom.xml looks like [this](https://gist.github.com/dancancro/301a32b33f0122d058696964d8a9a4dd). I'm not a Spring expert at all.  Would someone mind taking a look at it? 
solution: 

issue: Does the Spring Boot community have any best practices around handling graceful shutdown in Kubernetes environments (e.g., when SIGTERM has been received to immediately take action to have the liveness probe fail so new requests are not sent to the app)? I found some commentary and advice on the web. 
solution: 

issue: I am using the version of spring integration that is brought in automatically by the spring boot starter.  I was able to get it to work by turning off JMX inside spring boot.  Not sure why it fails silently in that case but I am looking into it since i need to turn jmx back on for other reasons 
solution: 

issue: @CHANDRAKANTHREDDY93 I don't see any error here. What does your pom look like? @CHANDRAKANTHREDDY93 Maven most likely has a corrupted dependency which makes it appear as if it is not on the classpath. Try clearing out Maven's cache and building your application again.

issue: Hi, I've got a question. We've got an endpoint for a POST call, that has an optional request parameter and a request body. When calling the endpoint without the request parameter it works, but when adding the parameter to the request we get an HttpMediaTypeNotAcceptableException As far as I can tell, this should be possible, but I am looking for the right way to configure this ```@PostMapping("/productlabels", produces = ["application/pdf"], consumes = ["application/json"])fun productlabels(@RequestParam(required = false, defaultValue = "AVERY_J8159") format: String, @RequestBody labelsToPrint: ProductLabelSpecification)``` Any ideas? If I recall correctly, this is supposed to work. I am on Spring Boot 2 btw

solution: 

issue: In my gradle powered Spring Boot project I have 2 java sources: main and performance-testI wanted to make beans from performance-test be available in main, so I made following gradle change:```sourceSets { performanceTest {  java {   compileClasspath += main.compileClasspath   srcDir file('src/performance-test/java')  }  resources.srcDir file('src/performance-test/resources') } main {  java {   compileClasspath += performanceTest.output + performanceTest.compileClasspath   runtimeClasspath += performanceTest.output + performanceTest.runtimeClasspath  } }}```When I try to deploy the server, it cannot find a bean that is inside performance-test source, and as soon as I move it to main, it resolves just fine.I print the classpath and I can see `.class` file for that bean there [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/UB8e/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/UB8e/image.png) Am I missing something?

issue: @venkatasreekanth I have a gradle plugin that increments based on git tag... not really an auto increment though, if you're doing semver, auto-incrementing would mean you'd have to describe what kind of release I say increments, but really it just uses the git tag... 
solution: 

issue: either way... I'd say what you're really looking for is a build tool plugin, afaik Spring Boot doesn't provide one 
solution: 

issue: not sure…this was about 7 or 8 years ago…even where i work now it was a long process i had to go through to get approval 
solution: 

issue: @DoraRajappan That shouldn't be necessary. The error suggests that everything's in place on the server side to support file uploads. The problem appears to be that the client (Angular in this case) hasn't sent a properly formed multipart request.

solution: 

issue: @chad_d_stud_twitter No, Spring Data JDBC is a new module in Spring Data Lovelace. Support for it is new in Boot 2.1. 
solution: 

issue: It doesn’t have an `@since` in the javadoc so I would assume boot 1.0? the `excludeName` attribute was added in `1.3.0` `@SpringBootApplication` came in boot `1.2.0` and i believe `@EnableAutoConfiguration` existed before that 
solution: 

issue: You are correct, @edeandrea. `@EnableAutoConfiguration` has been there since the very beginning. It was part of the first milestone, 0.5.0.M1: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/v0.5.0.M1/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/EnableAutoConfiguration.java

issue: Hello guysIm developing an reactive-app with spring webflux and using redis as database. I want continuously querying all data in my collection just like MongoDb with @Tailable annotation. Is there a way to do it in redis too? 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll thank you. Can you point me to these callbacks? 
solution: you inject the two in a bean and a `@PostConstruct`. You’re using that right?. 

issue: Sorry.. mssql-jdbc 6.4.0 is the version of the dependency in spring boot 2.1.0. I found a issue in the mssql project that might be related to my problems. Indicating a collation-bug in the driver that was fixed in 6.4.2 
solution: 

issue: ```@GetMapping(path = "/stream-flux", produces = MediaType.TEXT_EVENT_STREAM_VALUE)public Flux<String> streamFlux() {    return Flux.interval(Duration.ofSeconds(1))      .map(sequence -> "Flux - " + LocalTime.now().toString());}```I wonder if a event stream like that will consume a lot of resources as it needs to keep a connection open with the clients? 
solution: 

issue: @janfrodeh_twitter IIRC, I didn't upgrade to 7.0 of the driver as it would have been a new major version in a new minor of Boot 
solution: 

issue: Yes. sure. I was thinking about contacting to someone from Hibernate ORM team, and list down the Exceptions. 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona Okay. Thanks :) Will start working in that direction. 
solution: FWIW, I don't think the exception in #1573 is suitable for failure analysis. `HibernateException` is very broad and to be more precise with it we'd have to get into matching on the exception message which I don't like doing. There may be other bootstrapping failures where Hibernate throws something more specific.. 

issue: Hi, anyone having problems to load JSP resources from WEB-INF after upgrading to Spring Boot 2.1? I use the typical configuration with "spring.mvc.view.prefix=/WEB-INF/view/" and "spring.mvc.view.suffix=.jsp"; after the upgrade I'm getting warnings for "Path with "WEB-INF" or "META-INF" and 404 resource not found error. 
solution: 

issue: hello Spring Boot team, for custom exception handling, i am providing a bean of type `ErrorAttributes` as per the document (https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-developing-web-applications.html#boot-features-webflux-error-handling). How does it determine what’s the HTTP status? My app uses a custom Runtime exception? Do I need to extend `ResponseStatusException`? Or I just need to provide this in the error attributes map? `errorAttributes.put("status", errorStatus.value());`? 
solution: 

issue: in my case, we have a single exception which is used with various error codes and status is decided from the error code we have just too many error scenarios and each scenario does not have it’s own exception so, to say, status is dynamic 
solution: 

issue: is it being set to 0 when you use `@ResponseStatus` instead of your `AbstractErrorWebExceptionHandler`? It is likely an issue of where you positioned your custom filter in the filter chain 
solution: also, the status was not correctly populated…i have to make changes in the filter to populate it correctly. i want a valid value (basically the value should be as the JSON error message i am sending back). 

issue: StackOverflowError at java.io.UnixFileSystem.delete0 My springboot run after 1hour , show it; 
solution: 

issue: I am trying to fix an app to not fail if the redis cache is down. I have a @Configuration extending CachingConfigurerSupport overriding CacheErrorHandler errorHandler() with an CacheErrorHandler that just logs the errors. However, if I shut down redis the RedisConnectionFailureException exceptions are still thrown. It does not look like the error handler is called at all. Spring Boot 2.1.0... Any ideas? 
solution: 

issue: do you really need to parallelize to make saving of a list of objects faster? Possibly check out https://frightanic.com/software-development/jpa-batch-inserts/ Haven't tried the technique above in the article, as I haven't used JPA for a long time and can't recall, but in general batching of writes should be considered as opposed to threaded writes, you would have to compare yourself what is faster. Many databases also have some bulk insert/update interfaces for really fast insert/update of many records at once but that's maybe hard to access when using some OR-mapper and JPA... but sharing a JPA session across threads sounds like it could lead to trouble

Just found that bug in jira after a few hours trying to understand the calltraces :D 
solution: 

issue: What’s the stacktrace? Not sure that the error handler is a sane route Are you using `sync=true`? There you go then Starting with “it works if I remove sync=true” would have been enough :)

solution: 

issue: @zoumhane your method doesn't make much sense, cause you saying `getAllStepName` but you return a boolean @zoumhane also you have a few typos in `stepRepo.findByOrdreAndProjetIdEquals` (btw you dont need the "Equals") @zoumhane anyway, i'd go like this: ```@GetMapping("/stepName/{idStep}/{idProject}")public Boolean getAllStepName(@PathVariable("idStep") Integer idStep, @PathVariable("idProject") Integer idProject) {    return stepRepo.existsByOrderAndProjectId(idStep, idProject);}``` 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll yeah, that is from shedlock example. This project im doing maintenance wasn't made by me so im a bit afraid of changing things 
solution: It’s a bean name. And it looks wrong to me. No need to pray, really. You can search in the codebase if that name is hardcoded and adapt accordingly. 

issue: its not, internal usage only i guess 
solution: is this deprecated?. 

issue: @errazki1995 I am afraid not. This channel is for Spring Boot questions only. Please ask on StackOverflow 
solution: 

issue: Try cleaning your ~/.m2 directory and running it again. ? 
solution:

solution: But what does it return. so just ```    @Bean    public RoleRepositoryImpl roles() {        return new RoleRepositoryImpl();    }```. 

issue: can you do the action mark the first one as primary  and try again ? if the problem persists then it's a bit weird having 2 beans and not recognizing any one it turns out it's not the problem tho , just undo that solution did you add the bean in xml as well ? 
solution: 

issue: Hi all, I asked something in the wrong place, in a GitHub issue, and @snicoll sent me ask here :) I’m part of the Infinispan core developers, and I’m working now on the infinispan-spring-boot starter. I’m working on the integration of the actuator metrics. I’ve realised working on that about the actuator metrics not being tracked for caches that are not present (or configured) in the startup. I’ve been testing the spring-boot cache example. Caffeine seems to work if I modify the configuration and add the ```spring.cache.cache-names=countries``` in the application. propeties. However, hazelcast metrics don’t seem to work (maybe I’m doing something wrong) even if the cache is supposed to be configured in the hazelcast.xml and statistics are enabled. I would expect this to work. Infinispan does not work but I know it’s not explicitly supported right now (something I’m doing at least in our starter) 
solution: 

issue: I would expect in the example, to ```spring.cache.jcache.config=classpath:infinispan.xml ``` to work too 
solution: 

issue: the xml is not mandatory 
solution: I would expect this to be the regular use case.. and I tried calling the ```bindCacheToRegistry``` and works perfectly (for users that would need to create a cache on the fly and bind stats). 

issue: Brian @bclozel it claims that the constrictor does not exist 
solution: @snicoll I will, my PR is almost meargeable, so I’m pinging back just after, thank you !! :). @karesti so the backstory for 5.2 is that we want to introduce an event that would be fired whenever a cache is created on the fly. Then Spring Boot could have a listener for that and call `bindCacheToRegistry` for you. If the `InfinispanCacheManager` is updated to honour that new contract, that would remove everything we’ve discussed. 

issue: @snicoll yep, I’ve been reading the issue and voted for it haha 
solution: This ? https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-17350. or request or whatever wording you use haha ok, cool. Well, TBH, I do still merge english and french sometimes when writing or speaking haha. 

issue: It’s a change in Spring Framework 5.1. Such nested class are not detected anymore unless flagged explicitly (kind of a weird use case, this should be a `@Configuration` that contributes the controller) An `@Import` on the controller should work I guess

Not sure how that’s related to Spring Boot. But JMS isn’t  a good candidate atm for sure Why wouldn’t you want to embed the broker in your application? That’s really not recommended at all for production

issue: im trying to convert a spring boot project from java 1.8 to 11, but i get this error:> Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/xml/bind/annotation/XmlTypeAny idea? 
solution: 

issue: @ofabricio There's some advice on the wiki about using Java 9+: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-with-Java-9-and-above 
solution: 

issue: Spring Boot has special support for converting to `java.time.Duration` and `org.springframework.util.unit.DataSize` when reading `application.properties`.Does the same work for `java.time.Period`? 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona Are there any plans/discussions to support this? Shall I open an issue for this? 
solution: 

issue: Oh, okay. `P6M` is not as pretty as `6m`, but will work, too. Thanks for the tip. 
solution: 

issue: ```{    "timestamp": "2018-11-13T00:28:52.385+0000",    "message": "could not prepare statement; SQL [select employee0_.id as id1_0_, employee0_.first_name as first_na2_0_, employee0_.last_name as last_nam3_0_, employee0_.ssn as ssn4_0_ from employee employee0_]; nested exception is org.hibernate.exception.SQLGrammarException: could not prepare statement",    "details": "uri=/employees"}``` i have created rds instance of postgres and used it as part of the application.properties can someone throw light on this

issue: Hi everyone, I am having a REST Get mapping to return me a pdf file from within the project. Now, the issue I am facing is that upon packaging the pdf file I have gets corrupted somehow (if I try to open it, the text is no longer present ---also the file increases in size). I believe this is due to compression -- is there any way to turn off compression for some files, or for everything altogether? I could not find anything on the documentation or on a quick search

issue: i'm occasionally seeing comments not to use ```@Value```. What should we use instead? i can't remember where i saw it but sometimes i come across it 
solution: 

issue: @zoumhanehello everyone i'm trying to use both h2 database and spring security/ jwt but i can't access to my DB   http://localhost:8080/h2any help plz 
solution: 

issue: It’s null because the source have no description I guess There is no way to contribute that at the moment using code generation 
solution: 

issue: Config server has no idea if it’s custom or not 
solution: 

issue: What I meant to say it doesn’t matter if it’s custom or not So the way you phrased the question doesn’t make much sense I think (if I understood it) 
solution: 

issue: Sorry to spam again, but could someone in the spring-hateoas project have a look at this Q? JacksonTester is not being configured for HAL in a @SpringBootTest I've asked a Q over on SO could someone with spring-hateoas take a look when possible please? Thanks [<-LINK->]
solution: The auto-configured `JacksonTester` will use the context’s `ObjectMapper` which won’t have any of the Spring HATEOAS stuff configured on it. You might be better creating a `JacksonTester` yourself and passing it an appropriately configured `ObjectMapper` to use. I believe Spring HATEOAS has a module that it applies to the `ObjectMapper` to configure it. If you get stuck with that, asking in spring-projects/spring-data is probably your best bet as Spring HATEOAS is maintained by the Data team due to it being used by Spring Data REST.

issue: i guess i've been using postman for so long i don't know how to make it work on a browser xD 
solution: 

issue: @yasserhussain1110 can you post error 
solution: 

issue: @mowol like a Controller method? or something else? At the WebFilter level,  before calling the chain, you don't know where the exchange is going to be mapped to. Maybe not - again, it depends on the actual use case; is it security? Or something like CORS? 
solution: 

issue: I'm researching whether Spring Boot jar deployment supports serving up resources from the BOOT-INF/classes/META-INF/resources folder. I haven't been able to get it working locally using Tomcat as the embedded container. I don't see the code in AbstractEmbeddedServletContainerFactory.java supporting this. 
solution: 

issue: oh oke srry then im leaving seeyas 
solution: 

issue: Can I somehow set the `Content-Type` of `ResponseEntity<VndErrors>` to `application/vnd.error+json` on a global level? 
solution: 

issue: Hi all.. given my application based on spring boot throws e.g. `JsonMappingException`, it knows it should wrap it into `HttpMessageNotReadableException` and this is then returned as `400 Bad request`.. where is this behavior captured in code? 
solution: 

issue: Got it…thanks... just verified; it’s working. is it a candidate for a mention in document? :) 
solution: 

issue: Hm … could be, that the `spring-boot-starter-hateoas` introduces the problem :-S OK, simply using `implementation("org.springframework.hateoas:spring-hateoas")` seems to fix it 
solution: 

issue: @mplanchant this sounds a lot like custom media types; we're doing this for start.spring.io 
solution: 

issue: @Afsoon why are you importing spring cloud sleuth as a BOM? It's not a BOM. 
solution: 

issue: Thank you, I am going to try it 
solution: @wilkinsona it was about (Bouncy Castle) class loading indeed; Once I made sure that necessary classes are loaded on startup the issue with first request slowdown was gone; Or, rather, expressed through longer startup time :). 

issue: An elaborated Spring Boot with Scala demo: https://github.com/sadhen/spring-booted-scala Still work in progress 
solution: 

issue: Hi There, may be it's not the right place for this question but I push my chance. Supports @Cacheable annotation right now Flux and Mono ? Or is there any roadmap for this? 
solution: 

issue: You’re claiming something works with 2.0.x but not with 2.1.x. I am not aware of any such dependency change in Spring Boot so I am trying to see where the change could come from. As I said, this is wild unproductive guess. 
solution: with that simple build.gradle file. a hello world service isn't working. 

issue: okay i found the issue. some of the classes were still referencing java servlets WITHOUT throwing a compiler error in eclipse 
solution: 

issue: i wish i could've given you more info but from my end i wsan't getting any info either :-/ just some cryptic red marker telling my a *class* was looking for a servlet i tried closing the project and restarting eclipse but it didn't fix the issue either. it was only after removing those unneeded classes when it started working again 
solution: 

issue: When service is Down actuator should return "Down " message but I am not getting any thing 
solution: 

issue: Remember, if the app itself is down the actuator endpoint is also down and will not be able to report anything... Only dependency healthchecks like the database, diskspace etc will be reported down 
solution: 

issue: Hi! I have a small question: is there any way to register a "Caffeine Cache" in Spring Actuator? There are more details here: [<-LINK->]
solution: Use CacheManager, but `CacheManager` only has methods to get caches, no? I cannot register a new one. Add your custom cache into CacheManager, inject CacheManager and get that cache out for your usage [<-LINK->].

issue: @DoraRajappan On the face of it, that looks like a problem with your query method. That could either be because your method name doesn't match the properties of the entity, or that you've defined a custom `@Query` annotation and it doesn't match the entity. I can't tell which of those it might be as you haven't provided enough information. I think you'd probably be best asking in the spring-projects/spring-data channel and providing some more information about all the pieces that are involved. I'm struggling to see any connection between the two. Can you share a minimal example that behaves as you've described? 
solution: 

issue: Any help would greatly be appreciated, I am a bit in the dark it seems 
solution: 

issue: @AndrewZurn I can't think why that would be happening. It sounds like a Spring Framework bug if it is. Can you share a minimal example that reproduces the behaviour? 
solution: 

issue: @bclozel thanks a lot, and I guessed it was just me 
solution: 

issue: i want find a friend  with study the coding,i from china,if u want,you will have a china friend,thank u so much! 
solution: 

issue: @kibbled the `it `is the serverResponse and its respponseBody is always null... so I can’t check the message send back from the handler... 
solution: > You're passing the system property into the JVM that's running Maven and that JVM isn't always the one that runs your app as a new JVM may be forked. You should use `mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.jvmArguments="-Dserver.port=9990"` instead. I'd recommend always doing that, irrespective of the use of DevTools, so that you're not relying on the forking behaviour.@wilkinsona I tried with ` -Dspring-boot.jvmArguments="-Dserver.port=9990"` but Tomcat still binds to 8080 with DevTools.. 

issue: I'm new here and having some issues getting materialize running fully. Im trying to run the date picker, from here: [<-LINK->]. An error occurs on this line: "var instances = M.Datepicker.init(elems, options); " which is in the domcontentloaded event. I believe this is because "options" is not defined at this point. I don't know what options should be defined as, and am running the js import on the line before. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Any help is appreciated!
solution: You have to provide the options by yourself like `M.Datepicker.init(elems, {autoClose:true}); ` for example.

issue: BTW, do you think I should open an issue about that ? 
solution: 

issue: Hey! I am having a problem with spring auto configuration I have provided SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=SPRING_DATASOURCE_USER =SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=SPRING_DATASOURCE_DIRVER-CLASS-NAME= these environment varialbles but spring boot does not create datasource object and complains required a bean of type 'javax.sql.DataSource' that could not be found. - Bean method 'dataSource' not loaded because @ConditionalOnProperty (spring.datasource.jndi-name) did not find property 'jndi-name' - Bean method 'dataSource' not loaded because @ConditionalOnBean (types: org.springframework.boot.jta.XADataSourceWrapper; SearchStrategy: all) did not find any beans any ideas ? 
solution: 

issue: that is the auto-configuration report I have pasted is not that ? 
solution: 

issue: yes @corneil il i did that 
solution: 

issue: actually i am using  a jar file concept inside it  i have this annotation configured so i want once i enable that annotationthe component what i have mention above my annotation should scan @wilkinsona @corneil  i tried toobut as mentioned above it makes no difference while removing @Component too 
solution: 

issue: @corneil  no no its not 
solution: 

issue: @kjan a mail server conn failure is just that. it's not going to cause unusual loads. 
solution: 

issue: @craigblackman2 Well, the endpoints are definitely in the wrong context, but I can't tell why. The auto-configuration report might help to figure out why. You can start your app with `--debug` to get it to show that. 
solution: 

issue: I am getting unsatisfied dependency through setConfigurers method in ProxyAsyncConfiguratiin Any idea what this can be? 
solution: 

issue: Hi folks, I am trying to compile the springframework on my machine and deploy it on my local maven. If I run `./gradlew install` it does send all the module to my local mavel. But when I try to compile a project using the version I just generated, it does not recognises the dependencies in the local maven. Am I missing something? 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona this is awesome ```2018-11-26 13:00:05.330  INFO 13992 --- [ctor-http-nio-1] r.ipc.netty.tcp.BlockingNettyContext     : Started HttpServer on /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:80802018-11-26 13:00:05.331  INFO 13992 --- [  restartedMain] o.s.b.web.embedded.netty.NettyWebServer  : Netty started on port(s): 8080```but I can prove it's not, docker for mac has claimed that port with another boot app... not sure if I should open an SB bug, 'cause it's netty that's not... 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona - no problem. Yeah, let me see if I can't get fully working project setup then hosted for you all. I'll try to boil it down to as small of a surface space where the problem can still be observed as possible. 
solution: That'd be great, thank you. As I think I said before, I suspect it's a Spring Framework bug, but having a minimal sample that reproduces the problem will let us route the issue to the right place more quickly.. 

issue: Hey all, apologies if this is the wrong place to ask but does anyone know if it's possible to configure WebFlux to use Gson has the HttpMessageConverter for rest controllers? I've been banging my head against a wall for a while with this.

issue: Hi @marcelosv I'm quite confused with this statement>I 'm doing an integration between a apache project and Spring Boot is it a spring-boot project or not? is it an integration or a migration? hehe I know, but I would advise you not to speak portuguese in the channel, it's kinda global :) yeah, DM me :) 
solution: 

issue: what I basically need a set of examples with pretty explanations some youtube channel would work ok

issue: looks like my problems are not spring boot related 
solution: 

issue: I am having trouble with Spring-Boot autoconfiguring Hazelcast for session replication. The docs (https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.0.6.RELEASE/reference/html/boot-features-session.html) say that just adding the spring-session-hazelcast dependency will autoconfigure session clustering with embedded Hazelcast. It seems to be working except for a serializable error when the session is persisted. Is there a working demo of this somewhere? 
solution: 

issue: Can anyone help me to find a solution for this issue. I didn't get any response in stackoverflow . this is the link for the issue https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53467546/spring-boot-connection-failure-with-rabbitmq-web-stomp-plugin 
solution: 

issue: Hi can anyone help, I've done a website using Materialize for CSS all been good so far but then found that a dropdown list I created using "option" behaved oddly on mobiles e.g the output was not always the value you selected?? (only on phones), I removed the links to Materialize and noted that when its removed A dropdown list turns into native iOS picker on the phone (which I think is better and more reliable) is there anyway of forcing this picker to be used but keeping the Materilize styling ? [<-LINK->] [<-LINK->] or any idea why the dropdown doesn't pick reliably?
solution: There is an issue with iOS right now. Go to this link and follow the first comment [<-LINK->]

issue: @bclozel thank you. It really looks like that it is the same issue. Using `@TestConfiguration` on test controller resolved my issue. 
solution: 

issue: i find OkHttp MockWebServer to be “clunky” in that regard whereas WireMock more closely aligns with `MockRestServiceServer` except it separates the stubs from the verifications, whereas with `MockRestServiceServer` you set up the stubs & expectations in the same step and for verification just call `verify()` just my 2 cents! 
solution: 

issue: @4goodapp If you are just starting out and in a position to choose what to use for your views, I wouldn't recommend using JSPs 
solution: @4goodapp I’d agree with @wilkinsona’s comment. JSP would be the last view I would recommend. Thymeleaf/Freemarker are much better. Thymeleaf is probably the most popular, but I think you'll have a better experience with any of the template engines listed on start.spring.io than if you use JSPs. So pick one of Thymeleaf, FreeMarker, Mustache, or Groovy templates. I'd probably avoid the latter unless you're using Groovy elsewhere.. 

issue: The event is fired immediately after the web server's been started It's starting the web server that initialises its HTTP connector and allows it to start accepting requests 
solution: 

issue: thx, i read yes - when this event is triggered, the rest endpoints are available to be called by clients. 
solution: 

issue: Yeah but they all use Maven and I want to work with Gradle.

issue: Hello, I tried to do a fresh sync and got error indicating that bad block detected. All log is spammed with this message. What can I do to fix it? I'm using Parity 2.1.6-stable and upgraded to 2.1.8-stable 
solution: 

issue: ugh. i was kinda hoping it was something simpler like a flag. i've had some java security related discussions when searching for it but a lot of caveats or a workaround 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll thanks, i search project and found another code from my colleague 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll > The bean 'service.FeignClientSpecification', defined in null, could not be registered. A bean with that name has already been defined in null and overriding is disabled.Action:Consider renaming one of the beans or enabling overriding by setting spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true okay this error is new 
solution: 

issue: There's no need to move them. Just put them in `src/main/webapp`. A war project (Maven or Gradle) will automatically include files in `src/main/webapp` in the root of the packaged war. 
solution: 

issue: Ok thanks. The thing is that then it won't work for the `.jar` packaging if someone decides to fork the app and use that packaging. I was hoping for a solution that would work for both, sorry for not being explicit enough about it 
solution: I wouldn't worry about that until it becomes a problem. If you want to deal with it now, you can move the resources out into `META-INF/resources` of a separate module and depend upon it. The module will then be packaged in `WEB-INF/lib` (war) or `BOOT-INF/lib` (jar). The servlet spec requires that resources be loaded from `META-INF/resources` of dependencies in `WEB-INF/lib`. Boot extends that to cover dependencies in `BOOT-INF/lib` for an executable jar.. 

issue: Exception on startup 
solution: `EndpointMvcAdapter` does not exist in Spring Boot 2.x. You must have something on the classpath that requires Spring Boot 1.x.. 

issue: Hello, When I deploy my springboot application in wildfly 10.0.0, I am getting below warning message in wildfly at startup time. 
solution: 

issue: Can anyone tell me what the difference is between an antmatcher & mvcmatcher (spring httpsecurity) ? When do I use ant/mvc ? 
solution: 

issue: hi. can anybody tell me what I'm doing wrong here: https://github.com/domi55/spring-boot-docker-demo somehow the `docker build` command does not work for me and returns``` 
solution: 

issue: @domi55 Building an application inside a Docker container and then running it is a little unusual. Do you really want Maven and your application's source to be available in the environment where it's running? It's more typical to build the application outside of the container and then add the built binary to the container. With that said, the problem is that your `ADD src ./` results in `src` being stripped off so you have `./main/java` in your container not `./src/main/java`. Changing it to `ADD src ./src` will fix it. @ksgr999 That's a Wildfly bug or limitation. It can't cope with `module-info.class` files for the module system that's available in Java 9 and later. Wildfly 10 is almost 3 years old. Hopefully a more up-to-date version will have fixed the problem. 
solution: 

issue: Has someone noticed a decrease in Performance between Spring Boot 2.0.4 vs 2.0.5+ when running in Docker? Not sure what the actual problem, is but scanning within custom dispatcher servlets has decreased a lot for us. Initialising the servlet went from under 1s to 10 or more seconds. Boot 2.1 is fine

issue: @gitmnd because UTF-8 is the default encoding for JSON, as specified in the RFC 
solution: What is the ideal way to enforce UTF-8 when sending XML payload. I am using            headers.setContentType(MediaType.TEXT_XML);       HttpEntity<String> entity = new HttpEntity<>(content, headers);       restTemplate.postForObject(url, entity, String.class);. 

issue: Hey guys I'm kind of new to Spring Integration and I can't figure out how to actually connect the damn servers to utilize these channels I don't see anywhere to supply a hostname/etc 
solution: 

issue: Aren’t you using the bom? 
solution: Strangley enough I've been using boot for 1-2 years without thinking about that before - probably since we've primarily been using starters.. https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-dependency-management. 

issue:  
solution: Any ideas what to look for if a been is being resolved as `NullBean`? After upgrade to boot 2 `defaultSockJsTaskScheduler` is picked up as a bean for `TaskScheduler` but I don't use sock JS and it fails with `org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanNotOfRequiredTypeException: Bean named 'defaultSockJsTaskScheduler' is expected to be of type 'org.springframework.scheduling.TaskScheduler' but was actually of type 'org.springframework.beans.factory.support.NullBean'`.  I'm trying to step through the spring bean resolution code - but that hole seems pretty deep ;).

solution: What would I have to do to read XML in an object using `@RequestBody` and a custom media type? Currently I end up with `org.springframework.web.server.UnsupportedMediaTypeStatusException: 415 UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE ` My `@PutMapping(consumes = ["myCustom/MediaType"]) fun(@RequestBody foo: Foo)` should load the payload in a class annotated with `@JacksonXmlRootElement`. Isn't that enough for XML content negotiation?. 

issue: @wilkinsona To keep the example short - it does nothing. In the actual application it would be called by AsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler - save error state in DB. Is there a better/other way of storing error state in DB for async error? I did try that, in the case of shutdown the bean is/can be destroyed before it is called so then I would also need to add  DependsOn and now I am back where I started 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona  : thanks for the hint. I am using now SimpleDriverDataSource  for the second database and it seems to work 
solution: 

issue: @kschlesselmann in case your media type ends with `+xml` like @edeandrea said, you won't have to configure anything in Spring since Spring Framework already registers that for XML message converters 
solution: 

issue: Hello everyone, while creating libs is it faster to create a `@Import` vs scanning the package of the lib? I have a lib for every microservice I'm building that has a lot of configuration that all services should have. This lib is currently being loaded via ComponentScan, I'm thinking to switch to a `@Import`if this is faster. 
solution: 

issue: @edeandrea @bclozel That's weird … because my content type looks exactly like that. Maybe it's an issue with webflux? Can I somehow debug the message converters spring tries to resolve? Right now it's `application/vnd.<company>.<service>.<resource>+xml` That explains a lot … Thanks! 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona , thanks,  I will follow your hints, 
solution: 

issue: @edeandrea I'm not sure that answers your question, but this might interest you: https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-16481 
solution: 

issue: Thanks @bclozel I’ve seen that before and understand the implications involved around threading/etc. More specifically to `AuditEvent` I’m just not sure how I would even create an `AuditEvent` object since the `principal` attribute is defined as a `String` and `ReactiveSecurityContextHolder` would return (via some mapping chains) a `Mono<String>`. So I guess my take on this is that for webflux apps there is no support for `AuditEvent`s. I guess I’m looking for confirmation on my assumption :) @bclozel if that is the case should boot’s `AuditAutoConfiguration` only kick in on the servlet stack? 
solution: 

issue: as long as you're not doing blocking work on the event handler, you could publish it in a `doOnNext` operator somewhere in the chain but yes, things are not 100% clear in that space yet and this issue is the best place to track things

solution: 

issue: @tiaanl I don't think I can, the test uses a db service 
solution: 

issue: @psotos It depends how you've configured things If you declare an `AsyncConfigurer` bean and implement `getAsyncExecutor()` to return an `Executor` that's not used anywhere else then it will only be used for `@Async` processing.

solution: 

issue: Could someone provide some places I could start looking for potential issues?  Thanks another data point: if I hit the error controller's mapped endpoint directly, it seems to work fine and it also looks like if I request an non-existent resource in a mapped resource path that I'm sent to the error page appropriately @wilkinsona found it, thanks! It was a web filter gone awry 
solution: 

issue: @cribbstechnologies The root cause is that something is committing the response which limits what can be done in the handling of the error. That something will be calling `ServletResponse.flushBuffer()`

solution: 

issue: @eiselems Sir there are still a lot of changes to be made and I'm not much experienced with SpringBoot. In the process of creating something useful. Let me check the modifications you made. 
solution: A valuable source for me was https://start.spring.io, there you can create your projects from scratch with dependencies you need. Good thing is even if you use other dependencies from spring cloud projects, it is figuring out the correct versions :). 

issue: Yes sir I'm using the Spring initializer but newer dependencies keep coming. That's what makes my pom look irregular. 
solution:

solution: 

issue: Hello Spring boot team, i have a question related to SSL config. My app uses `Spring Boot 2.0.5`, `WebFlux`, `Netty`. - If I set `server.ssl.enabled=true`, but do not provide SSL key-store details (via corresponding properties), what should be the behavior? I mean does server start in SSL mode. I am experiencing a behavior where my app starts without any warning/error, but the requests (over HTTP) fail with `Empty reply from server`. Is this the expected behavior? shouldn’t spring boot complain about missing key-store details if ssl flag is ON? 
solution: 

issue: @nnanda2016 yeah, probably; please file an issue. In the case of reactor netty, we don't support multiple connectors (having both http and https work at the same time), so this is why we end up in that situation. Thanks for finding that out.

issue: While triggering a REST controller in SpringBoot, I'm getting below exception:-{    "timestamp": "2018-12-26T19:00:55.347+0000",    "status": 415,    "error": "Unsupported Media Type",    "message": "Content type 'application/json;charset=UTF-8' not supported",    "path": "/addtheatre"} Have posted it on stack overflow. Got few responses. Tried all of them but to no avail. Need help. @RequestMapping(value="/addtheatre", method= RequestMethod.POST, consumes = { MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE})    public HttpStatus addTheatre(@RequestBody Theatre theatre ) {        theatrerepository.save(theatre);        return HttpStatus.OK;    }  As simple as that. 
solution:

POST requests in other rest controller classes are working fine. Same strategy followed. Trying the same but to no avail. 
solution: 

issue: Okay. Checking from my side. 
solution: ex: removed @Transient   private List<TheatreHall> halls;    @Transient    private Map <Movie,LinkedList<Time>> map;. 

issue: @gitmnd Ohh Great. But we need to dig deep as I can't leave out other properties. Shall I try with @JSONIgnore with the transient fields? 
solution: 

issue: The reason i commented because i dont have source code. In your case,it if throws some error then there is some problem with the association with different bean during SAVE operation. That is why i am suggesting just to ignore/remove properties and see if it works atleast .so that it can give some assurance that the issue is related to this . 
solution: 

issue: customize the jackson mapper used by spring. Add logger category for jackson mapper to see what kind of error message is thrown while parsing the request body and see if there’s a correlation between that error and 415. but all these assuming your code is working as per @gitmnd’s  suggestion 
solution: 

issue: no worries. you can update stackoverflow as well with the exact fault so that any one else might get the same issue. 
solution: 

issue: Yes. Also, will keep posting other questions here as I'm pretty hopeful of my doubts being solved in here. @ddubson Working fine without consumes = { MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE}.  Thanks for the help. 
solution: 

issue: @kdavid76 don’t use the annotation, Spring Session is already auto-configured and there is `spring.session.redis.flush-mode` for that not in bootstrap.yml, no set a system property or something 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll Thanks for the advice. But If I don't use annotation, then I don't see the system connected to Redis during startup. The word "Redis" does not appear in the logs. I tried to start the service with running Redis and turned off instance as well. No difference, it is starting up both ways without the annotation. So, the problem might be with my pom? 
solution: 

issue: @kdavid76 before raising any issue you need to better describe the problem. Nothing to do with gateway for sure. I am not sure it’s not a Spring Boot issue. All I can say from the auto-config report is that it looks like spring session is auto-configured You haven’t really explained why you think it isn’t. Not seeing redis in the logs isn’t the best way to prove that IMO 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll Then can you please what else description is necessary for raising this problem at the correct place with the correct team? Well, Redis is not mentioned in the startup logs, that is sure. But when I make the Redis config wrong, e.g. I use a false port, or false host, then the server also starts up. It does not really tries to connect to Redis, it doesn't use that config. Is this enough proof?

issue: Hi Spring-Booters :), I'll need some insights about this issue raised after upgraded from Spring Boot 2.0 to Spring Boot 2.1.1 : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54080567/spring-boot-2-1-exception-thrown-in-webmvcconfigureraddformatters-not-ca 
solution: 

issue: @edeandrea Not necessarly since all `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler.class` are `protected` so I try to follow the same rule. 
solution: 

issue: Yes I have several  `@RestControllerAdvice` and each one has a `basePackages` The breakpoint is never hit All other cases works perfectly but this one. I didn't had the issue in Java 8/Spring Boot 2.0  but got it with Java 11/Spring Boot 2.1.1 
solution: 

issue: That makes sense. During marshalling and unmarshalling if a field can't be resolved that's what you get. Similar to what a custom converter is doing 
solution: 

issue: My custom exception is totaly ignored, after its throwing  `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler.handleException` is called just after But my exception was thrown first The request flow should stop after my custom exception, am I wrong? I hope it doesn't try to convert the exception ^^ 
solution: 

issue: What I do is I override the underlying protected methods from ResponseEntityExceptionHandler and then check the cause of the exception. Your customer one should be the cause Your custom exception should be the cause of it Which to me actually seems like expected behavior Would be considered a type conversion error I think what's happening is spring is catching your exception and because it's happening during type conversion it's creating a type conversion exception with your custom one as the cause and throwing that. No different than if the payload had a string field that was supposed to be mapped to an int You can't convert a string to an int, so the end result would be the samr That's what I thought 
solution: 

issue: It actually seems somewhat logical to me. You are throwing an exception during type conversion (just like Jackson would be doing if it failed to do type conversion). Spring is handling it consistently Spring doesn't know your exception versus any other library's exception. It does the same thing for input validation I don't know what the change was between boot 2.0 and 2.1 (actually seems like a spring MVC change between 5.1 & 5.2) I really have to sign off for the evening but can continue a conversation about it tomorrow if you'd like Feel free to message me directly if you'd like 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I have created a common jar file to be included in my multiple spring-boot applications. This common jar has class annotated with`ControllerAdvice` for handling exception but when I include the jar in my project other beans (`Services`, `Configurations`, `Component`) get autowired but `ControllerAdvice` doesn't get injected. Even if I use `ComponentScan` to include the `ControllerAdvice` annotation the exceptions are not being caught.

solution: 

issue: @edeandrea maybe, I'll give it a go, don't understand why the kotlin is blowing up.... I moved back to java for the application class and it runs though `BuildProperties` is not available... 
solution: 

issue: https://stackoverflow.com/q/54083990/206466 @edeandrea when I do the java equivalent of what you suggest it says that the `BuildProperties` bean is not available @edeandrea yeah I have that file generated but the bean still isn't available yet, however @snicoll is suggesting I just use the info in MANIFEST.MF in my banner... strangely though this metadata isn't there... it doesn't have to be banner, I'm just trying to get the information *early* 
solution: 

issue: in my `build.gradle` i’ve always just done```groovyapply plugin: 'io.spring.dependency-management’apply plugin: 'org.springframework.boot'apply plugin: 'com.gorylenko.gradle-git-properties'springBoot {  buildInfo()}generateGitProperties {  onlyIf {    !source.isEmpty()  }}```And everything has always just worked 
solution: @snicoll is that info only added on publish do you know?```Calebs-MBP:META-INF calebcushing$ cat MANIFEST.MF Manifest-Version: 1.0Main-Class: org.springframework.boot.loader.JarLauncherStart-Class: com.potrero.Application```. 

issue: just trying to make sure it's before that ;) note: that has your `CommandLineRunner` code in it :/ 
solution: `CommandLineRunner`s run after the application context is successfully refreshed. This error is due to a validation failure of some required properties. In that case a `CommandLineRunner` won’t run. 

issue: a log message asap, that contains what version of the app they're trying to run due bad ops script

solution: 

issue: hello, i think i'm missing a very simple solution, but i just can't figure it out i have a 3rd party library that requires apache.commons.configuration object however, my code is written in spring, so i don't have a configuration object, i only have spring's Environment is there a simple conversion from environment to configuration? i looks a bit stupid to read the same configuration files that spring already parsed as configuration and then feed it to the 3rd party library 
solution: 

issue: as for the original problem of trying to convert properties to apache commons configuration, Spring does not use that library so as @snicoll states if you require that for some other library you are using then you’d have to configure it yourself or build your own adapter that knows how to translate Spring `PropertySource`es (or Spring’s `Environment`) to an apache commons configuration object. need to be able to see the test class along with the auto configuration class to help any further anytime! generally when i run into things like this i’ll create a small empty project and just bring in the bare necessities that are causing the problem…once i get it to work there then figure out how my “real” thing is different from what is working 
solution: 

issue: @timomeinen The system class loader isn't provided by Tomcat but by the JVM. As such, you can't replace it. 
solution: 

issue: You'll either need to change the code that's creating the FileSystem  using one of the overloads that takes a `ClassLoader` (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/FileSystems.html#newFileSystem(java.net.URI,%20java.util.Map,%20java.lang.ClassLoader), for example), or you'll need to package your file system implementation in the root of the Spring Boot fat jar. The latter is fairly easy with Gradle and a bit harder with Maven. 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona Thank you very much for taking time helping me. The problem with the overloaded method which takes a ClassLoader is, that the `FileSystemProvider` is not registered globally by `FileSystemProvider#loadInstalledProviders()` and upcoming calls of e.g. `Paths.get` will not find the provider. The reason is, that `loadInstalledProviders` uses `ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader()` hardcoded.  The `FileSystemProvider` is provided as 3rd party JAR file. I will give the idea of putting it into the root a try.

solution: 

issue: @kevin-madhu this should work. Is it being picked up as a bean? If you've got actuator as a dependency, you should see it listed on the beans endpoint 
solution: 

issue: @edeandrea So following up on that issue I had.  It worked in my example app because I'm using the most recent version of boot.  But for the failing project I'm on 2.0.1 and this is  aknown issue (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/13319).  So I'll be upgrading.

issue: @nightswimmings what do you mean by “starters are not very handy”? 
solution: 

issue: hello.Is there a possible way to configure a `cron job` dynamically ?something like this :```public class DemoExample {    public String parameteredAttributeFunction() {        return "0 0 * * * *" ;          }    @Scheduled(cron = "parameteredAttributeFunction()")    public void demoServiceMethod()    {        System.out.println("Method executed ");    } }```If no, is there an alternative solution ? 
solution: 

issue: looking at `ScheduledAnnotationBeanPostProcessor` it seems there is interpolation that happens on the cron string i’m not sure if its smart enough to evaluate spring expressions if it is, you could provide your own spring bean with a method that could query your database and return the cron String i’m actually curious myself as to whether that would work - i’m going to try it :) 
solution: @snicoll I understand that, yes. All my Components have @EnableScheduling and run() method is @Scheduled with fixedDelayString. I was under the impression that they will run in parallel when the delay expires, independently of each other. Is that not the case?. 

issue: Hi Team, I'm facing an issue with spring boot basic security. Have posted on stack overflow the same.  Can somebody please help me here? The link is :-https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54182436/getting-403-while-accessing-secured-endpoints-in-springboot-even-when-the-roles/54185181#54185181 
solution: 

issue: right by default the thread pool used by the task scheduling configuration is single-threaded, so only one task runs at a time 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll If only we could flag that @Configuration that is meant to be used out of the starter and that that it is not...  I think that is going through that direction: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/4667 
solution: 

issue: Hi All, the kabob case only works for spring boot 2 config?If I use third party lib, whose config is using camelCase, then that should work? 
solution: 

issue: the config yml can be `camelCase`, but while using it within spring boot `@Configuration` classes just use them as `camel-case` this should work e.g. `@Value(${third-party-camel-case})` try that... change kabob case where? in `@Configuration`? i think it wont work at all 
solution: 

issue: Oh, so I need to look at the third party code to check if they are using `@Configuration`, if yes, then change then to kabob case? 
solution: 

issue: Well, the exact issue is that there's a data set whose size is part of a given test (~2k elements), it only takes about a second to load the data, but amortized over the few dozen individual tests it adds up.  The tests run very quickly if the data is inserted before the tests are run, but I don't want the data polluting other tests 
solution: 

issue: @davorm_gitlab I mixed up async and scheduling. The first uses `AsyncTaskExecutor` that’s not recommended for production as it creates a new thread per invocation while the latter uses a single thread by default (that’s why tasks were piled up without config). your executor, there is no need for that in 2.1, check the doc I just told you 
solution: 

issue: that’s odd you should wrap them for a start ``` Yeah ok I can see that log it’s not a warning so there is no reason for it  not to work 
solution: 

issue: Why do you think this is not the place to ask questions? You may want to check that the camel version you are using is compatible with Spring Boot 2.1 https://start.spring.io/actuator/info

issue: Hi Team, If I use @Transient for any field in @Entity class, it's value isn't gonna saved in DB. if I make some changes in an instance of this Entity class via setter methods and  retrieve an instance of this class afterwards, the value of the @Transient field for the object will not change right? What is the alternative here to change the @Transient field? Please clarify. 
solution: @RaviShekhawat The transient field will not be stored in the serialized object, but you can still modify it as much as you want as a normal class property.. 

issue: I totally understand, its not a code of mine, I was just wondering whether this particular change was intended 
solution: It’s an internal change of the binder. We’ve harmonized how stuff are processed in 2.0 so I wouldn’t call that an intended change but this looks more consistent to do that with regards to what we do with `.properties`. 

issue: But I am not sure using @Qualifier(JmsListenerConfigUtils.JMS_LISTENER_ENDPOINT_REGISTRY_BEAN_NAME) for my dependency is a good practice or I should expect a single listener endpoint registry 
solution: 

issue: If `--spring.config.location` is provided with a single directory as the value, will that prevent properties on the classpath to be found? (e.g. `application.yml` from `src/main/resources/config/application.yml`? I guess they are, and I should be using `spring.config.additional-location`instead.

issue: [repost from the weekend] i have a method that works fine with a mustache template using `@ModelAttribute`. but when i convert it to return a `DeferredResult`the template no longer gets called and the method returns json instead of the rendered html. is there a correct way to make the two work together ? or a recommended way to use templates with a non-blocking method ? 
solution: 

issue: @nqzero What did you do in the conversion? I believe it should work if your return `DeferredResult<String>` in the same way that you would have returned `String` before switching to `DeferredResult` 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona i was returning `DeferredResult<ResponseEntity<ArrayList<Fortune>>>`. let me revert back to that code (i've since been rendering the templates manually) and see if i can make it work. thanks !edit: that worked ! thanks again :)

issue: Hi, can anyone take a look at my logs here: https://gist.github.com/mikexliu/ab2d08dd458a3407f06cd67f59c56bbesome of the data is redacted (packages, names, etc). issue is the start up time. it should be a lightweight application but it still takes 26 seconds to start up. i'm not sure what else to look for that could cause slow downs; i've profiled the code and could not find anything significant. here are the dependencies: https://gist.github.com/mikexliu/05a45d7feef86c57964d09bea55580e7(i can't show it here but i've also disabled the majority of AutoConfigurations that I didn't find necessary) 
solution: 

issue: @mikexliu are you running that app in a resource-limited environment (like a container with 1 CPU only)? 
solution: 

issue: Hello, in spring boot 2.1.1, I would like to use metrics, however I'm getting this: `No qualifying bean of type 'io.micrometer.core.instrument.MeterRegistry' available`.  I do have micrometer on the classpath via:```<dependency>      <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>      <artifactId>micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>    </dependency>```I'm not sure why it's not autowired 
solution: 

issue: hi @bclozel , no i'm running it in a docker container (osx) with settings: 4GB memory and 4 CPU 
solution: 

issue: @nWidart you need the actuator. Do you have that? @mikexliu can you start this app on your laptop or without Docker? (I guess so). Can you share the startup number? The actuator is the thing that auto-configures micrometer in the first place Micrometer doesn’t auto-configure anything, it doen’t know about Spring Boot anyway Fair but that’s a management feature that is tied in the concept of actuator in spring boot. Not all auto-configurations are shipped by default 11s seems quite a lot yeah. Twice as much means your 4CPUs aren’t really available or something 
solution: @mikexliu that’s not related to Spring Boot completely. The more classes you have the more chance auto-configuration can kick in for things you aren’t using. Loading a lot of classes can lead to poor startup time. 

issue: @snicoll yes. it takes about half the time: `Started Main in 11.413 seconds (JVM running for 12.572)`. still seems quite long but maybe this is the expected time

issue: hello,I am not sure if this quetion belon to here but I need help if some one can help me.I updated spring parent from 1.5.16 to 2.0.5 and I am facing some issue like:"SecurityProperties.ACCESS_OVERRIDE_ORDER" not found.I searched in internet but I couldn't find a solution 
solution: 

issue: @bclozel   thanks for your reply. I just want to simulate a time-consuming operation scenario, in fact, this code  will be replaced by a loop to get information from a cache. 
solution: @nWidart having Spring Boot Actuator on the classpath and using `RestTemplateBuilder` to build `RestTemplate` instances should work. Now you should make sure that you're really getting the bean you're expecting. Also, how are you checking those metrics are there? Are you using the actuator endpoints?. 

issue: @Lang11 if that CacheUtil class is doing I/O (like reading from a redis instance or a cache server), then you should avoid doing that. You'd be blocking. Now I think the timeout operator should still work. Do you have a sample repo I could take a look at? 
solution: 

issue: thank you very much, please wait a moment. I will upload my code to github. 
solution: 

issue: hm so it seems like I can't do this either:```  @Bean  @ConditionalOnMissingBean  RestTemplate restTemplate(ClientHttpRequestFactory clientHttpRequestFactory,      ClientHttpRequestInterceptor httpClientLoggingInterceptor, RestTemplateBuilder builder) {    builder.requestFactory(() -> clientHttpRequestFactory);    builder.additionalInterceptors(httpClientLoggingInterceptor);    return builder.build();  }```every place I use the rest template, I need to inject the builder instead then? 
solution: 

issue: @bclozel I have confused about it these days.  Thank you for answering my question. 
solution: 

issue: @RaviShekhawat it’s not very clear what you’re trying to do really 
solution: 

issue: It depends entierely of the cache store you’re using and the kind of db you’re using. Benchmarks are hard so unless you share the benchmark itself so that others can run it, I am not sure we can help you effectively The cache abstraction uses a by key lookup, you may want to switch to a different cache provider for a start Your DB has already a cache in the driver. if your HTTP endpoint does lookup by id, the DB should already be pretty fast to resolve those I am still not sure what you’re trying to bench with a lookup by id 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll Please suggest some standard way for benchmarking of my redis vs mysql implementation. 
solution: 

issue: There are other reasons to add a cache, but you typically add a cache in response to a performance issue that can't be addressed through other optimizations Think about it this way:  take any method/function that's performing slowly.  Now, put a hashmap in its scope and use that to cache the results.  Does the resulting code make sense?  Is it elegant/testable/maintainable/correct?  If not, don't use a cache

issue: Is there a way of getting spring to initialize log4j2 logging without having a log4j2.[yml/json/properties] in my classpath?I have a file called `log4j2-common.yml` and log4j2-[<env name>].yml, and I set up log4j2 using the property `log4j.configurationFile`, except unless I have `log4j2.yml` in my classpath (even if it's an empty file), spring doesn't seem to use my log4j2 logging configuration. Also, does spring add its own console appender or something? Even if I turn off logging in the root logger, messages logged on error or above show up on the console?

solution: 

issue: @Redmancometh Do you recommend upgrading to Spring Boot >=2.0? I’m using 1.5.19. 
solution: 

issue: @Redmancometh I think I’m getting closer! I upgraded to 2.1.2.RELEASE and gradle, and so far the results are promising. 
solution: 

issue: @Redmancometh I’m close (I think). I’m returning my JSONArray as a string but now getting an error that my entire JSON string could be resolve a template. Do you have any insight into that error? Yes, but I’m not trying to use it. I removed thymeleaf and now get a 404 for my route. That was my mistake. I had @Controller instead of @RestController. Thank you! 
solution: 

issue: Weird are you using thymeleaf/etc? If you have no templating engine that error shouldn't happen You generally get that when you have thymeleaf/etc enabled and no corresponding .html file for the page template uh do you have a @RestController annotation? And have the path set to /? You also might try /api then you do /api/getmappingpath np

issue: hm ok well when removing it it doesn't show the error anymore, so not sure what to think :D 
solution: 

issue: I can't say as I don't know what's in your `application.properties` file. Generally speaking, there's no need for it to be filtered by Maven at build time 
solution: 

issue: hm the app.properties has the usual stuff (appname/liquibase/metrics/etc.). This include of scdf.sh with filtering is to be able to use variables inside the .sh file which would be replaced because of this flag. the shell script only contains this, with variables to replace```#!/usr/bin/env bashapp unregister --name @project.artifactId@ --type taskapp register --name @project.artifactId@ --type task --uri docker:registry.docker.example.com/example/@project.artifactId@:@project.version@```tried without the filtering flag, still excludes the application-*.properties file. Without filtering, variables dont get replaced however.

issue: @wilkinsona Thanks a lot Also, I've posted additional info on why the limitation exists in the first place https://stackoverflow.com/a/54537358/211794Can you please correct if my analysis is wrong 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona when i copy the `ExceptionTranslator ` from external jar to inside my project it will give an exception. ```ConflictingBeanDefinitionException: Annotation-specified bean name 'exceptionTranslator' for bean class [com.carbook.api.errors.ExceptionTranslator] conflicts with existing, non-compatible bean definition of same name and class [com.carbook.bookings.advice.ExceptionTranslator]```I'm presuming, because of this exception, that spring-boot can access the `ExceptionTranslator ` from inside jar. But the `@ExceptionHandler` method isn't invoked. Not sure if my assumption is correct though. 
solution: 

issue: Depends on the content type. If it's supposed to be `application/json`, then it doesn't look right to me. If it's supposed to be `application/stream+json` then it could be OK 
solution: I wrote a RestTemplate request to get the response from a Splunk server. 

issue: The depends on the capabilities of whatever you're using to process the JSON It's most likely to be Jackson AFAIK, Jackson doesn't support that out of the box. Why not try it and see? 
solution: 

issue: @vikpandey  it should work if you have defined SplunkEntity properly 
solution: 

issue: actually the splunk REST endpoint is created by another team. I don't have access of that information. I am using the splunk REST endpoint in my application. 
solution: 

issue: @vikpandey something is not right from the REST endpoint response is it being actively developed as a custom ? 
solution: 

issue: @vikpandey you are missing the context.. the API you were accessing is supposed to be exportable.. so am not sure what implementer was thinking.. to just export and not use or decrypt *deserialize or serialize if you were trying to do something that's not the end point expecting.. you get such results.. why are you calling a export endpoint if you need list if you can search them yes.. https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.2.4/RESTREF/RESTsearch#search.2Fjobs.2Fexport look at that endpoint that's exactly same as search/jobs if you use the regular endpoint not the exportable one..it may work but like you said.. as you are accessing a custom endpoint.. then am not sure what the implementer mindset was which you can only verify with the guy internally 
solution: 

issue: but you mentioned.. as custom one. Isn't it? actually the splunk REST endpoint is created by another team. I don't have access of that information. I am using the splunk REST endpoint in my application. use the standard /search/jobs and see if you can get the results as expected https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.2.4/RESTREF/RESTsearch#search.2Fjobs ok.. try the standard without export and same search options and see if it works..then you can isolate that one to just export endpoint being not properly configured or implemented 
solution: 

issue: yea, I mean they created it. I was not sure, if they just used the standard one or they customized it

issue: Hi all. I am trying to get Spring Webflux CORS set up for development with React. I've tried a LOT of StackOverflow solutions and a handful of blog posts. I have it working fine until I put Spring Security on the classpath. At that point, if I fiddle with it, I can get GET methods working but not POST. Any suggestions? I can post code if need be. 
solution: 

issue: @Redmancometh is this why? `Caused by: java.io.FileNotFoundException: class path resource [org/springframework/security/config/annotation/authentication/configurers/GlobalAuthenticationConfigurerAdapter.class] cannot be opened because it does not exist` 
solution: 

issue: thanks @lcg0124 , I'll do that.  but I was wondering, before starting the implementation, if some  one had experiens similar use case and if it is highly problematic 
solution: 

issue: If the way I wrote my question does not help mich, I'd appreciate you letting me know and giving me another chance to ask again 
solution: 

issue: @gsilvapt It looks like you're using Spring Data JPA. You might want to ask in the Spring Data room (https://gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-data) 
solution: 

issue: You have something that isn't compatible with Spring Boot 2 on the classpath. `ErrorAttributes` is in `org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.error`. What's the full stack trace? 
solution: 

issue: I am trying to programatically load properties from the environment on appliction startup, however I can't seem to get it work when implementing `ApplicationContextInitializer<ConfigurableApplicationContext>`. I'm launching my application like this:```new SpringApplicationBuilder(Application.class) .initializers(new ContextInitializer()) .run(args);```And then in the initialize method:```@Overridepublic void initialize(ConfigurableApplicationContext applicationContext) {    Properties properties = createPropertiesFromEnvironment();    applicationContext.getEnvironment().getPropertySources().addFirst(new PropertiesPropertySource("properties", properties));        LOG.info("Context successfully initialized with properties");}```But that seems to not load the properties early enough for [this Azure sample](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/azure/spring-framework/configure-spring-boot-starter-java-app-with-azure-key-vault?view=azure-java-stable#configure-and-compile-your-app) to work correctly.However, if I remove the interface and supply the spring application like this and add my properties:```SpringApplication app = new SpringApplication(Application.class);ContextInitializerStatic.initialize(app);app.run(args);```And then the initialize method:``` public static void initialize(SpringApplication app) { var session = new ContextInitializerStatic();     app.setDefaultProperties(session.createPropertiesFromEnvironment());        LOG.info("Context successfully initialized with properties");}```This second approach works, is this an acceptable approach or will I shoot myself in the foot later? 
solution: 

issue: The jar spring-boot-data-starter doesn't contains any class, how does it work? I also see a file named spring.provides; what's the use of this file? 
solution: 

issue: @hochas I must be missing something. The missing property seems to be `dataLakeClientSecret` but I can't see anything in that Gist that sets that property 
solution: 

issue: No, the conditions on the imported classes will have no effect on whether or not the importing class is processed However, the conditions on the importing class must match for the imported classes to actually be imported 
solution: 

issue: @hochas Sorry I just found my mistake.  I was trying to inject into an object that was being created by my code as opposed to the container.  A rookie mistake 
solution: 

issue: Is there not a general spring framework chat? 
solution: 

issue: Hi @karesti - this part of the codebase is not my forte, but spring-projects/spring-boot#12523 is fixed in Spring Boot 2.1.1 and the reporter in your case is using Spring Boot 2.1.2. So IMO it's a different instance of that issue or something specific to this sample (in the way it's using the classloader or something else?).Unless @snicoll or @wilkinsona have a hunch, I think a new issue containing a link to that sample is the best course of action. 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll Tristan told me he had a similar (if not the same exact) error in the past, when shade plugin was not up to date in infinispan I was using a parent pom that brought an old version when I checked in the plugin dependencies with maven. but is unrelated 
solution: 

issue: @ivange94 there is a #spring-data channel for that 
solution: 

issue: I know.. sorry about that.. when I started asking the question I didn’t explain myself correctly.. thanks a lot for your answers @snicoll that is perfectly fine 
solution: Best personal guess is when 17 is out. 

issue: @jonbrmasson `ServerPropertiesAutoConfiguration` was removed in Spring Boot 2.0. It looks like `com.greenqloud.usage.Main`, or something that it is pulling in, isn't compatible with Spring Boot 2.x. I can't explain why it only happens in your Kubernetes cluster. Perhaps there's a custom condition that means something only kicks in in that environment? 
solution: 

issue: Spring Boot considers a database to be embedded if it's running in the same process as the application. Specifically, H2, Derby, and HSQLDB can all be identified as an embedded database. In Spring Boot's terms, EmbeddedPostgres isn't embedded. 
solution: That's covered in the next paragraph of the current documentation:> Setter injection should primarily only be used for optional dependencies that can be assigned reasonable default values within the class. Otherwise, not-null checks must be performed everywhere the code uses the dependency. One benefit of setter injection is that setter methods make objects of that class amenable to reconfiguration or re-injection later. Management through JMX MBeans is therefore a compelling use case for setter injection.. 

issue: The documentation answers it within the context of that version. But I'm trying to understand the switch from the older one. They both make good arguments Because, iirc, setter injection is for the optional dependencies. 
solution: 

issue: @kalnida1 You can't override a private method so I now realise I don't understand the description of your code's structure. I'll take a look again if you're able to share something. 
solution: does spring-boot provide any readymade support for social login? I have googled it, yes there are social-core and related dependencies, but none of them solves the purpose of handling social login. They are used to retrive data from social apps.Also, someone told me that latest release of Spring contains automatic creation of users, if they login using social providers. But he never responded on the solution added by spring.Note, I want to create this social login feature through a REST api built using spring-boot.. 

issue: Good Night for All,I'm migrating my project Spring to Spring Boot. But I'm faced with a problem, we have a reverse proxy using apache and mod_cluster. In actual version we declare a Listerner in the server.xml.<Listener className="org.jboss.modcluster.container.catalina.standalone.ModClusterListener" advertise="false" proxyList="${proxyList}" />I put it like a Spring boot application.    private Connector ajpConnector() {        Connector connector = new Connector("AJP/1.3");        connector.setPort(8009);        connector.setRedirectPort(8443);        return connector;    }    private ModClusterListener modCluster() {        ModClusterListener modClusterListener = new ModClusterListener();        modClusterListener.setAdvertise(false);        modClusterListener.addProxy("10.1.1.34", 6666);        modClusterListener.setProxyURL(proxyUrl);        return modClusterListener;    }    @Bean    public WebServerFactoryCustomizer<TomcatServletWebServerFactory> servletContainer() {        return server -> {            if (server != null) {                server.addContextLifecycleListeners(modCluster());                server.addAdditionalTomcatConnectors(ajpConnector());            }        };    }But it don't work, the ModClusterListener want a LifecycleEvent of type Sever, but it never happen. Can anyone help me? 
solution: 

issue: @hdutra From what you've said, it sounds like `ModClusterListener` needs to be added to Tomcat's `Server` but the method you've used will add it to the `Context`. You could use a context customizer and navigate up from the `Context` till you find the `Server` or you could use a `TomcatServletWebServerFactory` sub-class instead:``` @Bean public TomcatServletWebServerFactory tomcatFactory() {  return new TomcatServletWebServerFactory() {   @Override   protected TomcatWebServer getTomcatWebServer(Tomcat tomcat) {    tomcat.getServer().addLifecycleListener(modCluster());    return new TomcatWebServer(tomcat);   }  }; }``` @gitmnd This room is for Spring Boot, if you have a question related to Spring Cloud, please ask in https://gitter.im/spring-cloud/spring-cloud In fact there's even a room specifically for Sleuth: https://gitter.im/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth

issue: I have a controller that returns Page<ReportRow> serialized to JSON. I want to find an elegant way of adding some metadata to the ReportRow’s based on some business rules (rules that involves doing additional db queries). what are my best options? 
solution: 

issue: My instinct was to have a service take the ReportRow and enrich them to a ReportRowApiDto with the additional values, but a collegue said we can use AOP for that. Coming from scala I'm not very familiar with all the annotations and magic that's happening in spring :) 
solution: 

issue: what about it? If the condition does not match, import won’t be processed 
solution: 1) It seemed like my import was getting processed but i can double check in a test.  2) The question is if this is a valid approach - keeping all conditionals in autoconfig only and leaving standard configurations as-is with just @bean primarily.. That goes back then to my question - is is considered good practice to mix and match these @Conditionals?  I see what you are saying but for us right now the @Configurations are non-conditional and we only have those @Conditionals in autoconfigs.. 

issue: I know what @Import does - i was asking what the interplay is of @Import in combination with @Conditional - that was clear above I thought.  Then that led into what is the best way to apply @Configurations.  Seems like a natural transition of questions but I will try to work up an example, i just dont want to flood this chat with code examples. 
solution: You don’t have to and I already replied to that question. If a condition does not match, `@Import` won’t be processed. I was asking for a sample in github or something. I find code snippet in general pretty useless.

solution: 

issue: @chad_d_stud_twitter I would avoid `JSONObject` entirely. Generally we recommend returning a POJO and then allowing HTTP codecs (WebFlux) or message converters (MVC) to turn it into JSON. @sklaholz You can learn about the reasons for the restrictions in https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/14773 
solution: 

issue: @chad_d_stud_twitter still it's a lot easier to grasp what your API returns. I've had the "joy" to work with systems that sent around some form of `JSONObject`both internally and via API and it's really tough to do anything if you're not the original author knowing what properties are used. There might be reasons to use such low level data structures, but if it's about your own parts fof the system I always would prefer actual objects that communicate what they contain and do

solution: 

issue: Yeah that’s the use case I’d personnaly like to move elsewhere. I don’t think the site should be used to discover what you can do because there are a bunch of things that aren’t there. There are, for instance, interesting 3rd party integrations we don’t list and not all projects are listed either. We focus on the getting started experience there which doesn’t give much space for things you may want to add when you have something off the ground. Again, there are much more we support or others support that is not on that list.

Now that the list is gone, where do I go to see the available dependencies? IntelliJ seems to be one option....

issue: First time using Spring Boot 2 (2.1.3) and this thing about security doesn't appear to be true at all> Once users decide that they want to add custom security, the default security configuration provided by Spring Boot will back off completely. I've got my `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` but the `HttpSecurity` passed to it has all sorts of defaults configured (csrf, headers, basic auth, etc.) Oh, that's the defaults from Spring Security, not Boot. I remember now.

issue: Hi. I'm start using kubernetes with spring boot. For readiness probe I target /actuator/health endpoint. If my database falls down (for example) health returns 503 and communication with my app is over.... but the problem is that I lost all the observability offers by actuator framework (So I can't used my health endpoint anymore to know exactly where is the problem..) Did someone already dealt with this kind of problem ? 
solution: 

issue: I have created an [issue over at Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55353895/requirements-for-properties-being-resolved-with-configurationproperties), I'd appreciate it very much if someone could give me some pointers how I could resolve my problem.

solution: 

issue: I have this in my `WebClient` configuration (Spring Boot version `2.0.3`, reactor extra version `3.1.6.RELEASE`)```java.retryWhen(Retry.anyOf(RuntimeException.class, ReadTimeoutException.class)  .retryMax(maxRetryAttempt)  .backoff(Backoff.exponential(Duration.ofMillis(1000L), Duration.ofSeconds(30), 3, true))  .jitter(Jitter.random(0.9))  .doOnRetry(retryContext -> logger.error("[Retry count: {}][Retry Backoff: {}][Throwable: {}]", retryContext.iteration(), retryContext.backoff(), retryContext.exception())))```Our log file shows:```2019-03-26 10:37:21.878 [ERROR] Thread: reactor-http-client-epoll-16 [Retry count: 1][Retry Backoff: PT1.063S][Throwable: 1]2019-03-26 10:37:22.947 [ERROR] Thread: reactor-http-client-epoll-12 [Retry count: 2][Retry Backoff: PT5.663S][Throwable: 2]```I have couple of questions:- Does `WebClient` assign different threads for each retry? Or, is it possible?- Why `retryContext.exception()` prints numeric values like `1, 2` instead of the error message (if not stack trace)? 
solution: 

issue: @bclozel  we do not have `publishOn` or `subscribeOn` in our code. So, your explnation helps me understand the `(1)` behavior. But the point `(2)` is weird, `retryContext.exception()` should print the error message from the `Throwable` instance; not these numbers. Should I ask this in `reactor` channel? 
solution: 

issue: I doesn't sound specific to reactor, as the method signatures and types check out; the reactor team might help here. In any case, a small repro project will be useful as I'm not sure they'll spot the problem just by looking at this code snippet 
solution: 

issue: sure, this is happening in one of our production code (as part of a bigger issue related to `reactor-netty` which I am still analyzing). Let me see if i can put up a sample code. Thanks for the help. @bclozel Appreciate if you could provide some hint.- Does `WebClient` maintain any kind of connection pool? - If so, how to refresh/renew the connections in case they become stale (may be firewall or destination server has already closed those connections)?The context of these questions is, we are seeing a lot of `reactor.core.Exceptions$ReactiveException: java.io.IOException: Connection closed prematurely` in our server log and we are thinking it could be related to https://github.com/reactor/reactor-netty/issues/498 . 
solution: 

issue: @nnanda2016 Yes, WebClient (actually the reactor netty client underneath) is pooling HTTP connections. I'm not sure you can manually "refresh" those connections. AFAIK the connection pool might be unbounded and you can't just loop over the existing connections. For more about the actual behavior of the reactor netty connection pool, the reactor team should know better. Especially about when and how invalid connections are discarded.

issue: @iammohsinar is MySQL and the driver you're using supporting that feature? I'm aware of some datastores supporting this, like mongodb but it's not universal. https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/mongodb/docs/2.1.5.RELEASE/reference/html/#tailable-cursors As far as I understand, your code snippet is doing a "SELECT *" on that table and streaming the data (but not keeping the cursor opened)

Any clues as to `why` this method is being called?  If it is supposed to be called, `why` is it calling this class and not something like, `FileResource#getUrl()` instead?

issue: How would that work exactly? 
solution: 

issue: @tonisostrat I read a lot on it, mostly the general advice is just don't make circular dependencies. In my case the @RefreshScope does make it a bit specific.Switching to setter injection using @Lazy on the setter parameter does seem to work, but it's not as elegant as constructor injection with `Optional`.

issue: hi i need to document the personal info we are storing in our db and i was thinking on writing custom annotations in the fields and then somehow parse them and dump the result somewhere. im here looks for ideas on other options and how to go about it. 
solution: 

issue: @tonisostrat It depends on the nature of the failure. I can't recall a place in Spring Boot itself where we've wanted to fail. We generally try to back off rather than failing. Can you provide a bit more context? 
solution: 

issue: let's say that my configuration is dependent on an environment property and it doesn't exist in the environment 
solution: 

issue: Why not use `@ConditionalOnProperty` and back off if the property isn't there? If you want to fail, throwing any exception will work. To make things easier for users of your auto-configuration, you may want to consider using a custom exception type and adding a `FailureAnalyzer` for it. 
solution: 

issue: i can't use a Conditional because the property is namespaced. my configuration registers X amount of beans in the context dynamically 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I don't see any specific changes concerning the starter-activemq but after migrate from 2.0 to 2.1 version of spring boot JmsListener on AMQ doesn't work anymore.. When I set the log level to debug Before 2.1 version I saw something like "o.a.a.t.failover.FailoverTransport       : Connection established" , then in loop --> "org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQSession      : ID:ebox-validator-190-2jrmt-38283-1554372401859-1:1:1 Transaction Commit :null" ... after migrate to spring 2.1 no logs anymore , no connection with the broker anymore.... Any idea ? 
solution: 

issue: If you're not getting anything to do with ActiveMQ, I would suspect that you may have a corrupted dependency jar which has caused the auto-configuration to back off. Try starting your app with `--debug` and comparing the condition evaluation report that is output by the two versions.

solution: if you can share that from a mini sample you create from start.spring.io I can have a look for sure. 

issue: Found the issue. The additional metadata file needs to be copied to the the `target/classes/META-INF/` directory before running the annotation processor. 
solution: The annotation processor works as long as it is on the class path. For properties defined in scala the annotation processor needs to be called separately. But it works. 

issue: Nothing to do with relaxed binding please review the javadoc of `@ConditionalOnProperty` relaxed binding works for that or simple environment calls as long as the input uses the canonical format No, sorry That’s using the property, not declaring it

Previously we just declared a custom `JobLauncher` bean that overrided the existing one in the application, but not possible after upgrade to spring boot 2.1 (unless specified by property) 
solution: 

issue: I don't think this is a problem with Boot's auto-configuration. It will back off when you declare your own `SessionRepository` bean It looks like a couple of Spring Session problems to me:1. It seems to rely on bean definition overriding to allow a custom `SessionRepository` to be configured2. When bean definition overriding is permitted, RedisHttpSessionConfiguration makes some assumptions about the type of the SessionRepository which do not hold true @herveDarritchon I see you've already been discussing this in https://gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-session. It would have been courteous to mention that to avoid people wasting time duplicating effort If I were you, I would open a Spring Session issue. Ideally, Spring Session would allow repository customization with bean definition overriding disabled. Putting that aside, I think a change is still needed to RedisHttpSessionConfiguration regardless I would guess, but can't tell from a truncated stack trace, that the property is coming from the bean definition So the question becomes, what has set the property on the bean definition?

solution: 

issue: Yes, but the file exists. The problem seams to be that it’s a file in a jar in a jar. If I don’t run the app as a fat jar the file is found and jolokia works as expected. So it must be a classloader issue then runing the app as a fat jar...

issue: Hi, I would like to migrate my spring boot application from properties to yaml file. While I was reading the documentation I found this : [24.7.4 YAML Shortcomings](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-external-config-yaml-shortcomings)``` YAML files cannot be loaded by using the @PropertySource annotation. So, in the case that you need to load values that way, you need to use a properties file.```Actually I use the annotation ```@PropertySource ``` and it is working correctly with properties file as with yaml file.Someone can explain to me if I am doing something wrong or there are an error inside the springboot documentation ? 
solution: 

issue: I have just open an issue on github 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll I am using some @Value to check the value inside the yaml file 
solution: It could come from another source, that doesn’t mean that file was loaded. I can try to change the  value inside the yaml file and check easily if it is the value inside the yaml file. After testing (Change a property value inside my application.yaml), my new value is correctly inject in my @Value annotation. 

issue: Perhaps you have a `fwk-api` profile that is active. Sprig Boot will load `application-*.yml` automatically (making your propertysource useless) 
solution: 

issue: @hbrands Your second application context is hidden away in the `restServlet` `@Bean` method. When you create the `MockMvc` instance in your test, you're using the main application context. As a result, it can't find any of the controllers that are only known to this hidden context. Given that you're using `@SpringBootTest` with a random port, you could use rest template or web client and make actual HTTP calls to test your app If you want to use `MockMvc`, you'll need to get at the hidden application context and pass that to mock mvc

solution: 

issue: @DoraRajappan Sorry, I can't tell without some more context. Related, but probably not the cause of your problem: it's quite unusual to be using XML configuration, even just for tests, in a Spring Boot app. Is there something stopping you from using Java config instead?

solution: Yeah, it's not hard to find, but they seem to be making it as hard as they can while still being OSS. We should respect that, I think.. With regards to pooling, yes, when using Atomikos or Bitronix, you need to use their connection pools. That's how the connections and the work that they do against the database get enlisted in the XA transaction.. You can still use spring.datasource.url and the like to configure the DataSource, but it will then be pooled by the transaction manager rather than Hikari.

solution: 

issue: @DoraRajappan, if you have* that third-party jar on the classpath* spring annotations in that jar* a local class with `@ComponentScan` pointing to the base package in that jar* that class also getting picked up by Spring's annotation scanthen it should just work. if it doesn't then one of the things i listed is obviously missing.

solution: In a production application that uses Spring Boot 2.1.4 with logback 1.2.3, I see some `.tmp` files remaining. I have read https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45693107/define-logback-shutdown-hook-in-spring-boot/45693867 but it is unclear what is the best way at this point in time. One solution states you should edit the logback config, the other states you can use a property in `application.properties` and the 3rd answer states that it should be automatic since logback 1.1.10. I have configured my logging using a `logback-spring.xml` file like this:```<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><configuration>    <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/defaults.xml"/>    <springProfile name="dev,local">        <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/console-appender.xml" />        <root level="INFO">            <appender-ref ref="CONSOLE" />        </root>    </springProfile>    <springProfile name="staging,prod">        <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/file-appender.xml"/>        <root level="INFO">            <appender-ref ref="FILE"/>        </root>    </springProfile></configuration>```.

solution: 

issue: I even tried to use an ApplicationListener for the ApplicationReadyEvent but it still only loads the bootstrap.yaml into the environment not the application.yaml 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona It seems that although I am able to add breakpoints and extra the application.properties when the proper context executes EnvironmentPostProcessor and return early if its the cloud context that executes, the setting of `logging.level.pattern` inside the propertySources map does not do nothing. I'm thinking that it's because it uses the cloud context call to do any configurations to the log format and the later call of the other standard context gets ignored somehow. Any idea where the value property value of `logging.level.pattern` is used programmatically so I can try to implement my logic there instead? 
solution: 

issue: @tatumalenko Are you using `logging.level.pattern` in your implementation? The property should be `logging.pattern.level` 
solution: That system property is then consumed by Logback (or Log4j2). 

issue: Something I have never understood:     @Override      protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {  http   .authorizeRequests()    .antMatchers("/css/**", "/index").permitAll()      .antMatchers("/user/**").hasRole("USER")       .and()   .formLogin()    .loginPage("/login").failureUrl("/login-error");           } Why are some lines joined with a .and() but other lines aren't?

issue: Hi, anyone has any clue about this exception? ```.a.catalina.session.StandardManager     : Exception loading sessions from persistent storagejava.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.StackTraceElement cannot be cast to java.lang.String```My app was working fine and today this popped up... the session is lost in every server restart (live reload / devtools)No files from my project appear in the stack trace 
solution: 

issue: @cemivb What's the stack trace of the `ClassCastException`? 
solution: I just noticed the only file that appears in the stack trace, is the application's main class. Yesterday I had the same exception, and it was something related to the scanBasePackages thing that I fixed including a class from every high level project package. Sessions persistence between every restart was workingthis morning  I started the server again without adding any new class, and the exception came back. I have tried cleaning the project (I se eclipse), deleting the sessions.ser files, and all suggestions that I found on stackoverflow but the error remains there. @SubhamAshish Can you share the full stack trace of the repackaging failure please?. 

issue: @cemivb Looks like https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/9457. You've added something to your HTTP session that isn't serialisable. 
solution: 

issue: I suspect it does. Looks like you're using Vaadin and it's storing stuff in the HTTP session. You might want to speak to them about it and if they expect Vaadin to work with DevTools. 
solution: Indeed it works, I have been using them together for 4 months now and the only problem I having is the session persistence with devtools. I made a small project to test spring security with Vaadin together and it works perfectly, the problem came when adding the same functionality to my big project. Im gonna just redo everything I did yesterday to see If Im able to get to the point I was when everything worked good.... 

issue: @wilkinsona I saw the link. The author exposed a case when a non serializable object is set explicitely to the session, in my case Im not... Thanks for the feedback, Im already watching the setAttribute method and Vaadin seems to be adding its own stuff by itself to the session, so Ill have to figure out why is not working in my main project but does work in the simplest one

solution: 

issue: @molexx Test contexts are cached by default. You can disable that using `@DirtiesContext`. You may want to review your test configuration and try and share it between test classes so that they can share a context too. 
solution: 

issue: how to redirect to login page after session time out http.sessionManagement().invalidSessionUrl("/login?expired") is not working 
solution: 

issue: Presumably your colleague also wrote some code that did something with it 
solution: In my opinion,I thought it should be spring.datasource.url but it's not. For full integration you probably want `@SpringBootTest`. 

issue: That's expected with `@WebFluxTest` which filters out any non-controller beans You'll need to provide a mock for the facade. You can use `@MockBean` for that You can't use a `TestExecutionListener` without any other Spring stuff. The `TestContext` that is passed to the various `TestExecutionListener` callback methods provides access to an `ApplicationContext`. 
solution: 

issue: aah okay so if i wanted to write more integration - like tests? what you suggested solves my problem btw :) thanks 
solution: 

issue: If you don't need any other Spring stuff, I doubt you want to use its runner. Why not use JUnit's standard callbacks? If you used JUnit 5, its myriad extension points will give you a `TestExecutionListener` equivalent 
solution: 

issue: That's up to you. IIRC, it'll fail unless you give it some configuration. That configuration will allow you to control what do and does not get scanned.

solution: 

issue: I assume it's not a blank Boot app either. Work out what it is that you've enabled/(auto)configured that causes it.

solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona , thanks so much! will do. 
solution: I am writing an open source library that will help with testing MongoDB apps, specially with Spring Data Mongo. One of the features I want is to dynamically override whatever the developer specified for the database name in the configuration, so if it was `mydb`, I'd dynamically change it to `mydb-test `or something like that.  I was able to find out how to intercept the `spring.data.mongodb.uri` property and override it with my custom URI. The way I am doing it is by defining `resources/META-INF/spring.factories`, specifying `org.springframework.context.ApplicationListener=my.custom.ClassName` where I am implementing `ApplicationListener<ApplicationEnvironmentPreparedEvent>` interface. That intercepts the property and re-injects it with the value I want back into the `ConfigurableEnvironment`. That's all well and good, however, I am obviously not guaranteed that the developer is using the standard spring property. What if they are defining their own `MongoClient` or `MongoTemplate` which is what they are using to execute DB interactions. Is there a similar interface I can specify in `spring.factories` and implement it such that I am defining the `MongoClient` (or whatever) myself and overriding whatever the developer did by default?.

solution: 

issue: @thackel yeah, but that's not what `spring-boot-maven-plugin` does 
solution: @OrangeDog i checked it here. my boot projects are repackaged again and there is works. (dep A has optional config-processor and is being used in dep B which is packaged by boot-maven plugin). so this is a different scenario than yours.

solution: 

issue: @venkatasreekanth As of Tomcat 9, there's no acceptor thread count. Tomcat uses the connection timeout as the default for its keep alive timeout so you can use `server.connection-timeout` to set it. If you want the keep alive timeout and connection timeout to have different values, you'll have to use a `TomcatConnectorCustomizer`. 
solution: 

issue: @oknozor you may need a `@DateTimeFormat` on it as well 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona so, it does work specifying them on the maven-compiler-plugin, either as dependencies or annotationProcessingPath, however dependency management doesn't work there. 
solution: 

issue: @wsm1990 thanks. I am aware of that, but there are two resources paths, one for tests and src/test/resources and src/main/resources, I was not sure if both are available at testing time. Anyways I ended up doing without liquibase, hibernate ddl was enough in my case.

issue: Hey guys, we were able to solve the issue why the list of EntityCacheStats was emtpy in the autoconfig. MeterRegistry uses a MeterRegistryPostProcessor which is looking for MeterBinders through an ObjectProvider ```(ObjectProvider<MeterBinder> meterBinders)``` to instantiate them. Through this call the EntityCacheMetrics was created.``` @Bean    public EntityCacheMetrics entityCacheMetrics(List<? extends EntityCacheStats> caches) {        return EntityCacheMetrics.of(caches); //public class EntityCacheMetrics implements MeterBinder {    }```` At this point Spring wasn't able to find and instantiate beans which implement the EntityCacheStats because our Config returned an ExtendedClientDetailsService (Interface)``` @Configuration public class EntityCacheConfiguration {    @Bean    public ExtendedClientDetailsService clientDetailsService(ClientDetailsRepository clientDetailsRepository,            StaticClientProperties clientProperties) {        return new CachedClientDetailsService(clientDetailsRepository, clientProperties);    }```The real implementation looks like this```public class CachedClientDetailsService extends EntityCacheService<ClientDetails, UUID> implements ExtendedClientDetailsService { //public abstract class EntityCacheService<T, ID> implements EntityCacheStats```It implements both the ExtendedClientDetailsService interface and the EntityCacheStats interface. Spring couldn't know at this point that the real implementation implements the EntityCacheStats interface as well.That's the reason why @Component and @Service worked because it returns the real implementation.

On Sender side 15/20 connections plugged to broker X. On consumer side 15/20 connections plugged on broker Y... So performance problem ?

issue: I'm not sure how to structure or search for that issue on SO 
solution: 

issue: Guys, What is the environment variable format for SPRING BOOT VAULT in the docker-compose file? 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona  Thank you Andy, Will try to directly call snakeYAML 
solution: 

issue: @peterluttrell_twitter assuming you're talking about the default error messages in Spring Boot + the missing context support in WebFlux: unlike servlet, there is no standard error pages at the server level. We've got error handlers which are tied to the dispatcher handler. The filters are applied before/after that in the chain and they don't know about the whole codecs+error handling infrastructure.You could technically achieve that, but you'd have to replicate quite a lot of infrastructure of the Spring Boot error handling. 
solution: 

issue: with that workaround you're getting the formatted spring Boot error response? 
solution: 

issue: ok, I didn't think it would - I thought you'd only get a 404, and not the JSON error response. Cool! This seems like a reasonable workaround in the meantime 
solution: 

issue: [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/q19f/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/q19f/image.png) Why is it always blocked? 
solution: 

issue: @pariaSadatHosseiny it means that Spring Boot cannot render the error page, since the application already started writing the response. At that point, we can't write the error page because it would lead to garbage content in the response. In this case, it seems that the HTTP client disconnected while the server was writing the response. There's nothing you can do here. 
solution: 

issue: you could increase your odds by actually asking your question 
solution: 

issue: @OrangeDog I don’t think that matters at all given the description. Using the processor is about saving milliseconds and would only affect them if they had a lot of custom auto-configurations 
solution: 

issue: check connection and JPA configuration - that's going to want to connect to everything and run various queries at startup 
solution: 

issue: ah, yes, I thought they meant half of the available CPUs 
solution: 

issue: What do you mean by "as they respond with my machine's IP address" ? 
solution: And both the response and the value of that field is not equal to the value of the `X-Forwarded-For` that I explicitly set, but to my own IP address. 

issue: @phillipuniverse  Thanks! I'll see about arranging things that way.I have questions, I think, but I'll try to work through them. 
solution: 

issue: Why is spring boot running scheduled tasks while building JAR file? 
solution: 

issue: @ericjturley feel free to raise an issue if you have ideas to improve it or something concrete to report 
solution: 

issue: @drs3114 That all looks reasonable from what I can see, but it's hard to offer much more than that when there's so much that I can't see. Perhaps you could strip things down into something minimal? That process would either help you find the problem along the way or give you and end result that I can look at in its entirety. 
solution: 

issue: Unfortunately, I don’t think you can expect this to work that way. Priority is usually effective with high concurrency What is that selector btw? 
solution: 

issue: That means jms does handle priorities with my code but it does not ensure it. it's kind of best effort? I my case I have one listening thread (`concurrency="1-1"`) and this thread puts some new messages into the queue as stated below. After the the messages ist handler and the thread is free again I would expect that it handles the message with higher priority next. But they get handled in the issued order ignoring priorities. I would be nice if that works but probably I find a different solution it does not.```  this.procQ.sendMsg( new DummyMsg() );  this.procQ.sendMsg( new DummyMsg() );  this.procQ.sendMsg( new DummyMsg() );  this.procQ.sendMsg( new DummyMsg() );  this.procQ.sendMsgAsPriority( new EnterMsg( newTesterState, oldTesterState ) );```

solution: 

issue: configuration does not always have to be in properties (so-called programming by properties). IMO, such setup is more clear using the API (`WebMvcConfigurer` lets you manage that, see the doc) 
solution: 

issue: Mockito v3.0.0 was recently released (8 July 2019). spring-boot-starter-test is using v2.28.2. Is there any sense of when this would be updated to v3.x ? Thanks. 
solution: @wisdotscottalyea_gitlab educated guess, the next major version of spring boot, spring boot doesn't upgrade major versions in minor releases. 

issue: hi, anyone worked on elastic search 
solution: 

issue: I am using spring-boot. What dependency should I include to make WebServiceTemplate work? 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll Thanks a lot. may I know which dependency should I include to use xpath api? 
solution: 

issue: yes, that's probably correct - if you know better, why are you asking ? ;-0 
solution:  Just I am confused about the difference between them and when to use each one.. https://stackoverflow.com/a/32288196/6717287. 

issue: @emmanuelidehen That depends, if you know spring framework already then it will be quite easy to learn springboot, if not, I suggest that you start with some courses on udemy.One of it is this [one](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/), there is also a lot of others, but it really depends on your needs and knowledge.

issue: How to prevent the springboot application shutdown when datasource gets down temporary. and When database comes back, application should work as expected. Currently, Temporary failure in database causes my springboot application to go down 
solution: 

issue: @shivanshugoyal0111 You’re looking in the wrong direction. Spring Boot does not shutdown the application when the DB is down at runtime 
solution: 

issue: @deepakmehra10  there is a #spring-data channel for that question 
solution: @vrgkwd it’s telling that you have incompatible versions on the class path. Make sure that the springfox version you’re using is compatible with the spring boot version. 

issue: I just started with Spring Boot. It works out of the box and I have basic API services running. I am looking for code examples (GET and POST) - is there a site which has a lot of examples?

issue: How to start the embedded ldap server (unboundid) in Spring Boot (2.1.5.RELEASE) with Webflux? I tried just adding the properties `spring.ldap.embedded.ldif` and `spring.ldap.embedded.base-dn` but I can't see any beans of `AuthenticationManager` 
solution: 

issue: Trying to get the embedded server, Spring boot with version 2.0.9.RELEASE and cloud starter 2.0.4.RELEASE and Zuul 1.4.0.RELEASE. Embedded server startup comes up with an error ServerPropertiesAutoConfiguration., any idea how to catch up with correct versions to work with., thanks 
solution: 

issue: If I were to propose a change in dependencies, do I just make a GitHub issue? 
solution: @OrangeDog That is a nice workaround!. 

issue: @xsreality I can see this:```partition 0, leader 1, replicas: 1,3,2, isrs: 2,3,1partition 1, leader 2, replicas: 2,1,3, isrs: 2,3,1partition 2, leader 3, replicas: 3,2,1, isrs: 2,3,1```

issue: HiPlease, can anyone share some good documentation on spring-boot version upgrade...?I'm trying to upgrade spring-boot 1.4.* 2 to 2.1.* and running with sme dependency isssues. I'm not much familired with maven dependencies. I have updated spring-boot version from 1.4.2 to 2.1.4 and related springframework dependencies. I am not sure why I am getting this issue Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.springframework.security.authentication.AuthenticationManager at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:382) ~[na:1.8.0_201] at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:424) ~[na:1.8.0_201] at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:349) ~[na:1.8.0_201] at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:357) ~[na:1.8.0_201] ... 41 common frames omitted 
solution: 

issue: @chinnareddy578 review the migration guide and make sure you’re not overridding dependencies in your build as it’s likely to bring incompatible versions on upgrade 
solution: 

issue: @michaelmcfadyen I am afraid not, this channel is about Spring Boot-related questions (auto-configurations, etc). If you have a sample that demonstrates the warnings, feel free to create a spring framework issue @CinnamonBagels I suggest moving that to #spring-cloud where this feature can be discussed. FTR, `@RefreshScope` is not limited to configuration properties @OrangeDog not sure I understood the “to a collection” part 
solution: 

issue: so, if I move ```doSomething``` to a different class, it would work fine ? I see, Thanks @vanseverk I will give your suggestion a try 
solution: 

issue: @prabhatcraz does it work now? :) 
solution: 

issue: continuing with my migration, I changed SB version to 2.0.9.RELEASE but the app fails starting with the message : org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'org.springframework.context.annotation.internalConfigurationAnnotationProcessor': Initialization of bean failed; nested exception is java.lang.NullPointerException...Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: null at org.springframework.core.BridgeMethodResolver.findBridgedMethod(BridgeMethodResolver.java:60)I assume it has to do with some version compatibility, but not quite sure what is not compatible with what. Spring Framework Core and BOM have version 5.0.13. Any hints will be greatly appreciated! 
solution: 

issue: @vanseverk @snicoll both of u were right, using the right starter parent was ... right but obviously not enough, had to make sure no other older version was pulled in by some other God forgotten dependency...that took some time to hunt down :h 
solution: 

issue: @t0920008899 Yes, but you should annotate implementations. 
solution: So I need to annotate both interface and implementation class?. np.

solution: 

issue: About the `AutoConfigureTestDatabase`, simply because if I set `replace = NONE` it’s ignored if I don’t have the JPA starter. 
solution: I have a project with just `spring-data-jpa` and `spring-boot-starter-test` as a dependency. Within that project, I can write a test class annotated with `@DataJpaTest` and running the test I see it loads an H2 database and runs queries against it. But, if I add `@AutoConfigureTestDatabase(replace = NONE)` to use my `application.yml` defined datasource it doesn’t work if I don’t have the `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` dependency.. It makes sense, I was just confused by the way it worked without that starter when using the in-memory database.. 

issue: “does not work” meaning it’s still replacing the database? 
solution: Yeah, it’s still replacing the database if it finds the H2 driver on the classpath; if I remove the driver, I gen an exception in the lines of “cannot find a bean for EntityManagerFactory”.. 

issue: I defined an interface (say Manager), and had a class (say ManagerImpl) annotated as Service implementing that interface. Can I just use Manager declaration type when I autowire a bean?

solution: 

issue: @davinkevin JIb is cool but DockerFile is the recipe. About real JVM, what is that stuff for glibc stuff? I don't follow you. 
solution: I am wrestling with AutoConfigurations.  We have "modules" which wire up @Beans per package (Similar to a Guice module).  Then we have "AutoConfigurations" that import those modules configurations (unless it is api most of the stuff is package-protected).  In trying to keep the configuration consolidated to the modules and not scattered between the autoconfigurations, regular configurations, and/or using a bunch of static inner classes to guide the autoconfig, can I do something like this below?  *It seems the @AutoConfigureBefore/After do not get applied.*  If I recall, it does if I create static inner classes in the AutoConfiguration to guide it.In the code below, I would of expected an error because of the two same beans being registered but no matter what I do it looks like the DefaultHttpConfiguration is running after the LocalHttpConfiguration and because of the @ConditionalOnMissingBean not getting configured.   Our scenario we are trying to achieve is have one bean always injected (qualified by @Local) and then a @Primary one which is the default (file, s3, etc.).  Right now I am just trying to make sense of what can be done as a pattern for other AutoConfiguration/Configuration modules.```@Import(value = {    LocalHttpConfiguration.class,    DefaultHttpConfiguration.class})public class MyWebAutoConfiguration{     ....@Configurationpublic class LocalHttpConfiguration{    @Bean    //@Local    @ConditionalOnClass(DiskFileItem.class)    FileService<HttpServletRequest> localHttpFileService(final WorkingFolder workingFolder)    ....@Configuration@AutoConfigureBefore(LocalHttpConfiguration.class)public class DefaultHttpConfiguration{    @Bean    //@Primary    @ConditionalOnMissingBean    @ConditionalOnClass(DiskFileItem.class)    FileService<HttpServletRequest> defaultHttpFileService(final WorkingFolder workingFolder)```. 

issue: I need to customise my POJO @wilkinsona 
solution: 

issue: @kjq they're in different package, right? So this should work out as expected. 
solution: 

issue: Cool.  We dont use @ComponentScanning at all (for better or worse) and choose to explicitly define our @Beans.  Packages, like File/S3/etc, have a configuration that exposes the beans.  We then are using the AutoConfigurations to import those and when needed use conditionals to turn on/off certain injections. 
solution: 

issue: Hey everyone.. this might be a rather spring-framework and not sprig-boot question - i'm not sure. So I have `WarehouseService` and `WarehouseServiceImpl` and then I declare a bean like this:```@Bean(name = "warehouseService")public WarehouseService defaultWarehouseService() {     return new WarehouseServiceImpl();}```then when I say `applicationContext.getType('warehouseService')` I get returned the interface `WarehouseService`. If I call it from another application context I get `WahouseServiceImpl$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB$`. How can I **always** get the `WarehouseServiceImpl`? I've put some annotations on the implementation class and if I get the interface `WarehouseService` I can't check if they are there.

issue: @wilkinsona I increased the livenessProbe to 5 min and finally found the reason of the failure, it was a liquibase locking issue. I implemented this solution https://stackoverflow.com/a/55525305 and sounds working. Is it possible to add an additional liquibase property to enable a such functionality on the LiquibaseAutoConfiguration? Beside that I am wondering if it’s a good solution.

solution: 

issue: I have a spring boot application that has SSL enabled, with a valid certificate and key.  Requests work from within it's container.  From outside of the container, the SSL handshake fails (based on tcpdump/wireshark) the server terminates the SSL session immediately after the "Client Hello" message from the client.  I've got identical symptoms for both undertow and tomcat... does anyone have any troubleshooting suggestions?  enabling trace logging doesn't provide any additional details.  i'm at my wit's end.  other tcp based applications work properly from within the container, and this container shows the same symptoms in multiple container environments on different OSs.  any suggestions for diagnostics? 
solution: 

issue: @ruckc Did you enable the JVM's SSL logging or only the embedded server's? If it was the latter, you could try running with `-Djavax.net.debug=ssl` and comparing the output of a request from inside the container with one from outside. Another thought: are requests from outside the container being tunnelled to the correct port inside the container? I think the symptom that you've described would happen if you tried to use SSL on a plain HTTP port. @ruckc That's surprising. What client were you using inside the container when it worked? 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona so it appears that between chrome, firefox, and multiple versions of curl outside the container, there is no cipher suites in common...

solution: 

issue: Hi! I noticed that with reactive support `ServerResponse` has been introduced. Is there something wrong with an endpoint returning `Mono<ResponseEntity<…>>` though? Does using `ServerResponse` give me some advantages? 
solution: 

issue: This way I can only throw Runtime Exceptions inside the writeTo implementation or lambda expression and If i do, it will result in a 404 File not found error. I still can't display any error message :S ```@GetMapping(value = "/download2")public StreamingResponseBody handle(HttpServletResponse response) { return outputStream -> {  var resource = resourceLoader.getResource("classpath:TestFileToRead.txt");  response.setContentType("application/x-download");  response.setHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=\"SomeFile.txt\"");  if (1 == 1 / 1) {   throw new RuntimeException("Test");  }  try (var inputStream = new FileInputStream(resource.getFile())) {   StreamUtils.copy(inputStream, outputStream);  } };}``` 
solution: 

issue: @bclozel What I am using currently (just the ServletResponse) is only writing the output and setting the headers after I rendered my pdf and I am praying not to get an exception afterwards. The main problem is solved with that, I just thought I am doing something really wrong. Also, it is really weird, that you can't change the headers. From the API, it looks like a simple setter. 
solution: 

issue: you can change them, but you can't remove them the thing is, once you start writing to the body the headers are committed and there is no way to change them anymore.

solution: 

issue: @ccellist yes... Your recommend is good for this case. My problem not only that. My question is `How to fields param become field select on jpa in Spring Data JPA?` 
solution: 

issue: @ccellist thanks... i have about 20 models need do like that. i need defines custom 20 times? @ccellist my english words not clean. sorry about that... 
solution: 

issue: @luanldt Your English is fine, don't worry. Without looking at your code I'm not sure if writing 20 separate implementations is necessary. It might be possible to abstract some code but you really might need 20 custom implementations to do what you want. In general, when I run into a situation like this I take a step back and consider if my design can't be improved to eliminate the problem a different way. This is why refactoring is so important. 
solution: 

issue: @iammohsinar You can't make an additive change via the properties. Using a configurer to add resources handlers, as you are doing in the snippet above, is the right approach if that's what you want to do.

issue: If you’re effectively affected by the vulnerability, yes (I’d bet you aren’t). If the work is done,  I am not sure why you ask. 2.1.8 is being staged so it should be available in the coming hours hopefully

issue: @rbnjay You're on the right track. Classes in `BOOT-INF/classes` won't be found, only those in the root of the jar. If the jar is intended to be used as a dependency, whoever is responsible for publishing it should publish a normal jar in place of or alongside the fat jar that's currently being published.

issue: Hello! I've deployed my Spring Boot application to Azure Kubernetes Service and I'm using their Ingress (nginx) to access my microservice, but I get the following error: `org.springframework.security.web.firewall.RequestRejectedException: The request was rejected because the URL was not normalized.`. My application works fine when deployed via Docker Compose and with nginx as a proxy & ssl termination. I understand what this error means, but don't know how to fix it on AKS.

issue: he mean's about some feature auto config in spring boot @timbotetsu_twitter i think that?  @guofeiwu is that you want? sorry my english not clean. but i'm not from China 
solution: 

issue: after the upgrade from `2.1.7.RELEASE` to `2.1.8.RELEASE` i get a `Caused by: java.lang.ArrayStoreException: sun.reflect.annotation.TypeNotPresentExceptionProxy` exception. its a pity that TNPEP does not show what type is missing. as its a quartz sub-project and it happens during `Error creating bean with name 'org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.quartz.QuartzAutoConfiguration$JdbcStoreTypeConfiguration$QuartzSchedulerDependencyConfiguration` and 2.1.8 changed something with quartz usage i might be related to this https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/pull/17539

issue: @jtheuer I am afraid not 
solution: Did you ever thought about moving the StringToDurationConverter stuff to spring-core?. 

issue: @spam-elgoog just for test,  if I have `a & b & c` there and running the app with all three profiles, getting the same behavior 
solution: 

issue: I would expect both `test1` and `test2` be `a` initially, and override to `b`, so when I getting the value in the app, I would get `b` for both, but `test1` is `a` 
solution: 

issue: ok ex11st doc profiles:  a, b        color:  red2nd docprofiles: a, b       color:blue3 rd doc profiles: a       port: 304th docprofiles: a       port:40then you should expect both profiles  color property  blue  and for profile a also a property port with value 40 
solution: 

issue: using `,` works, but now that's even more confusing, if I only have one document there (e.g. with `profiles: a & b`), it can loads properties correctly, which means it supports that syntex, but just ordering won't work. Also, if that only supports comma, how can I do complex expressions (with `|`, `!` etc.)? 
solution: 

issue: Hi all. I posted this Spring Web issue, but accidentally against INFRA: 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll I think @13669005514 might be a spammer... 
solution: It was a Spring Framework issue so I reported it there, but if I am not mistaken Spring Framework doesn't have a Gitter room so I also mentioned it here. However in JIRA I accidentally reported it against INFRA and unfortunately I don't seem to have the permission to fix that. I don't want to move it to GitHub, I think it should move from INFRA to another component. 

issue: yes yes sorry spelling error 
solution: 

issue: @akuma8 that's not a lambda, and judging by the error message no it's not supported 
solution: 

issue: @OrangeDog I'll not arguying the difference between method reference and lambda as method reference is a consequence of lambda. Why Spring Boot 2.1.x does not support this kind of configuration since Java 8 is required?

issue: @cortizqgithub there is a `WebFilter` contract available in Spring WebFlux (see https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/server/WebFilter.html). None of it depends on Servlet and it should be non-blocking, so you can't reuse existing Servlet filters for that. 
solution: 

issue: I originally tried setting up a sample service that is both the client and the server. Gave me a lot of headaches. Might as well use a barebones config client. Easier to troubleshoot that way @HeartThrobe

issue: Hello, I just updated my app from Spring Boot 1.5 to 2.1 and am running into an unusual error where a dependency of a dependency is not found. I'm getting the exception `NoClassDefFoundError: com/jayway/jsonpath/spi/mapper/JacksonMappingProvider`.I searched online for anyone having a similar issue and found this SO post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52909099/spring-2-0-0-migrate-gives-error-noclassdeffounderror-com-jayway-jsonpath-spHowever, their solution is to update to the latest version (2.4) but I'm already using that.  Can anyone point me in the right direction to solve this issue? 
solution: 

issue: @masquino You can, but you need something to recompile your code so that the changed class files are available. Running Gradle in continuous mode in another shell is one option. @jgarcia12_gitlab Are you sure that you are using 2.4? `com.jayway.jsonpath.spi.mapper.JacksonMappingProvider` exists in that version. If you are using 2.4, perhaps its jar file has been corrupted, preventing its classes from being loaded.

issue: @reneschroeder0000 Yes you can use it. It helps you manage all your exception in all your layers (data, service, controller). You also have to map your exception to HTTP code responses, mostly of the time it will be *BAD_REQUEST (400, for empty or null parameters)*, *NOT_FOUND (404, for empty or null value return)*, *INTERNAL_ERROR (500, for logic or other errors)*.

issue: Hi folks, I'm looking to deploy my app that talks with a few services via http periodically, and I'd like to have some metrics available. I'm wondering what my options are - I'm familiar with Spring Boot, but it seems like an overkill to have a full app just for the metrics. On the other hand I do want some healthcheck so I need a servlet...

solution: 

issue: Can I not write `@EndpointWebExtension` for actuator HealthEndpoint? When I do, I get conflict with `HealthEndpointWebExtension`, and if I try to override that bean with an identical one, it does not work as well...I did this;```@Component@RequiredArgsConstructor@EndpointWebExtension(endpoint = HealthEndpoint.class)public class HealthEndpointWebExtension { private final HealthEndpoint delegate; private final HealthStatusHttpMapper statusHttpMapper; @ReadOperation public WebEndpointResponse<Health> getHealth() {  Health health = delegate.health();  System.err.println("hey");   // I want to see this  return new WebEndpointResponse<>(health, statusHttpMapper.mapStatus(health.getStatus())); }}```with `spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true`, I can deploy the app, but my custom extension is not used at all... 
solution: 

issue: Yeah I suspected as much Nothing wrong at this point. What’s the method signature? Yes. What is the method signature that’s annotated with `@Transactional` ? uh? what do you expect that stuff to do exactly? You can’t run a transaction in separate threads

issue: anyone using micrometer with spring boot to implement custom metrics? Im using Counter which is interface from io.micrometer.core.instrument doest it have any method to set counter value to custome value? I see only increment() and increment(some value) but I dont see any reset counter function also is there a function to read the counter value? 
solution: 

issue: Yes. If the handler returns a `Mono`, I'd say streaming a single element doesn't really make sense. 
solution: 

issue: I know that someone may have asked about it before, but is there any elegant solution to work with webflux and spring cache manager? 
solution: 

issue: Sorry if this is stupid, but _where_ can I find the "spring boot dependency management"? Is it inside the gradle plugin or what actual code is there? ;) Sorry for sounding like a broken record, but mutliple docs make it sound like spring-boot provides additional logic/functionallity in this area but if you're saying it's not I trust you. 
solution: 

issue: It’s not 
solution: When various docs refer to `spring-boot-dependencies` is it simply this curated list of libs and versions? https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-dependencies/pom.xml. 

issue: Spring 5.2.0 upgraded to Jackson 2.10.0, but Boot 2.1.9 downgrades it back to 2.9.9.3 (not even 2.9.10) 
solution: 

issue: spring variables can be provided as `spring.datasource.url` in the .properties file or as SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL in an environment variable it depends on how containers are started whether they can see each other afaik I don't remember the details right now 
solution: 

issue: I know but in a production environement in a big organization, we don't have a single postgres for only this application, so I need to connect to a already existing container with postgreSQL, and be able to take the application container up/down without affecting db @konstantinblaesi 
solution: 

issue: @cisco92 true, what about this https://github.com/konstantinblaesi/spring-boot-docker-db-demo/tree/master/docker ? I assume it shouldn't matter as long as you create and use appropriate networks using raw docker commands However my knowledge on these is next to 0 :D can you paste commands used to* create the network* start the db container with this network I think then it shouldn't need a spring app to even test this. One could just use some random container and test tcp port connection using nmap against something like `db:5432` 
solution: 

issue: We are using systemd files for most of our docker containers already, so I have to follow the guidelines unfortunately. So no docker compose as of now I tried setting container IP, localhost, container name, local IP. Everything in the datasource url. Nothing works. Always get connection refused. But from PgAdmin it works. And that is not using Docker Compose either It's only from this custom spring boot application that I can't get it working 
solution: 

issue: So silly misstake.. test-net though but image should come last not first.. So annoyed now.. Been working on this issue all day.. lol 
solution: 

issue: I noticed when overrding ENTRYPOINT via `--entrypoint` during `docker run`. Docker just ignored my `--entrypoint` argument 
solution: Yes I didn't think it was that sensitive about position.. Thanks for your help anyway! :).

issue: 1.5.3 I'll try 1.6.0 yes that worked shouldn't it be in boot's pluginManagement? 
solution: 

issue: Both should be AsciidoctorJ 1.5.x so ideally wouldn't break 1.6.0 should work as that's what Boot 2.2's build uses 1.5.8 of the Maven Plugin should work too if you don't want to jump to a new minor

issue: @DhavalShewale I tried `/actuator/env` but it will show just anything that's in the config no matter if it's used or not. I basically added `foo=bar` to the application.properties and it showed up @DhavalShewale what do you mean by configprops? I tried this one, that didn't give any useful information either https://stackoverflow.com/a/37392817 
solution: 

issue:  
solution: Not by default, but you can get logback to do that. @OrangeDog Are you saying Spring Boot sends a mail to configured mail id in case of any failure in rest endpoint call. If yes, may I pls know the property which is used to set the notification mail id. 

issue: i have a controller that needs to consume a custom media type: ` application/vnd.oai.openapi+json;version=3.0`.  i add this to my consumes array, but when i try to make a request against the controller with that value in the Accepts header, i get back a `406 NOT_ACCEPTABLE` response. can somebody help me understand what other steps i need to take to support these media types? 
solution: @joshfix `consumes` means that the controller handler is expecting that type as a request body. You probably want `produces` on the `@GetMapping` annotation here instead. @bclozel that was it — i removed all `consumes` declarations from get mappings. in other areas, having a @GetMapping with consumes was producing a message: `"415 UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE \"Content type '' not supported\”` when i send a request with the accept header.  simply removing that consumes declaration fixed that issue as well.. 

issue: that's third party api i am calling it from my application using WebClient  and response is List of object they are sending in string  so i need to conusme it and map to my model i got this error org.springframework.web.reactive.function.unsupportedmediatypeexception: content type 'application/octet-stream' not supported for bodytype i putted header and accept as media type json but didnot worled worked* 
solution: 

issue: oh, then> . Spring Boot 2.2.0 isn’t outis a mistype, that's why I clarified :)Thanks in any case, your last message answers my question. 
solution: 

issue: mine are also looking okish - I guess the only solution I've right now is to try it on my own ... thanks anyways @OrangeDog 
solution: @springroll12 then that's because you haven't set it up right, not because you're also using `@PreAuthorize`. 

issue: Have you checked that `/v1/test` actually matches `/v**`?

issue: I want to use webflux with reactor netty,but my project that relies on spring-security-oauth2 , specifically with the class https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-oauth/blob/master/spring-security-oauth2/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/oauth2/provider/OAuth2Authentication.java,  to work with oauth2, but this project use the servlet api, and netty does not  support the servlet api. It's possible to use reactor netty with the  spring-security-oauth2 project? 
solution: 

issue: I solved the issue with RestTemplate (from Spring Boot 2.1.9.RELEASE) and jackson-dataformat-xml version 2.10.0: I used the dependencies/maven coordinates: jackson-core and jackson-databind versions 2.10.0 too. 
solution: 

issue: @alwyn thank you fr your reply - what is the required dependency for prometheus? 
solution: @joconte you should annotate it with @RequestParam or @PathVariable or whatever is applicable, and these annotations have a required param. 

issue: Hi guys, I have a problem with @NotNull annotation in a ```RestController``` , see me my example : ```JAVApublic ResponseEntity<MyObjectDTO> myMethod(@NotNull Integer someInteger) { // someInteger can be null here, even with @NotNull}```What do you guys think ? Is it normal ? Is it a bug with my Spring version ? 
solution: 

issue: ```JAVApublic ResponseEntity<MyObjectDTO> myMethod(@RequestParam @NotNull Integer someInteger) { // someInteger can be null here, even with @NotNull}```Still not working, I had it but in an interface generated by Swagger, here my method is ```@Override ``` 
solution: 

issue: oh, right, my bad 
solution: Actually, my param is present but it's NULL. If I call it like this : GET /myEndpoint It works, I have an exception because my param is not here But If I call it like this : GET /myEndPoint?someInteger=It doesn't throw any exception and within my method ```someInteger``` is null. (though, if you just implement an interface, it may be worth sharing the method signature  from the interface as well). 

issue: Question: I have an application.yml (main configuration) and for each "service" jar a configuration.yml file.  What is the best way to merge those configurations in each of the Jars with the main application.yml?

issue: I'm using `@PreAuthorize` on a `@RestController` and can successfully write SpEL that uses my custom-defined beans. But I want to be able to use the `HttpSession`. I can `@Autowired` the `HttpSession` into beans just fine. But if I use `httpSession` in the `@PreAuthorize` SpeL then I am told `No bean named 'httpSession'`. How can I access the `HttpSession` from within `@PreAuthorize` using SpEL?

issue: Is anyone seeing this warning after upgrading to Spring Boot 2.1.9? Warning: `class=org.springframework.data.convert.CustomConversions   Registering converter from class java.time.LocalDateTime to class org.joda.time.LocalDateTime as reading converter although it doesn't convert from a store-supported type! You might wanna check you annotation setup at the converter implementation.`Haven't quite figured out what the root cause of it is. I.e. if it's due to my dependency setup or not. Anyone have any insight on this? Thanks 
solution: 

issue: @jgarcia12_gitlab That warning is produced by Spring Data. You might want to ask in https://gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-data. 
solution: 

issue: that looks like some spring HATEOS stuff that *before* question is answered best by using git and looking at the changes you've made since it broke :D

issue: @odchan1_twitter this is ringing some bells but I forget the specific solution. I think the answer is on StackOverflow. 
solution: 

issue: @mplanchant Are you using SSL? It could be https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/18505. Tomcat 9.0.27 was released earlier this week and fixes the problem. You could override the `tomcat.version` property in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`. 
solution: 

issue: @jukkasi Sorry, ignore that. It was my fault. I mangled your sample. 
solution: 

issue: Not sure. So, my library can juse declare a `@Component` and it will be picked up by scanning? (I'm not sure how component scan works with stuff from starters) 
solution: 

issue: What does declare component mean in this context. Sorry for not really understanding. 
solution: 

issue: Perhaps you should take a step back and read a bit more about auto-configurations? 
solution: Something like this ```@Configurationpublic class GraphQLAutoconfiguration {    @Autowired    private GraphQLAnnotations graphqlAnnotations;    @Autowired GraphQLSchemaHolderConfigurer graphQLSchemaHolderConfigurer;    @ConditionalOnMissingBean    @Bean    GraphQLSchemaHolderConfigurer graphQLSchemaHolderConfigurer() {        return graphQLSchemaHolder -> {            graphQLSchemaHolder.initiate(                    event.getApplicationContext(),                    QLQuery.class,                    QLMutation.class,                    QLSubscription.class,                    QLQuery.class.getPackage().getName(),                    graphqlAnnotations);        };    }    @EventListener    public void updateGraphQLCustomTypes(ApplicationReadyEvent event)            throws IllegalAccessException, NoSuchMethodException, InstantiationException {        // User graphQLSchemaHolderConfigurer here    }}```. 

issue: Got it! Thanks.

solution: 

issue: If you’re using springfox they may need to change something to catch up @Stummi there’s something in the release notes about the move https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.2-Release-Notes#sample-projects-renamed-and-relocated @fmarot perhaps you shouldn’t be using a bean for that then? What do you need to execute that code?

issue: I'm trying to follow along with Trisha's Fully Reactive video and am getting stuck compiling on the kotlin service. Maven is giving me `Failed to execute goal org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-maven-plugin:1.3.50:compile (compile) on project my-service: Plugin not found: spring`. Yet adding the compilerPlugin does correct the ServiceApplication error in IntelliJ IDEA. Is this something that actually needs 2019.3 EAP to build properly? 
solution: 

issue: Oh that doesn't appear to do anything! 
solution: 

issue: Indeed, that’s why I am curious 
solution: I just set it to see if it would work. It at least doesn't break, which is what I wanted to test. @kenrachynski at this point I think it would be nice to share the project you have to see what could be wrong. @snicoll okay, https://github.com/kenrachynski/s1p-reactive-demo. 

issue: because that's not loaded without `@SpringBootTest` ? in this particular case, I'm using `@SpringBatchTest` - but that does not feel fully boot-ified ? 
solution: 

issue: `@SpringBootTest` loads the whole application, but you can still use all the other configuration to load only e.g. the logging config though I can't see which class you would import to do that... 
solution: 

issue: hi @Rajh, you can't just create the service, since the constructor dependencies will need to be mocked as well. @SpringUnitConfig + @MockBean is the way to go. Beware that maybe you have some service might require the whole app to be alive. 
solution: 

issue: No it’s not a bug in IJ What do you expect to happen exactly? [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/f2m3/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/f2m3/image.png) 
solution: 

issue: Yes the sample1 and sample2 are good suggestions There is no auto complete after `sample1` for example There should be suggestions for `time` and `name` [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/4MLR/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/4MLR/image.png) That's how it looks without the hints for the keys You are right it is not working at all for YAML 
solution: 

issue: @20Biere It looks like you have incompatible versions of json-path and json-smart of the classpath. Boot only has an opinion about json-path's version (2.4.0). What version of json-smart are you using? 
solution: 

issue: Only the inherited version of spring boot 2.2.0, wich is indeed the 2.4.0 . Here is the mvn dependency:tree : \- org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-rest:jar:2.2.0.RELEASE:compile    \- org.springframework.data:spring-data-rest-webmvc:jar:3.2.0.RELEASE:compile       \- org.springframework.data:spring-data-rest-core:jar:3.2.0.RELEASE:compile          \- org.springframework.hateoas:spring-hateoas:jar:1.0.0.RELEASE:compile             \- com.jayway.jsonpath:json-path:jar:2.4.0:compile In the finaly .war, only that version is present. 
solution: 

issue: On Spring 2.2.0, I'm getting a BeanCreationException when trying to use @MockBean to replace an existing configuration. It says that my bean "cannot have an existing value", but isn't that the whole point? 
solution: 

issue: "replace an existing configuration" -> "mock a bean which is injected in the @SpringBootApplication context". I was using a config properties class with constructor binding, but I've since remove it and used a normal @Configuration injection, and still getting the same error. 
solution: Exactly. I have a Bean provided in my application via @Configuration. I would like to mock this Bean in a SpringBootTest, but I'm getting the mentioned error that the bean "cannot have an existing value". I can't reproduce it with a smaller project, but I can try and get back to you.When debugging, it seems like TestContextManager.prepareTestInstance is being called twice, by separate executions of SpringExtension.postProcessInstance. This leads to MockitoTestExecutionListener being called twice, injecting the mock twice and throwing the exception..

I just upgraded to 0.2.1 (from 0.1) and a `bean<>` annotated with `@ConfigurationPropertiesBinding` that used to be picked up to convert configuration properties seems to no longer be picked up by the conversion service.

issue: Hey there. I am using the gradle spring boot plugin to build a "bootJar". In my dependencies there are two libraries with the same artifactId and version number, but different groupId. When they are packaged, both become `/BOOT-INF/lib/artifactId-version.jar`, resulting in a jar file containing the same filename twice. At runtime, only one of them is loaded into classpath and thus I get `NoClassDefFoundError`. 1. Is this intended behavior or should I open an issue for that? 2. Is there a way to change the name of the files before packaging to work-around that issue?

issue: i’ve scanned through the entire folder and i am 100% sure this is the only occurrence of this class anywhere i’ve tried a type search, resource search and a grep search. it is the only one there what do you mean? unless there’s a class in spring boot somewhere that’s named awsconfig as well? [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/2NpR/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/2NpR/image.png) i don’t know what else to tell you. It’s the only one 
solution: 

issue: Sorry but I doubt that. If your actual code is the first code snippet, something else must reference to it 
solution: ```@PropertySource("classpath:application-aws.properties")@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "aws")public class AWSConfig {}```.

issue: I don't seem to get Prometheus working in my boot app (kotlin + gradle, if this is relevant). I added spring-boot-starter-actuator and io.prometheus:simpleclient_common. /actuator/ works, but only exposes /health and /info, /actuator/prometheus is not listed and not exposed. Google and Documentation seems to fail me finding out what more I need to get it working. Any directions, please? 
solution: 

issue: @Stummi You need a dependency on Micrometer's micrometer-prometheus-registry module 
solution: @wilkinsona  just figured it out and was about writing it here :) thank you. Plus I need to enable web exposure of the prometheus endpoint explicitely:```management:  endpoints:    web:      exposure:        include: info, health, prometheus```. 

issue: as I was saying, the code previously worked on 2.1.7.RELEASE. So these classes don’t just magically duplicate themselves on our codebase 
solution: 

issue: i think i kind of understand what the dev was trying to do. in the documentation examples for @Import they used used:  ApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(Config1.class);But they were not sure how to do it in the context of spring-boot. I’m not sure if this code is the right way to do it.

solution: 

issue: hence my code earlier has ```@PropertySource("classpath:config1.properties”)``` 
solution: 

issue: I think I found what's causing that, but don't know why it actually does?So when there's a custom WebMvcConfigurationSupport exists in the context, the WebMvcConfigurer instance is instantiated, but not used (`addInterceptors`) not called. There's no any `@EnableWebMvc` annotation, an empty `WebMvcConfigurationSupport` class is enough to cause the issue. But I don't understand it actually causes this issue. @wilkinsona can you please shed some light on this? Thanks ```java@SpringBootApplication@RestControllerclass SpringBootApp {  @GetMapping("/{id}")  public String getId(@PathVariable Integer id) {    return "OK";  }}@Configurationclass WebConfig extends WebMvcConfigurationSupport {}```This minimalistic app is enough to reproduce the issue that a `WebMvcConfigurer` coming from an auto configuration not adding interceptors 
solution: 

issue: Yes. Each artifact in both Boot and Framework can be used with Jigsaw as automatic modules. The benefits are negligible at best though so we don't expect many people to bother and have hardly seen anyone do so. 
solution: 

issue: Consider I have a spring application with a minimal context. Can I, after it is considered running (all beans available for injection), attach/parent a new context created at runtime? ... and have it "just work"? :) 
solution: 

issue: Can we use/read from environment variables in property yaml when running spring not as a init.d service in Linux. So far looks like it's not picking environment variables. Any help? 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona locally it works fine with env only issue comes when launching on the ec2 box. I am launching there via init.d with a app specific user. Will double check if the env cars are visible to the boot init.d service/process Also works fine when running on docker or oc this way.. 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona I would like incoming messages on the SQS to be considered incoming requests to my controllers. In this way I can reuse any logic I might have in the controllers @OrangeDog If i use the methods in my Service layer i won't be able to reuse the logic from my controllers Ok fair enough. But if i call methods in my service layer directly, the SQS listener will be blocked until the call is completed I am using reactor. Are you saying the listener will automatically be asynchronous then?

issue: @aguiarluiz I raised this issue a few days ago. You might want to scroll back if it helps 
solution: 

issue: @OrangeDog Boot imports Spring Data's bom which controls the version for all Spring Data modules and keeps them in sync. You can either set a `<spring-data-releasetrain.version>` property or you could manually override the version of spring-data-redis by declaring your own dependency management for it @OrangeDog As long as you escape the space as needed for wherever you're specifying the property, I can't think why that wouldn't work 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona, Thank you for your answer and help. Basically, what I'm trying to achieve is an (application) migration from JBoss to SpringBoot.Today, I'm deploying an ear containing 4 wars, these are initiated in different contexts on JBoss and all loaded on the same port 8080 with different context access.This is why I'm looking into Parent - N Child relation on Spring Boot.Is this migration something that I can consider ? (I cannot load the 4 wars in the same context, as they have similar beans and it would cause a lot of issues) 
solution: 

issue: @dylmeadows yes, see https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/18828 and you should be using `spring.codec.max-in-memory-size`; it's pretty new so feel free to share your experience and what you were doing while hitting that limit. 
solution: 

issue: Just for reference, you can achieve the same manually:```ExchangeStrategies exchangeStrategies = ExchangeStrategies.builder()    .codecs(configurer -> configurer.defaultCodecs().maxInMemorySize(1024 * 10)).build();  WebClient webClient = WebClient.builder().exchangeStrategies(exchangeStrategies).build();``` 
solution: 

issue: in application.yaml it looks like it removed the space before the logger got configured ah, need `[]`

solution: 

issue: @kschlesselmann I'd run your test in the debugger, configure it to break on `NoClassDefFoundError`, and then look at the arguments being passed into `AnnotationsScanner`. @PatrickGotthard Spring Batch's skip listener?

Now there are some other threads, I can't get rid of an unread count of 2. I'm going to turn threads off again. 
solution: 

issue: Thanks. That looks like it's just the log messages rather than the stack trace. I'm interested in seeing where the `IllegalStateException` is thrown. Can you share the full stack trace for it please? It would also be useful to see the code for `DepositTransactionService`.

issue: I can't get it to work as a module either > Cannot load implementation hint 'org.sustainableroadfreight.CustomLayoutFactory' Is it possible to use a custom LayoutFactory from the current project, or does it need to be in a separate dependency? Even in a separate dependency I still get ComponentConfigurationException: Cannot load implementation hint 
solution: 

issue: yeah, you can't edit or delete threaded messages either @raviipawar https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-authentication-audit 
solution: 

issue: just migrated spring boot to v 2.2.0 and noticed that behaviour of the annotations scan has been changed. In our case we define @SpringBootApplication in the base abstract class and then multiple concrete applications extends this class (no annotations are defined in the concrete class). It works fine in the v 2.1.x, but in 2.2 attempt to run the app causes the error "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No auto-configuration attributes found. Is com.xxx.Application annotated with EnableAutoConfiguration"

solution: 

issue: @ptahchiev  You may want to contact the open source supporters and let them know you are receiving a warning, since it appears they have a Spring Extension.  I did some quick scanning of their GitHub repository and found one reference to setting the charset to UTF-8 but since I haven't used the library, that may or may not be the cause.

solution: 

issue: Are you constructing the service, or is Spring doing it (with `@MockBean`s and such)? why would you have to do that? or in other words, if you wanted different properties for each test, you'd still have to do that even if they used properties binding So why would you need a `@BeforeEach`? 
solution: 

issue: Spring is creating the service and im mocking via @MockBean 
solution: so either `@MockBean` the properties too, or `@Bean` a real one. 

issue: I don't ever use `@SpringJunitConfig`. I'll use a Boot annotation, or not involve Spring at all. 
solution: 

issue: But what if you don't need all the auto configuration stuff ? That was my first question, should I use @SpringJunitConfig or @SpringBootTest for UNIT testing my services 
solution: 

issue: There are other boot annotations (like `@RestClientTest`) that only configure specific things If it's a service that uses a `RestTemplate`, then `@RestClientTest` is probably the one to use. If it uses JPA then `@DataJpaTest`, etc. then `@MockBean` that service, as you have 
solution: 

issue: No, there's no reason to use `@SpringBootTest` for this

solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona To clarify: If I create my own health indicator that extends `HealthIndicator`,  I can't POST to `/actuator/health` to change the value of that indicator either? (obviously I would have to enable the details on the health endpoint)

solution: 

issue: hello, I have a strange issue.This exact code works in my RouterFunction, but fails in my ExceptionResolver:```request.bodyToMono(ResponseMessage.class)                .doOnError(r -> System.out.println(r.getMessage()))```The error from the resolver is `415 UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE "Content type 'application/xml' not supported for bodyType=ResponseMessage"` 
solution: 

issue: Curious if someone might be able to point me in the right direction.  I’m in the process of upgrading a large project to spring boot 2.2.1.  On startup, I’m seeing the message ```No CacheResolver specified, and no bean of type CacheManager found. Register a CacheManager bean or remove the @EnableCaching annotation from your configuration```My codebase contains no instance of `@EnableCaching`.  I’m not entirely sure where to start looking to figure out what’s triggering this.  i’ve excluded `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.cache.CacheAutoConfiguration` from auto config, but no luck. 
solution: 

issue: ok, I solved my own issue: add `        this.setMessageReaders(configurer.getReaders());` to the ExceptionResolver and don't use annotated controller

solution: 

issue: @ratikanta131 This starter has been introduced in Spring Boot 2.0.For the 1.5.x generation, you can take a look at: https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.3.x/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#websocket-stomp-handle-broker-relayThere's a section mentioning `org.projectreactor:reactor-net` and `io.netty:netty-all` - note the versions, as you can't use the latest reactor versions with that integration.Also worth noting: Spring Boot 1.5.x is EOL and security patches are not backported to that branch, and your application might be vulnerable to several CVEs (https://pivotal.io/security). Please upgrade at your earliest convenience.

issue: Any howto to run a fully FIPS compliant Spring Boot 2 application. Running inside a Docker container distroless-java Java 11 
solution: 

issue: @xenoterracide In the first instance at least, I think that should be suggested to the Framework team. There's nothing Boot-specific about a longer timeout being useful when debugging. They may consider changing the default or making it easier to configure it. If that doesn't work out then we could consider making it easier to configure in Boot somehow.

issue: @tusharchaudhari30 https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/labels/status%3A%20ideal-for-contribution When you have a `@MockBean` that's injected with `@Lazy`, the invocations you get from Mockito aren't very helpful (they're all `invoke0(Native Method)`). Is there anything to be done in Spring to improve it, or is it purely a Mockito issue? 
solution: 

issue: why is ribbon even in the logs, this resttemplate doesn't have the @loadbalance annotation 
solution: 

issue: @pmartycz We don't make a recommendation about annotation processor paths. Just do whatever works best for you. There's no property for the Spring Boot version as we don't want it to be configurable. I guess we could define the property and then not use it anywhere ourselves but I think that would lead to confusion about what it does.

But for a reason I ignore It doesn't work anymore, I didn't change anything in my configuration or spring, npm, node, version. I finally realized that I had to copy the build into the src/main/resource/static folder or public  to make it work. Does anybody faced the same problem and figured out why ?. 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona Hello Andy, you've helped me the last time and I am grateful. I have another question if you would please assist me, I need to have 2 differently configured RestTemplates (@Bean(proxiedRestTemplate) and noProxyRestTemplate). I cannot use RestTemplateCustomizer  because I don't need the configuration to be common for both of them.  And I wouldn't like to define my own RestTemplateBuilder beans, so my preferred approach would be to inject the auto-configured RestTemplateBuilder. My question is how can I inject the  auto-configured RestTemplateBuilder into each RestTemplate methods? 
solution: 

issue: i suppose the idea is to not specify defaults explicitly, and framework encourages you. i'm not from spring boot team so my guess may be wrong 
solution: 

issue: well, as a framework, it should allow broader possibilities because server authors can accomodate that. In fact, after i upgraded my app to SB 2.2.x, I saw those deprecated constants and removed those usages, but in our code we were using that to validate input request and my removal of those usages broke the client integration….I had to define my own constant using `MediaType` constructor with `UTF-8` to fix the issue. :) That’s why i feel it should not have been deprecated by Spring (as a framework)That said, may be my understanding is not enough.Thanks anyways for your time to explain :) 
solution: 

issue: @bclozel no I’m not overriding it, but the ```mvn dependency:tree``` output gives:``` From the poms I would expect 5.2.1.RELEASE though Ok, let me dig into it. @bclozel Found the issue. There was indeed a dependecy problem.  mvn dependency:tree and mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose didn’t show the dependency override, probably because it is not reliable in maven 3 
solution:

issue: @jan-krakora I'd recommend using Spring Security's `@WithMockUser` @SubhamAshish There isn't really enough information in your question. I would guess that the request has been sent to the wrong URI, but that's only a guess. Adding an [MCVE](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) will make it more likely that someone is able to help you. @Chr3is I can't as I wasn't involved in the decision. You'd have to ask the Framework team. @bclozel might know. @wites342 Didn't you already ask this on GitHub? https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/19320. Posting the same question without considering the suggestion you've already been given just runs the risk of wasting the time of the next person who tries to help. 
solution: 

issue: how can I propagate state from my routerFunction to downstream methods? 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona can you give me a/the reason for supporting application/\*+json in the Jackson2JsonDecode but not application/*+xml in the Jaxb2XmlDecoder (out of the box without extra configuration)? I think they should behave the same way..

solution: 

issue: @bvn13 unfortunately I'm using it in descendant of `AbstractRoutePredicateFactory` where `GATEWAY_ORIGINAL_REQUEST_URL_ATTR` is not present :(

Currently I'm manipulating my objects myself to achieve this, but was wondering if I could utilize ObjectMapper converter ?  I can register a converter and get it to work for all endpoints, but not sure how to go about only using a converter for a specific RestController.

solution: 

issue: @Sebourg Does your entity object use the tobuider annotation of the "lombok plugin"? I also encountered the same error, just comment out the "toBuilder" annotation. Looking at the source code, I found that adding the "toBuilder" annotation will generate a full parameter construction method that affects the process of instantiating mybatis objects. My English is not good. I use Google Translate. There may be many errors.

solution: 

issue: `ZonedDateTime` does store timezone info... perhaps you're thinking of `OffsetDateTime`? `Instant` will always work to unambiguously represent the moment that something happened, which is usually why you're tracking created/updated

issue: Hello everyone, after upgrading to spring boot 2.2 I'm getting these errors when the server comes up: "Bean 'rvice' of type [org.springframework.cloud.openfeign.FeignClientFactoryBean] is not eligible for getting processed by all BeanPostProcessors (for example: not eligible for auto-proxying)" Does anyone knows what's the problem here? This is just an example, the errors are not related just to FeignClientFactoryBean 
solution: 

issue: hello all! Could you explain to me a mechanism of resolving application.(properties|yaml) when application is divided into modules (java 8, gradle). My issue is that main (runnable) module misses all properties from module it depends. 
solution: 

issue: sadly we can't ask for an opinion because our posts get deleted ;( 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll my use case is: several core modules and several applications. Core modules are intended to be independent to others. They must encapsulate processing properties. 
solution: 

issue: a module that participates in an application should not provide application-level configuration IMO but each case can be different. Using `@PropertySource` is not really recommended either, see the doc. I’ve already shared a link to a way to tune the environment 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll Could you explain your opinion of not to use `@PropertySource`? Seems I overlooked it... 
solution: 

issue: Hi Guys, I am having difficulty dealing with getting application.properties variables into my java application. I have used `@ConfigurationProperties` and `@Values` and both seem to not work 
solution: 

issue: what would you like to see happening instead? If you have an idea to improve, feel free to raise a framework issue 
solution: 

issue: Hi All, I have this two methods annotated with @Cacheable and with different cacheNames on my class:```    @Override    @Cacheable(cacheNames = "templateTypeCache")    public TemplateType getTemplateType(Integer sponsorId) {        return TempleteType.CNAB;    }    @Override    @Cacheable(cacheNames = "CNABTemplateCache")    public TemplateCNAB getCNABTemplate(Integer sponsorId) {        return new TemplateCNAB();     }```But when I call getCNABTemplate I got the class cast error because the return is a TemplateType, my question is: I need two differents keys even using differents cacheNames? 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll I was able to create a test that reproduces the problem and put it here: https://github.com/zsyphon/cam-testI am running it in eclipse Thank you for any insight you can bring I had this working with integration endpoints and APIs returned data. Thank you again! 
solution: I have been running it as a spring boot application. Then go to http://localhost:8080/ it will not respond.. 

issue: I get ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED when I visit http://localhost:8080 
solution: I never finished the aws config. Maybe it's the db settings that were lef tin. 

issue: found what I was looking for`springdoc.pathsToMatch` 
solution: 

issue: hello, I have a webflux application that I am performance testing now.  After a large scenario, I see that the service performance much much worse if I don't restart it, before running another test.  What could be the issue? 
solution: 

issue: @obarat it's really hard to tell. You should profile your app and collect proper metrics (not only throughput, but latency percentiles), get data from the server VM and the client MV, precisely define your scenario, etc.What makes you think it's the memory? Are you seeing large GC pauses? 
solution: 

issue: Presently I have no version logged when my app starts up. `Starting ServerKt on myapp-746cf7975f-cbv4j with PID 1 (/app/classes started by root in /)` 
solution: 

issue: Interesting, the docs on spring.io show the same thing. https://spring.io/guides/topicals/spring-boot-docker `2018-11-07 09:41:06.390  INFO 1 --- [main] hello.Application: Starting Application on 1989fb9a00a4 with PID 1 (/workspace/app/BOOT-INF/classes started by pack in /workspace/app)` 
solution: 

issue: so I'm using `spring-boot-starter-log4j2` and it seems that after packing the Jar it doesn't allow the use of custom spring converters like `%clr` etc for some reason 
solution: 

issue: Got a question regarding @ConfigurationProperties binding, i am using spring consul package and i have a path in consul which consists of many keys.I can see that the way the binder works is it fetches key by key recursively, what i need to implement in order to make this mechanism work in batch ? 
solution: 

issue: I feel that the role of controller is getting smaller and smaller. Now 5g is coming, load balancing and microservices are becoming more popular. Why not add another layer of expansion 
solution: 

issue: Hi, is it possible in a yml file to set a map key with a variable ?Exemple```  app:    my-map:      - ${myKey}: ${myValue}```?

solution: 

issue: Hi. Are there tutorials to extend the Thymeleaf StandardDialect? Reason is, I find myself regulary using  `th:field="*{someField}" id="someField" th:data-value-old="*{someField}"`, and I'd like to do this with a single call. 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona actually it is an exisiting spring boot project which has code having @scheduled  annotation. And we have some active node(serving traffic) and passive node(the node not serving traffic).Any node can be switched from passive to active and vise versa.So the requirement was to execute the schedular only in active node only.

issue: Im interested in ApplicationEnvironmentPreparedEvent event. But the event is not getting calledThis is the code:```@Componentpublic class TestEvent implements ApplicationListener<ApplicationEnvironmentPreparedEvent> {    @Override    public void onApplicationEvent(ApplicationEnvironmentPreparedEvent event) {        System.out.println("TestEvent.onApplicationEvent");    }}```

issue: Hey,It seems like the `WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer` doesn't play nice with `spring.main.lazy-initialization=true` in Spring Boot 2.2. The clients get stuck on the `CONNECT`-phase, and does not retrieve a `CONNECTED` message.I have added `@Lazy(false)` in our `WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer` bean, but it didn't do any difference. Does anyone have any pointers?

solution: 

issue: and admin-login should be post method which accepts username and password in the body and you would authenticate and send a sessionID or JWT token as response or 401 if authentication error

In order to do retries with a *feign* client, I've been following this documentation: [spring-cloud-feign-overriding-defaults](https://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/spring-cloud.html#spring-cloud-feign-overriding-defaults).

Am I missing something? I will appreciate so much any help!

issue: I don't suppose there's a way to have a fallback static error page for when your normal error page fails? I imagine it depends on the container, if it's supported at all 
solution: 

issue: Hi, in spring-boot-dependencies version 2.2.2 the following incompatible libraries are being managed: org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-util:9.4.24.v2191120 and org.glassfish.jersey.containers:jersey-container-jetty-http:2.29.1The incompatibility was fixed in jersey version 2.30 (see https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jersey/commit/1504174ace92ff8cbeb13f5b588edd598466e18b)Is this the right channel to report the issue? According to the github issue template I shouldn't raise an issue in github to upgrade a library.

solution: 

issue: when I want to do A.allofB.size  where allofB is the manytomany field that link A to B (through a join table) I get in infinite recursion I've dealt with infinite recursion when serializing my data (Json), but in that case I am not serializing anything… (and the two manytomany sides are LAZY) If I remove the manytomany field on the class B, then I can run that (but I cannot find all the A linked to an object B from an object of type B) I can't find a way to have the both sides of that manytomany relation (and I am NOT using serialization here) I am wondering if it could be an issue with kotlin data classes that may want to hash the objects anyway (as I am using sets) (and that seem to be the case as turning them all into normal classes "solve" the issue)

solution: 

issue: And as I wrote that google gave me a hit on using ServerWebExchangeDecorator + ServerHttpRequestDecorator. I think overriding getBody and using Flux#cache should be sufficient 
solution: 

issue: .. or not. Bah! 
solution: 

issue: @michaelmcfadyen i'm down the path of using the @RestController annotation. I've gotten as far as using a request decorator to hook into the getBody flux and calculating the hmac once it's read. Problem now is that I can't find a good way to emit an error. I emit an ServerWebInputException but this is logged as an error by the invocation handler around my controller - i'm having the body injected as a parameter and it is at this point it is read. 
solution: 

issue: sorry, not in a position to share the code. What I can say is that with a HandlerFilterFunction you get access to ServerRequest which has methods for extracting the body. HandlerFilterFunction need to be applied in the router though so I don't believe they are compatible with using annotation based webflux endpoints 
solution: 

issue: should it not happen that use applicationContext in a Bean to use its method "getBean()"?Why it is so complex, for example, to implement the ApplicationContextAware. why is it still not achieved that use @Autowired ApplicationContext context to get a context? Thanks...

issue: you can do that Altough getting a bean programmatically is not really a mainstream use case IMO (or getting a reference to the `ApplicationContext` for that matter)

issue: @asgarj You can decide what has precedence by the position of the property source within the environment. The first source with a particular property wins. 
solution: 

issue: @asgarj Given the complexity of your arrangement, it's starting to sound like you would be better off implementing your own condition. @asgarj I don't think I understand your problem then. Earlier you talked about a property source per endpoint, but now you're saying the problem is a single endpoint.

issue: I want to run the same junit5 tests class 3 times, each time with a context property set to a different value. Is there a nice way to do that? `@ParameterizedTest` is only method not class level, and whilst I could use `@DirtiesContext(AFTER_EACH_TEST_METHOD)`to recreate the context that is quite expensive to do per test and I can't see how to set the context property before the context is initialized. 
solution: 

issue: I see - thank you for clarifying. Have you read https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#webflux-server-choice? Ah, sorry, lose the question mark on the end. Can't edit the post now

issue: infinispan has its own starter, are you using that? 
solution: This does only work, if using `spring.cache.type=infinispan`. But even then, Hibernate will create an own instance of DefaultCacheManager and then later, the starter will create a second instance.. 

issue: Thank you very much, taking time to write this down. I will give it a try on a fresh project. In fact, this test behaves as I would expect it. 
solution: it won’t pass if you create the `CacheManager` yousrself. It would be sufficient to me, if I could declare the configuration.xml by myself. And I can check the ordering of CacheAutoconfiguration and HibernateJpaAutoConfiguration as it behaves in the other order in my application..

issue: Hi all, been having a problem the last week with some flux web socket code. I posted the question with the problematic code on StackOverflow with no luck (so far) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60030795/spring-webflux-websocket-closing-before-onerrorresume-logic-can-be-completed. Basically, I have a series of steps where one can return a Mono.error if an exception is thrown (wrapped in a try/catch where the catch returns a Mono.error). For some reason, the socket is closed before the onErrorResume can happen and therefore the latter stages are never called. Has anyone else experienced this before?

solution: 

issue: @Asamsig You could try excluding the security auto-configuration using the `exclude` attribute on `@SpringBootApplication`. I'm not sure if that will have the desired effect as I'm not sure how much, if at all, `spring-cloud-starter-oauth2` relies upon what Boot's security auto-configuration does. 
solution: 

issue: Not sure if this is a core java behavior or a spring-boot question but we have an issue with an async using the main thread when this async thread is called via an intermediate method. example: ```@FeignClient(name = "test", url = "http://localhost:8001/test/actuator/health")public interface BankProxy { @GetMapping(value = "/") public String cashIn();}```Then a service class:```@Service@Slf4jpublic class Component1 {    @Autowired    protected BankProxy proxy;          public void intermediateMethod(int i) {        log.info("{} intermediateMethod()", i);        callProxy(i);    }        @Async("adapterThreadExecutor")    public void callProxy(int i) {        String resp = proxy.cashIn();        log.info("{} callProxy() {}", i, resp);    }}```Main class```@EnableFeignClients@EnableAsync@SpringBootApplicationpublic class ExperimentsApplication {    @Autowired    Component1 proxy;     public static void main(String[] args) {  SpringApplication.run(ExperimentsApplication.class, args); }  @Bean public CommandLineRunner run () {     return args -> {         for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {//             proxy.callProxy();             proxy.intermediateMethod(i);         }     }; }   @Bean(name="adapterThreadExecutor")     public Executor asyncOutgoingAdapterExecutor() {         ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();         executor.setCorePoolSize(20);         executor.setMaxPoolSize(1000);         executor.setWaitForTasksToCompleteOnShutdown(true);         executor.setThreadNamePrefix("Async-Adapter-");         return executor;     } }```when i use proxy.callProxy() in the loop the thread for adapterThreadExecutor is created as expected. However, when I use intermediateMethod() it uses the main thread ([nio-8000-exec-“) 
solution: 

issue: Don't use a name that Boot already uses, or you'll get confused. 
solution: well I don't think boot is using anything at the moment (no spring boot context is loaded, just the jsf context). and my goal is to have other spring autowired components read from this environment (in other spring boot projects where the same autowired components are included, they automagically read from the auto-loaded application.yml). 

issue: hm.. I have reviewed and rechecked all escaped characters myself. And it was my mistake. There is no an issue anymore. Sorry about disturbing you. 
solution: 

issue: @kousen - I wouldn't say `RestTemplate` is deprecated yet, and really, for `TestRestTemplate`, all you're using it for is to send http requests to your app under test, so why not use it? An http request is an http request.  If `TestRestTemplate` fits your needs, then I'd say you're good.  If you're testing something that `TestRestTemplate` doesn't support (i.e. a streaming request or something more reactive) that would be something that forces you to use `WebTestClient` in my opinion. - disclaimer, I'm just an individual spring user, and those are just my opinions.

issue: @iheb090 I'm not aware of such an announcement. Could you point me to the source? 
solution: 

issue: @iheb090 Ask your friend where he got that from and I can check things for you. On the top of my head I don't remember such an announcement, but maybe it's been deprecated in a specific project, for a specific use? Without more context, I can't help. 
solution: 

issue: Ok , And if i need to think of  scenario where lets say :1st microservice calls another 2nd microservice, And 2nd microservice gets down the moment has been called , in Anycase the Payload i dont want to miss and has to send the same to another available microservice . and it has to be instant , USe should not find any glitch or slowness .. 
solution: 

issue: And that's why micro-services are usually recommended against unless absolutely necessary, they are hard to implement correctly.Now, Spring Cloud provides great tools to make microservice architect's and developer's life easier, but one still needs to understand what problems need solving if you go Micro-Service way. 
solution: 

issue: Hi spring-boot team. I'm looking for a way to register a custom metrics `JCacheCacheMeterBinderProvider` to override the default one coming from `CacheMeterBinderProvidersConfiguration`. The use case is the fact that apache ignite provides an api for accessing metrics available from the cache manager directly, whereas the default jsr107 metrics uses the mbean server. I can't seem to find an easy way currently to replace the default implementation. 
solution: 

issue: @OrangeDog ah, that seems like it might be useful. In looking at my DTO class though, I realized that I changed it from having properties with types, to just one property (a HashMap) with getters/setters that read/write from the hashmap. Since there are now no typed properties for the serializer to read, could that also be an issue? Maybe it's just a matter of specifying the types on each getter with @JacksonSerialize ? 
solution: 

issue: @mehrentreich Improving auto-configuration of multiple DataSources is on our radar (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/15732) but not something that we have any immediate plans for. In the meantime, using a `BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor` is what I would recommend. By that point, the environment should have been populated with the contents of `application.yml`. While you can't reference a `@ConfigurationProperties` bean in a `BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor`, you can use the `Binder` API to bind the environment to your DataSource configuration POJO in a handful of lines of code. 
solution: 

issue: @cortizqgithub yes, documented here:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Code-Style 
solution: some projects, like Spring Boot, also have automated code formatting and style validation: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#code-conventions-and-housekeeping. 

issue: So you're manually calling `new RestTemplate()` in your configuration, not using the Boot autoconfiguration? 
solution: 

issue: it's a "library" - it's not using Spring dependency injection per se basically accepts a ` ClientHttpRequestFactory` (to muck around with mTLS) and wraps that in a `new RestTemplateBuilder().requestFactory(() -> requestFactory).build());` for convenience I added a constructor which accepts a `RestTemplate` for tests, so I can use that with `MockRestServiceServer` but now it turns out that message-converters are ordered differently ... so yeah 
solution: 

issue: You said the converters are duplicated, that would seem to be the actual issue. 
solution: 

issue: including 2x `StringHttpMessageConverter`, 2x `MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter` and 2x `MappingJackson2XmlHttpMessageConverter` (if you have jackson2 & jackson-xml on the classpath) but more importantly, they are sorted differently compared to  `new RestTemplateBuilder().build()` and that's what triggered my issue: if `jackson-dataformat-xml` is on the classpath, my app started sending xml data instead of json and I could not reproduce that with my tests, because my tests use the dependency-injected message converters 
solution: 

issue: @springroll12 what about https://www.baeldung.com/spring-http-logging ? still wondering if manual `new RestTemplate().getConverters()` vs  spring-boot-context-provided `ObjectProvider<HttpMessageConverters>` ordering is an issue or not especially because its effect triggers weird behaviour with `jackson-dataformat-xml` on the classpath or not

I was sent here by Stéphane Nicoll after trying 2.3.0 docker features  https://spring.io/blog/2020/01/27/creating-docker-images-with-spring-boot-2-3-0-m1I have an issue where I am setting the port to 8089, but when I run the image it starts on 8080. https://github.com/jfbourner/springboot-docker.

solution: 

issue: @bitsofinfo Tomcat uses JUL. Have you got something set up to bridge Java Util Logging into SLF4J and Logback? 
solution: 

issue: @mehrentreich This is not my original intention. My real thought is how to achieve the same function as the configuration file after I migrate the configuration of application.yml to the database. Similar to how I configured spring.session.store-type = jdbc in the database, how can I make it work the same as he configured in the configuration file. 
solution: 

issue: I tried to use a custom bean to complete the automatic configuration, but I feel that I have not solved it from the root cause, because I need to customize the configuration for each property in the springboot configuration 
solution: 

issue: > My resources directory needs to be emptyAn odd requirement. Especially as once compiled there's no distinction. 
solution: 

issue: > @kedar-joshi `log4j-jul` only does anything if you configure the `java.util.logging.manager` system property to `org.apache.logging.log4j.jul.LogManager`. Doing so has the benefit of allowing debug level JUL logging to be routed into Log4j2. `jul-to-slf4j` allows info and higher level logging to be routed into Log4j2 without any additional configuration.@wilkinsona Ah, that's neat. Thank you for the explanation. 
solution: Hi,I have a question regarding spring boot starters and autoconfigure project structure-I want to add shared  functionalities between services, for example a module for error handling that will contain ControllerAdvice with exception handlers, custom exceptions, error codes and error structure class My goal is developer friendly modules for rapid micro services development - all services will add my-company-error-handling-spring-boot-starter as a dependency so they can focus on business logic.I need to choose the module structure,The official documentation says-"You may combine the auto-configuration code and the dependency management in a single module if you do not need to separate those two concerns."  I saw that every open source starter has at least 3 maven projects- starter, autoconfigure and parent. Can you tell me the advantage for this structure instead of a single project?Is it over engineering for my use case?Thanks,Nir. 

issue: this https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/5036 seems to be a similar issue. the solution is not clear to me 
solution: 

issue: @thackel You can't tell Boot's Maven Plugin to do that, but you can still do it. One way is described in [this issue comment](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/6626#issuecomment-291507210). @Su-s this isn't really the right place for general Java questions. Stack Overflow and the `java` tag is a better place. That said, you should be able to do it using the replace method on String. 
solution: 

issue: @nnanda2016 that configuration for json serializer should work out of the box, shouldn't it? I'm just wondering if autoconfiguration depends on WebMvc or not. I'm not using web-mvc in my project. 
solution: 

issue: Following the last question, the springboot configuration migration database was successful, but a problem occurred when using it. In the case of configuring multiple data sources, the spring integrated session uses jdbc to store the session. Spring.session.store-type = jdbc The data source is not what I want, how should I specify a specific data source. 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys.  I'm trying to conditionally create beans based on the value of a @ConfigurationProperty bean (of which at compile-time the property path is unknown).  Using Condition's to check the Configuration beans value does not work, as the ConfigurationProperties are applied too late in the app contexts lifecycle.  Is there an alternative method?

solution: 

issue: ohh, thanks @snicoll  - For now I will not be able to move the auto-config class outside of component scanning purview. This is part of a library that multiple clients use with component scanning in their services. Is there a work I can implement ? Multiple auto-configurations (along with the current `ServiceAutoConfiguration`) are in `com.company.library.autoconfigure` package and everyone uses `@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.company")` in their service code.

solution: 

issue: > you should not reference a static unless it’s from a static methodDoesn't sound like a rule that you want. Instance methods referencing static fields is a really common thing. Otherwise you can't have sane constants or singletons. Though in your specific case, I don't see why you need a static. Just make your class directly `ApplicationContextAware` instead of using `ApplicationContextProvider`

issue: @nnanda2016 It sounds like you've used `{id}` more than once in a predicate. That's only an educated guess based on the error message. I'd need to see your router configuration to say more. @chad_d_stud_twitter I don't believe anything's changed. I can't help more than that without some more information about the failure 
solution: 

issue: @nnanda2016 i suppose `RoutePredicates.PUT_WITH_ID_RP.or(RoutePredicates.DELETE_BY_ID_RP)` returns new predicate with `{id}` used twice. i guess workaround with renaming each `{id}` with something like `{getId}` etc will fix your issue the reasone for error might be that handler won't be able to identify which `{id}` matched thus exception is thrown at parse time

issue: It's not working for that, actually i am hadling the validation using custom exception internally and using @digit it would ignore the validation for "deck":"hello" -- not working"deck":"1" -- working and validate"deck":1 -- correctString numeric values would work 
solution: 

issue: Your deck field is an Integer so I imagine you'd get a deserialization error before it even hits your validation when passing in "hello" Is that what is happening? 
solution: 

issue: For a more direct translation, you can just use `@ConfigurationProperties` to bind a `Map<String, String>` (or `<String, URI>`) can't you? Ah, but you've have to rearrange the property names (I'm assume they're supposed to be `service.availability.svc`, `service.booking.svc` instead of all the same?)

issue: Hello, what is the best way to invoke messaging/websocket handler? For example if I have endpoint like this ```@MessageMapping("/devices/new")@SendTo("/topic/devices")public Device createDevice(final CreateDeviceMessage message) {...}```Is there some option to invoke it not directly by calling `someController.createDevice(message)`? I was thinking that it's possible with `MessageSendingOperations` like `template.convertAndSend("/app/devices/new", CreateDeviceMessage.builder().macAddress(createDeviceRequest.getMac()).build());` but it's not working this way. I just want to call some messaging (local) handlers from rest. 
solution: 

issue: 1) not require it to be an integer, so binding succeeds2) use `Validator` directly and throw a `ValidationException` 
solution: Validation failures as part of Spring request binding are going to throw `BindException` anyway.

issue: @scottfrederick I just realized it choked on my qualifiers 
solution: I see that I can create a RepositoryRestConfigurer, but is there a way to have several?. Can I not have two beans of the same type with different names and autowire them both into the same constructor with @Qualifier?. I have set the names with @Bean(name = "foo") and @Bean(name = "bar"). 

issue: Ofcourse I had a typo

solution: 

issue: There is no 2.2.6.RELEASE in maven central for this artifact: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.security.oauth.boot/spring-security-oauth2-autoconfigureShould I log that against the oauth github? Is there a way to expedite getting the artifact up there? 
solution: 

issue: @steveninchicago_twitter look at the artifact. It’s not part of Spring Boot but Spring Security. 
solution: @seyidnaali roles in json is an object and not an array. i can imagine your payload contains single role, maybe something like that will work```"roles":[{"role":"user"}]```and don't use trailing commas after last item in object/list. 

issue: Or perhaps thats the expected as in old times, and for some reason I have a bug that does not parse

solution: 

issue: Since nobody replied, i have created an issue in the spring security github page: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/8245Any help would be greatly appreciated :) bumps too! Hey guys, i have created a new ticket for the double vary headers when cors filter is enabled, if anyone wants to take a look. Turns out that this is not an issue with spring security, but spring framework itself!https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/24829 
solution: 

issue: I also created issue since I have no idea how to fix my error: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/20749 
solution: 

issue: this is what I ended up with but I don't really like it a lot:```    @Bean    public SpringLiquibase springLiquibase(LiquibaseProperties liquibaseProperties,                                           DataSourceProperties dataSourceProperties,                                           ObjectProvider<DataSource> dataSource,                                           @LiquibaseDataSource ObjectProvider<DataSource> liquibaseDataSource) {        LiquibaseAutoConfiguration.LiquibaseConfiguration autoConfiguration = new LiquibaseAutoConfiguration.LiquibaseConfiguration(liquibaseProperties);        return autoConfiguration.liquibase(dataSourceProperties, dataSource, liquibaseDataSource);    }``` 
solution: 

issue: It's largely designed as all-or-nothing unfortunately. I have previously resorted to `setAccessible(true)` on some complex autoconfig to avoid copy-pasting it all. 
solution: you mean, _reflection_ ??. 

issue: A potential fix would be to only inject the `CorsInterceptor` in the `AbstractHandlerMapping` if the handler extends `CorsConfigurationSource` AND it provides a non-null `CorsConfiguration` too.Right now this check is being done in `AbstractHandlerMapping#hasCorsConfigurationSource` Or another way would be to only add the `Vary` headers in the `DefaultCorsProcessor#processRequest` if they aren't already present. 
solution: 

issue: That was almost exactly my case too, but for JDBC/JPA. I think there's some dev work ongoing for multiple db support. 
solution: 

issue: but maybe they have something in the works 
solution: 

issue: not 100% sure but I think there should be a way You get the headers before you write to stream ? so my filesFacade.getDocument gets headers and stream from Azure

issue: Hello.Any idea how to get the  `ttl` of cache while testing ? 
solution: 

issue: Hello, is there any guide which shows the configuration of an OAuth2 Resource Server with the most recent spring boot version? I am absolutely confused about all the dependencies. I have used `spring-security-oauth2-autoconfigure` in the past but I have seen, during a security audit, that some jackson-asl dependencies have security issues => The reason is that it uses an old oauth2 dependency but in a more recent version of the oauth2 library the affected dependency has been exchanged. But at github of the autoconfig lib it's stated that the library is in maintenance mode (see "This project is in maintainence mode. Spring’s new support for OAuth is built directly into Spring Security"), so I wanted to check to setup it correctly. When I am importing `spring-security-oauth2` (version 2.4.0-RELEASE) all the used classes like `@EnableResourceServer`are deprecated but I have no clue why ;) But this library is deprecated itself, see "The Spring Security OAuth project is deprecated. The latest OAuth 2.0 support is provided by Spring Security. See the OAuth 2.0 Migration Guide for further details.". So I guess this one is also the wrong one ;) 
solution: 

issue: If I read https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/wiki/OAuth-2.0-Migration-Guide correctly to setup Oauth2 I can't use `@EnableResourceServer` and `ResourceServerConfigurerAdapter` anymore. 
solution: 

issue: Cheers @wilkinsona I appreciate that 
solution: 

issue: I see that spring supports building an oauth2 authorization server here https://docs.spring.io/spring-security-oauth2-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-security-oauth2-authorization-server.html since that uses the nimbus oauth2 + openid connect sdk under the hood according to https://spring.io/blog/2017/05/11/spring-security-5-0-0-m1 I was wondering if spring has some support for building open id connect servers too ?

solution: 

issue: No, either will work. It's worth checking that the SnakeYAML jar hasn't been corrupted. If it works when you run your app normally (rather than in a test), then that can't be the problem. @jorgemoralespou Thank you. We've opened (and fixed) https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/20858. 
solution: 

issue: The app definitely works, so I don't suspect the jar being corrupt. OK, at least you've confirmed that yml should work, so I'll continue working on it. Thanks 
solution: 

issue: @watery it will be because it's relative to the dispatcher

solution: 

issue: > @murali474 a simple solution is use an shared redis or memcached instance, or other cache service. Another solution is your aplication `A`  use some kind of message broker, like rabbitmq that listen events from other services and do the cache evict when a specific event was triggered. Maybe theres a better solution, with spring cloud related services, or something like that.Currently i am using hazelcast as cache provider

However when I call zuul-gateway-server:<port>/my-service/{uri} in the browser, it prompts me for username and password which makes sense. However, even after entering correct credentials, it keeps me asking for username and password. No matter how many times I enter my credentials, I can't log in the server. However, when I call my-service-ip:<port>/{uri} I am successfully able to login to the server. Can someone help me with this issue?

solution: 

issue: @darek1024 that exception is not really related to the question I think. It’s ASM telling you you’ve not enabled the preview language features. Spring Boot itself hasn’t support for records yet (i.e. for Configuration properties). The framework team had a look but I am not sure where things stands. Make sure for a start you’ve enabled preview features and that you’re using the latest Spring Boot version.

solution: 

issue: Thank you Allen, I will try that 
solution: Also, there is the context events which might give you more control. Like if you have a application event listener looking for the `ContextStartedEvent` and does whatever work instead of having this happen in the `@Bean` method. Just another possibility.

issue: My comment above about enforcing JSR-303 validations in a `@DataJpaTest` does work as expected when I replace it with the `@SpringBootTest` annotation. So I guess this is as designed?

Can anyone direct me to some documentation or suggest what to try? 
solution: 

issue: You cannot have multiple `@SpringBootConfiguration`. What is unclear? Because it's for identifying the application root configuration There can't be more that one 
solution: 

issue: why ^ that's not what I am observing. I have a @SpringBootApplication at the root and three @SpringBootConfigurations in the modules and the application is still working. That's why I am asking. I don't see why there can't be an application root and multiple module roots. The source for this is this article https://reflectoring.io/testing-verticals-and-layers-spring-boot/ 
solution: 

issue: https://docs.spring.io/spring-javaconfig/docs/1.0.0.m3/reference/html/modularizing-configurations.html there are many ways to define modules 
solution: 

issue: That spring-javaconfig is a pre-release milestone from 2008. Java modules were released in 2017. 
solution: 

issue: well we dont use java modules and guess what we still have modules. and I don't want to discuss module theory. My question was about the SpringBootConfiguration annotation. 
solution: 

issue: I don’t think this is caused by that, it’s just offering an option that has no configuration by default Are you sure that you only changed the Spring Boot version and nothing else? The error message looks a bit odd 
solution: 

issue: you need all those dependencies to reproduces a component scan problem? It looks like a framework issue to me. I would try first with `2.2.7.BUILD-SNAPSHOT` to see if that wasn’t fixed yet 
solution: 

issue: still fails with the snapshot can you raise a spring framework issue? This setup is quite complicated so we’d need to debug the sample

solution: 

issue: ArtemisEmbeddedServerConfiguration is not listed in spring.factories, so that's the reason I think. What confuses me is that it's shown in the configuration report but it isn't applied 
solution: 

issue: @konstantinblaesi it might be that versions are treated as semver, in such case pre-release versions according to semver have "lower value" then first release, so 4.0.0-RC3 < 4.0.0 in fact not semver, but looks like similar principle: https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1212/core/MAVEN/maven_version.htm#MAVEN400

solution: 

issue: @kjq it looks like your client is connecting, sending a request and then disconnecting (exiting the test suite shuts down the VM?). So it's consistent to see that disconnect message on the server side. 
solution: 

issue: @aberkecz you may want to use some message broker, and connect all servers to it or similar approach something like rabbitmq, or even pubsub mechanism of redis @aberkecz i'm just talking about keeping all servers in sync, it does not affect your client-server connection 
solution: 

issue: What "root" application.yml? 
solution: 

issue: w.r.t. `ClassNotFoundException: org.springframework.boot.system.ApplicationPidFileWriter`, that `ApplicationPidFileWriter` class moved from `org.springframework.boot.system` in 1.5 to `org.springframework.boot.context` in 2.0. so it definitely looks like something’s not matching up version-wise. 
solution: dependency management is hard.

solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona  I thought too that bean definition registry post-processor was the right one, but when looking up in the registry for the bean who provides the map, I can't find any. Maybe I'm not using the correct way of hooking the post-processor. See this repo: https://github.com/lucasvc/spring-boot-provide-runtime-beans-before-conditionThanks for taking a look :) @wilkinsona Yes, I knew about getting the bean itself, but I can't find **neither the bean definition**. Is this expected?> the map is purely dynamic bean configurationRight, but the way of reading the configuration is on legacy library and I'm little bit _tied_ to it. But it has some sense. 
solution: 

issue: Hmmm, yep!!! Oh god if this is the problem... @srempfer That seems to be the problem!! THANK YOU!So now that I'm looking at this `spring.factories` file, I've got one more class that can't be found anymore - `org.springframework.boot.system.EmbeddedServerPortFileWriter`. Any idea where that one ended up? I'm Googling, but all my hits are for that class having a package change from 1.4 -> 1.5 
solution: 

issue: Either way you have some serious code smell in there. I would think about how you can refactor this so you: 1) eliminate calls to statics to ensure your objects are as pure as possible and 2) avoid polluting the service interface with dependencies. I would instead introduce a new interface that uses the factory pattern to safely construct the underlying service. 
solution: 

issue: no what I tried isn't possible hmmm one sec again... nope when decoding, the library creates a new codec and I lose my reference to objectMapper

solution: 

issue: @OrangeDog  Unfortunatly, I have wrtten a fair amount of code with the Builder and of course, it wasn't until now that I needed injection for this component. Reading the docs for the BeanFactory  and Abstract Factory is when it dawned on me that my design was flawed. I am using the builder to enter credentials and other data that would be specific to a session, NOT shared via a static builder

issue: Hi everyone,I am deploying my spring boot REST api to AWS ec2. Just want to ask, is the embedded tomcat capable enough to handles the load or I need to install tomcat ? I am pretty new to this stuff 
solution: 

issue: This is not happening all the time. We have 40 VMs(8 core , 27GB Ram), most of the time issue is with 2-5 VMs. A restart will solve the problem 
solution: 

issue: yeah, tell me about it. it's been a year since i've noticed this problem i figured they would've fixed it by now 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona Unless you have my problem with modules... 
solution: @eyalringort I've replied to your comments on SO; unfortunately, it's hard to figure out what's happening here without more information.. 

issue: `spring.datasource.tomcat.testOnBorrow=true spring.datasource.tomcat.validationQuery=SELECT 1`Would these properties work for a custom datasource or should I write`mydatasource.tomcat.testOnBorrow=true mydatasource.tomcat.validationQuery=SELECT 1` 
solution: 

issue: No. The best is subjective and depends on the preferences and experience of your team(s). If anyone claims that any framework or library is objectively the best, then usually the only reasonable conclusion to draw from that is either they're not competent enough to judge the competition or not honest.

solution: 

issue: It's now triggered by a `DataSourceSchemaCreatedEvent` in addition to the `DataSourceInitializerInvoker`? Oh, I've probably ended up with two invokers on the same ds due to hacking about with multiple sources 
solution: 

issue: That sounds fine. By fairly minimal I just mean cutting out anything that's superfluous. 
solution: So the first change is that the autoconfig `DataSourceInitializerInvokers` no longer backs off, which is fine because I can just remove my one that duplicated it. The issue is with my second one.. But are you even interested, given that it's not a public class?. Or perhaps, not that it used to back off, but now one instance triggers both instances to run. 

issue: fair enough I may be mistaken that it worked on RC1, but I don't think I am it 100% changed since 2.2.x That's the code above. I reflected the constructor. 
solution: 

issue: No, it's not being injected anywhere. Only mentioned by name in a `@DependsOn` in a separate config where the JPA beans are.

solution: can I log all APIs uri with context path in spring boot ?. 

issue: do what? @s1apped you will probably see that the response is a `forward:`. You need to then make the error request with the same request state to see the final output. 
solution: 

issue: that's what I also assumed, thanks 
solution: I’d assume that `s2i-java` is building an image with the entire fat jar contents in one layer. that’s actually what the Paketo buildpacks will do also, unless the fat jar is built with the Boot layering information in it (i.e. a `layers.idx` file). any other tooling would have know about `layers.idx` to provide the same layering benefit.. 

issue: I am using Kotlin but I'm not sure if its related 
solution: 

issue: I'm not sure that's the best course of action. Documenting everything that Spring Boot itself does not do is essentially a never-ending task. I'll open an issue instead to see if there's something we can do about the inconsistency.

issue: Hey  I have a spring boot webflux (2.2.7) app running on k8s. It will from time to time receive 10-100 rest call at once from a different system. I know that this is not ideal but not easy to change. Each job will take around 1-2 seconds to complete. These jobs seem to saturate the worker threads so that the k8s health check can't get processed in time and times out. k8s thinks the app is dead and will kill and reboot it. Any suggestions? I already increased the health check timeout and failure threshold but this only fixes it "most of the time". Changing the port with management.server.port did not change anything. Is there a way to give priority to the health check somehow?

issue: What changed in Spring Boot 2.3.0 that these lines are no longer working?error: package javax.validation does not existimport javax.validation.Valid; all my config with @Validated are not working Oh, it's now a separate starter. -_- 
solution: 

issue: Yes, but there's a lot of code in there and I want to do exactly that plus one extra thing. I can't even compose with it because the constructor isn't accessible Unless there's something I'm missing? What does that mean? Why can't it have a public constructor, so you can make an instance of it? The first one I looked at was `StringToPeriodConverter`, which is (it's also not final) So there's no way to get an instance of a converter in another converter bean? Then I get a recursive dependency 
solution: (yes I know that caps it at 24h). 

issue: create an issue? Wait You should try to parse your format and then bail if you can't then whatever converter that’s next in the chain will be invoked you don’t need to call ours Look at the javadoc? 
solution: 

issue: which bit? I'm guessing it wasn't working before because I was letting it throw `DateTimeParseException` instead of `IllegalArgumentException` No, that doesn't work either. How is the next in chain supposed to work? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I have flow where I need (Optionally) request params, how can I set the request scope as optional?Should I set it as prototype scope and use Optional<HttpServletRequest> or there is another way to avoid the:org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'scopedTarget.myBean': Scope 'request' is not active for the current thread;

issue: @AlexCzar If you run it in a mode where you set the web application type to none, it should shut itself down automatically as there won't be any threads running to keep the JVM alive. @DoraRajappan Sorry, no idea based on what you've described. 
solution: 

issue: Sounds like something's changed the value of the header before it reaches the endpoint or the client isn't sending it properly. I can't think what might be doing that. If I were in your situation, I'd want to try to narrow down where the problem's occurring. I'd probably do that by debugging the server and check the headers that are received.

issue: @snicoll - in the POM for the project I add this:```<dependency>            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>            <artifactId>spring-boot-autoconfigure-processor</artifactId>            <optional>true</optional>        </dependency>```After building the package I am looking in the output folder under META-INF but just see my spring.factories file. 
solution: 

issue: And what's the gradle task that generates it exactly? the docs mention `compileJava` and `processResources` (and their dependency), so is it their output is ignored unless you package the output? 
solution: I don’t know how you’ve configured your build but it’s an anotation processor like any other annotation processor. So the doc of your build system (Gradle it seems) should tell you that. 

issue: I'm playing around with the really nice new Docker build-image goal in The Spring Boot plugin. However, I need to recompile code on the fly in my project and thus need a JDK (not JRE) based image. Is it possible to make this happen via configuration? Thank you!

issue: Hello guys :) i'm having a bit of a trouble here to configure the logs on my spring boot app :/ i upgraded from java 8 to 11 recently and made some cleanup on the log4j dependencies as i only use logback (and as springboot have those dependencies). I use rollingFile to log on a daily basis, this works fine so i guess no issue with my logback.xml . The issue is that when i have an error in my app it doesn't log to this file. I realized that in my console, the error doesn't have the same pattern as the others logs so i think my issue is that another logger is logging the errors, this is why logback can't log them in the log file ...Any clue on how to debug this ? I can't figure how to debug this.I can send you the logback.xml file or a sample of the logs to check the differences between the different messages.Any help appreciated :) 
solution: 

issue: I think it's the undertow default logger ( jboss logger) that logs me this error ... But i can't find how to force the undertow logger to be my logback instance 
solution: 

issue: If I have a controller like this:```javapublic class DemoController {  public ResponseEntity<Demo> sampleDemo(@Validated @Pattern(regexp = "...") @PathVariable String name) {  }}```and pass an invalid `name` in the request, the validation error returns `sampleDemo.arg0` as the path of the parameter that has failed validation, wrapped in a ConstraintViolationException.Is there a way to get a more user-friendly path (e.g. sampleDemo.name)?Ideally I want to write an exception handler that for all validation errors of this type in my app to return a response like this:```json{  "location" : "header | path | query | body",  "element"  : "<property path>"}```For example:```json{  "location": "path",  "element" : "name"}```But `arg0`, `arg1`, etc. are not making implementing that clean and straightforward.

issue: Hello everyone, I am migrating a microservice from Spring Boot 1.5 to 2.2.7, and I am facing an issue with my logger. My application starts perfectly fine; I can execute REST calls, actuator gives healthy status, but the application stops logging during startup. The last thing it logs is: "Initialized JPA EntityManagerFactory for persistence unit 'default'". I have a logback XML file that writes log output to Console & File, but both stop logging at the exact moment so it's not a console issue or anything in that direction. System.out.print & System.out.error does work. I've tried enabling debug mode, but it doesn't really tell me anything. There's no stack trace or error. Can anyone push me in the right direction? 
solution: 

issue: What is your use-case then? How dynamic is it? You can only define one bean definition with one `@Bean` method That can create multiple instances if it's not a singleton bean. 
solution: The use-case is that spring-boot binds all `MeterBinder`s on the classpath to the `MeterRegistry` automatically. So you can create your `MeterBinder`s in the `@Bean` annotated class.. Now I want to create multiple instances of the same `MeterBinder` with different tags in the auto-configuration in a spring-boot library..

issue: Can i request spring boot to give an instance of ModelMapper without specific bean creation in @Configuration file? If we have a modelmapper dependency then why can't we just autowire modelmapper in the spring boot? 
solution: @sagarikamraj Such things normally come from a spring boot starter. If there's none for ModelMapper you have to create the bean yourself..

Eventually the call fails/times out with org.springframework.web.client.ResourceAccessException: I/O error on POST request for "XXX": Unexpected end of file from server; nested exception is java.net.SocketException: Unexpected end of file from server 
solution: 

issue: Well, it provides management access and monitoring for your web application. If you need that, then actuator is the easiest way to achieve this. If not, then you don’t need to use it. What it offers is explained in the documentation

solution: 

issue: [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/RMuQ/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot/RMuQ/image.png) I'm confused about the default error handling behavior for JSON parsing errors for a REST service. various blog posts seem to claim that the default behavior includes the jackson exception message (e.g. https://www.toptal.com/java/spring-boot-rest-api-error-handling), however, that's not the behavior I'm seeing in a simple hello world project (spring-boot 2.3.1). I just end up with an empty `"message"` :/ has this perhaps changed in newer versions, or is something misconfigured in my end? oh, that's quite recent, that explains a lot. :) thanks for the swift response!

solution: 

issue: Hi. I just lost half of my hair debugging a problem for an hour :-). Not sure if it's a known problem in Spring or if I just found a new issue:```@Configurationpublic class SomeConfig {    @Bean(name = "other")    SomeOtherBean foo() {        System.out.println("constructing SomeOtherBean");        return new SomeOtherBean();    }    @Bean(name = "foo")    SomeBean foo(@Qualifier("other") SomeOtherBean other) {        System.out.println("constructing SomeBean");        return new SomeBean(other);    }}```With the above configuration class, SomeOtherBean is constructed twice, and SomeBean is never constructed. Why? Because the two methods have the same name. If you rename the second method to `bar`, everything is constructed once, as expected. Should I submit an issue? (Admittedly, using the same method name is not a good idea. I just happened to have done it by accident)

It worked fine with Camel 2 do you know how to set the SSLContext for Camel 3? When I debug I see the SSLContext used by the http component is the default one and not the one I configured. 
solution: 

issue: with Camel 2 I had the following in my HttpConfigurer configureHttpClient method:         Protocol.registerProtocol("https", new Protocol("https", socketFactory, 443)); it seems that API changed with Camel 3 and is not supported any more 
solution: 

issue: @jhartotr You might find some Camel users here, but I'm sure there are better places to ask Camel questions as this room is focussed on Spring Boot. They have their own room on Gitter for example: https://gitter.im/apache/apache-camel. @pulse00 When you say custom constrain validators, are you talking about bean validation (JSR-303)? If so, you can't safely make a DB call during validation as it may block.

solution: 

issue: We are not using Spring integration. 
solution: 

issue: But when you do that you loose all dependency information, that’s why you should use real maven dependencies. When you do mvn install it’s put in your local mvn repo and you can get it locally from there using maven. BTW: when the jar is a spring boot jar, then this won’t work as you might expect, because this is an executable jar. To have a regular jar as well, you need to configure your build to do so. (google knows how to configure it to do that)

issue: @pcornelissen we have actuator on a different port, but we're using the servlet stack 
solution: 

issue: Ah, ok. Thanks @wilkinsona I’ll check if maybe my spring boot version is too old 
solution: 

issue: I'd expect the component that starts the thread to keep a reference to it. When it's being asked to stop, it can then call `join()` on the thread. 
solution: 

issue: Can you please explain me why, in option 2, the timeout is not being applied? 
solution: Because you've blocked the thread by calling thread.join(). 

issue: Hi all. Can anybody help me how to include a lib that is using spring-parent older that the parent of my project 
solution: 

issue: I did it but some conflicts show up that I can not resolve. Once I use the same version of parent as the lib is using the issue is resolved but this not what I want 
solution: 

issue: Hmm,the party seems to have been a bit premature. When I start locally then the actuator is bound to 8080, this works when I start the service and in tests. But when I start it in the VM in our dev environment the port is not bound and actuator is using the regular port again. Very confusing. I can’t figure out it behaves differently :-( 
solution: 

issue: In my service the actuator config is in the property file located in the jar itself. When I run it locally, actuator is bound to the correct port, but when I run the same app in the dev environment, the actuator port is not bound and the andpoints are accessible on the public port. I even tried to copy the actuator properties to the property file outside of the service (loaded via the --spring.config.additional-location parameter) Is there an easy way to debug why actuator is not grabbing its own port? 
solution: 

issue: @DeviRoopshekar I don’t believe that Finchley is compatible with Spring Boot 2.3. You should upgrade to Spring Cloud Hoxton. @SauriBabu I’m not familiar with Gateway’s retry capabilities. You might have more joy asking in https://gitter.im/spring-cloud/spring-cloud. 
solution: 

issue: @asgarj Is there a `FactoryBean` involved? If so, I would guess that it's https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/20665 that's caused the change in behaviour.

solution: 

issue: I totally agree your suggestion. I will try to use 2 approach and decide the best solution with my sourcecode. 
solution: 

issue: It is literally impossible to automatically solve "all compile time error" though. And no real developer needs a separate tool to add semicolons and close brackets to their code It's just cementing the inability to write basic Java 
solution: 

issue: of course it isn't possible to solve all the compile time errors automatically but my milestone for AutoCompiler is to solve minimal errors such as missing bracket missing symbols and other .

issue: Hi. I am playing with layered jar mode in Spring Boot 2.3 and I really don't like that I have to build a fatjar, push it to an intermediate docker image, execute it there to get extracted layout and then copy to the final container.Is there a possibility to get extracted layered layout during gradle build process instead of fatjar  before building docker image, so that I can just `COPY` from gradle build directory instead of an intermediate docker image? 
solution: 

issue: Will try that. Thanks! 
solution: May someone can point me to the right direction regarding springboot and logging. I can define a lot of stuff in application.yaml : logging.*** including log-rotation etc. _but_ I have also my own logback-spring.xml and if I defined only loglevel in my logback-spring.xml (no appender etc.) then simply nothing happens in the console or in a logfile etc.Currently I have to define a console-appender _and_ a file-append (incl. rolling) so that I see something ... What are the best practises here?```<include resource="/org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/base.xml"/>``` doesn't help either..

issue: Hi all.  I'm trying to get a custom spring cloud gateway filter to work which aborts the filter chain based on some condition.  I have custom gateway filters for other stuff running, but can't for the life of me find out how to abort the filter chain.  Basically I want to return 401. I'm using the current stable spring cloud gateway.  Also, I'm very new to WebFlux.

solution: 

issue: @Sidharth-Bansal That output shows that your application failed to run but does not show why it failed. Hopefully, that information will have been output earlier on. Is there anything about a failure above the output that you have shared? 
solution: 

issue: @Sidharth-Bansal  It is not clear why the application does not start. The reason for this is given a few lines above or can be seen in the log file. Share the error messages here. Surely you've already studied this? https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-oauth2/  -- Sorry, english is not my language.

issue: @bukajsytlos If it works as a regular jar and fails when built as a Docker image, it sounds like the ordering of the classpath has changed. That shouldn’t happen. Can you please open a Spring Boot issue with a small sample that reproduces the problem so that we can investigate? 
solution: 

issue: Hi Team, I have developed a sample Spring boot Rest API and SSL enabled with keystores. I have deployed that war file in Websphere. So my question is, SSL still work or not ? 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona I tried to create a reproducer, and I've find out that it works in 2.3.1 but fails in 2.3.0. Not sure if I should create issue for others to find? 
solution: 

issue: I've set it as findBylang and it works. Thanks for the information I've got an error named javax.persistence.EntityNotFoundException: do you mind if I trouble you for it? entity class found but variable not found 
solution: 

issue: No. If you are using an application server, you'll have to use its configuration to setup SSL. I see you've already asked this in https://gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-security. That's the better place for Spring Security-specific questions. Please don't cross-post in the future as you may end up wasting someone's time as they try to help you in one place, not realising your question has already been answered in the other. Glad to hear you've got it working. If it's already fixed in 2.3.1, there's no need to open an issue. Thanks though. 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona hmmm, they could probably indeed 
solution: exclude it from your build file (pom or .gradle) and add it manually by hand. 

issue: That could work, thanks for the suggestion, I just thought there might be a way to not build the fat jar at all, since it gets discarded anyways.

issue: Hi all ... I'm facing a little problem like described here (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37058691/encoded-comma-in-url-is-read-as-list-in-spring) - binding a list of Strings to a rest-endpoint where it must be possible to use "," in the String.  Anyone here have an idea on that? Currently we are using a workaround via ```@InitBinderpublic void initBinder(final WebDataBinder binder) {    // use the custom convert which does NOT convert 'A,B' to two entries.    binder.registerCustomEditor(List.class, new CustomCollectionEditor(ArrayList.class) {      @Override      protected Object convertElement(final Object element) {        // FIXME sometimes we get the value not URL decoded ... no idea why, does not happen in tests        if (element instanceof String) {          final String value = (String) element;          if (value.indexOf('%') > -1) {            // should not happen..            LOGGER.info("Must manually decode input value '{}', why?", value);            try {              return URLDecoder.decode(value, "UTF-8");            } catch (final UnsupportedEncodingException e) {              LOGGER.error("Cannot decode '{}' with UTF-8", value, e);            }          }        }        return super.convertElement(element);      }    });  }```.... but this looks not right because its a global "fix". Any ideas guys? 
solution: 

issue: @toidi There's no `spring.r2dbc.initialization-mode` property in Spring Boot. There may have been one in the experimental project, I can't remember. Please see [this section of the documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.3.1.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-initialize-a-database-using-r2dbc) for details of how to initialise the database when using R2DBC. It sounds to me like you will need to parse the request parameters yourself so that you can apply your own knowledge of the domain to figure out when values should be separated. You could just do that in the controller to avoid it applying globally. I've just double-checked and I can't reproduce the behaviour you've described I've got `@RequestParam("param") List<String> param` and `param.forEach(System.out::println);`. When I access `localhost:8080?param=1&param=2&param=3,4'` it outputs the following: ```123,4```

solution: @tgioer you do aren’t you. The only thing that code does is “builder.build()”. If you want to take control over this, you can still inject `TaskSchedulerBuilder` and set it or expose it as a bean.. 

issue: Thank you @snicoll [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/544f4753db8155e6700cefb5/peTq/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/544f4753db8155e6700cefb5/peTq/image.png) I'm going to create it manually, okay? It looks perfect, too. 
solution: 

issue: How are you providing the credentials to the CLI? I would guess the problem is that the bootstrap context doesn't see the properties provided by the dynamic property source as they're only added to the main application context.

solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona thank you. I found it. 
solution: @narraboss  yes, you'll have to configure two DataSource beans for it. it's somewhat tricky,  imho.. 

issue: You can add an entry to `spring.factories` to include any configuration in a test slice You could either list it under the `org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.servlet.WebMvcTest` key or the `org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.servlet.AutoConfigureWebMvc` key. The latter will work as the former is meta-annotated with `@AutoConfigureWebMvc`. "it doesn't work" doesn't tell us much, unfortunately. It should work, otherwise I would not have suggested it. Without knowing what you've tried it's impossible to know why it didn't work for you. 
solution: 

issue: It doesn't work 
solution:

issue: Thanks @wilkinsona! Glad to know I can ask for help here!My question might be specific to the combo of Spring Boot/Maven/VScode. I'm following the instructions in this VScode tutorial: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-webapp. It is based on this tutorial by Spring Boot: https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-spring-bootI'm at the step of building the project. I open the Application.java file in complete/bin/src and press F5 to build. I get this error every time:"A project with the name spring-boot already exists.The supplied phased action failed with an exception.Duplicate root element spring-boot"The 'Maven' tab of VScode's explorer does show two projects titled "spring-boot". I think this is because there is also a maven project in the "initial" folder.

solution: You could have your own Gradle plugin that depends upon and applies a particular version of Spring Boot's Gradle plugin.. 

issue: From the spring-boot-plugin, yes. I use `io.spring.dependency-management` too but since that's a separate plugin and doesn't control the version of Spring Boot in the microservices, it's OK Do you think I might be able to omit `id 'org.springframework.boot' version "2.3.2.RELEASE"` altogether in my microservices and just rely on the Spring Boot version provided by my shared library? I've never tried this actually I like the platform module idea. I believe it has a minimum Gradle version requirement but that's not an issue. Actually we are using some of the tasks like `bootJar`, `bootRun` etc. So completely removing the plugin may not be an option 
solution: 

issue: Not saying this is a more correct way or not, but if you added `springboot-starter-web` and `springboot-starter-actuator`, you'd get production ready endpoints for application monitoring (health, environment, metrics, etc., the list goes on), and since there would be a web context to the project, spring boot will keep it alive until you terminate it? 
solution: 

issue: if i disable ws-security endpoint is found and I do not see any error regarding decryption or etc issue 
solution: 

issue: Sorry, I don't understand what you mean. `spring.factories` lists auto-configurations that `@EnableAutoConfiguration` will import. It doesn't use `@EnableAutoConfiguration`. There should be nothing stopping you from using the `exclude` attribute of your single `@EnableAutoConfiguration` (or `@SpringBootApplication`) annotation to exclude the auto-configurations that you do not want. 
solution: 

issue: Yeah, I get that. It has no effect on whether or not config can be excluded though. 
solution: 

issue: alla working as expected when use 2.1.5.RELEASE but 2.2.4.RELEASE getting Beancreationeception: error creating bean with name ‘entityManagergactory’ defined in class path source [org/spring framework/boot/autoconfigure/orm/jpa/hibernatejpaconfiguration.class]

issue: with saml2login on the latest spring boot, can someone tell me how to set the issuer (entity id)?  I keep getting Error: app_not_configured_for_user from Google when attempting to auth and I think that's my issue, but I can seem to find any documentation on it. 
solution: 

issue: Trying to find any documentation on SpringBoot 2's saml2 implementation is pretty difficult, all I seem to get is result from spring-security-saml.  Is there a listing of the configuration properties from the SpringBoot saml2 (saml2login), I can't see to find that either.

issue: Hello, recently upgraded from 2.2.x to 2.3.2.. getting error : 
solution: 

issue: JSR310DateTimeDeserializerBase.acceptCaseInsensitiveValues. 2.3.2 uses Jackson 2.11.1 whereas jjwt uses 2.9.6. Using maven, is maven exclusions the only solution to resolve this issue at this point, since  latest jjwt version is 0.9.1 that still uses jackson-databind version 2.9.6 Still getting the same error even after exclusion and I tried to set Jackson mapper case insensitive properties to true. Anything I can do to resolve this issue? The application is deployed in weblogic 12.2.3 c . 
solution: 

issue: hello,after upgrade of spring boot from 2.1 to 2.2 memory usage has been increased, especially when I compare heap dumps "before" and "after" I see these new entries```org.springframework.boot.loader.jar.JarFile                    17,966,750 (9.5%) 3,305,882,000 B (22.2%)java.util.WeakHashMap$Entry[]                                  17,966,882 (9.5%) 2,731,093,552 B (18.3%)java.util.WeakHashMap                                          17,966,856 (9.5%) 1,293,613,632 B (8.7%)java.lang.ref.Finalizer                                        17,974,927 (9.5%) 1,150,395,328 B (7.7%)java.util.zip.ZipFile$CleanableResource$FinalizableResource    17,966,752 (9.5%) 1,006,138,112 B (6.7%)java.util.Collections$SetFromMap                            17,970,833 (9.5%) 575,066,656 B (3.9%)java.util.WeakHashMap$KeySet                                17,966,761 (9.5%) 431,202,264 B (2.9%)java.lang.ref.ReferenceQueue$Lock                           17,976,934 (9.5%) 287,630,944 B (1.9%)```first that came to my mind is that I am using SPI in the project, so maybe this is related, but then on 2.1 this problem was not visible.. were there any changes in newer boot related to jars loading? or what else could be the reason of such an aggressive heap usage?

solution: There's some information in the contributing guidelines about getting the code setup in your IDE: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#working-with-the-code. From there I'd find a problem that you want to solve and then step through the code in the debugger to see what's happening..

solution: 

issue: Was there a regression on `2.3.2` regarding integration tests? before upgrading to `2.3.2` i had a main test class and many subclasses to test different controllers only one application context would boot, run all test classes and shutdown had to use a fixed port in this specific project, which has never been a problema before. but now that i upgraded to `2.3.2`, an application context is started for every subclass instead of reutilizing the one from the parent class and i get port already in use exceptions or too many clients for the database (limiting max connections resolved this issue, but fixed port is still an issue) is this already tracked? 
solution: 

issue: @jorgebsa Sorry for the inconvenience. Assuming that you're using `@MockBean` or `@SpyBean` this is already fixed in 2.3.3 snapshots. Please give it a try and let us know if it doesn't fix your problem. 
solution: 

issue: When using validation annotations like `@NotNull`, `@NotBlank`, ... you can override the error message via `messages.properties` by adding for example:```NotNull=Please enter a value for the fieldNotBlank.user.firstName=Please enter a first name```For a `LocalDate` that is annotated with `@DateTimeFormat()`, you need to use `typeMismatch=....` in `messages.properties`. Is there anybody that knows where this is documented? 
solution: 

issue: I also wonder about:```Size.user.firstName=The first name should be between {2} and {1} characters.```Where can I find the official documentation that `{2}` is the min value and `{1}` is the max value from the `@Size` annotation?

solution: 

issue: The rules of Java apply: you have declared a field, and it's not initialized anywhere, so its value is null. If you try calling a method on fileProcessor, you'll get a NullPointerException, since it is null. So you must initialize it somehow. If it's just a regular class, you probably need to call its constructor. If it's a Spring Bean, then it should be injected into your controller. And the cleanest way to do that is to pass it as argument to the constructor, and of course initialize the field with the argument. Hi Iszubelle. You need to clarify your question: we can't possibly know how to implement a method without knowing anything about what it's supposed to do. Note that what you posted is not valid Java syntax.

The lifecycle for servlet-related beans doesn't work as needed: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/df944c635423ad7d9281ffbbd6ebba11ea598594/spring-boot-project/spring-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/builder/SpringApplicationBuilder.java#L193-L196 
solution: 

issue: Sorry if this is an improper chat to ask about this, however, I have an issue with OpenAPI. I'm using `org.springdoc:springdoc-openapi-webflux-ui`, and I have two endpoint definitions that differ by parameter usage, e.g. one is annotated `@GetMapping(value = "/v1/api", params = "ip")`, and the other  -- `@GetMapping(value = "/v1/session-token", params = "!ip")` (hence the second endpoint gets invoked when the `ip` parameter isn't passed into the http query). I marked both of these methods with `@Operation`, however, the generated ui shows only one endpoint (the first one, to be exact, e.g. that one that does have the parameter). I tried including `operationId` in the `@Operation` definition, but it doesn't help. I included this parameter in all my endpoint definitions, but the UI lists only one endpoint. Does anyone know whether it's a known issue, or it's possible to update this somehow? The reason I can't just make one endpoint with the logic enclosed is that I want one endpoint to be secured (via `@PreAuth`), while the other is not secured, and I want that to be visible on the API definition page.

issue: Thank you for your response @bclozel . How to test my API on my localhost to see if it is using TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3? 
solution: 

issue: @kpcsuh just noticed that you said it was only failing for large requests. This looks a bit inconsistent. In my opinion, if it was 100% a TLS compatibility problem, the client wouldn't be able to establish a connection. Maybe this is not linked with TLS after all? It's hard to figure out the problem without any concrete element (like a stacktrace and log messages) @Zaker1 mockmvc is meant to test your Controller and its error handling. You're trying here to assert the response sent by the Spring Boot error handling infrastructure; this infra involves the servlet container so it's hard to reproduce 100% without a running servlet container. On the other hand, you're testing here the Spring Boot infrastructure, not your own code. See https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/20345

issue: I want to test the behavior around the configuration of the spring "DefaultFirewall" and I believe this needs to be tested with a real servlet container like jetty or tomcat. I currently use MockMVC for my endpoint test. What would be the next logic step to test with a real servlet container? Ilike the MockMVC syntax etc so happy to keep using it. I would want to avoid setting up external tests here (as in spinning up a separate process and performing actual http queries with another framework) 
solution: 

issue: @snicoll, Thanks. I will check it. 
solution: You'll have to stop using `MockMvc` if you want to test against a real servlet container. Instead, you can use (Test)RestTemplate or WebTestClient and configure your `@SpringBootTest` to start the embedded web server on a defined or random port..

Please see https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/23003#issuecomment-676536611 for details. That was rejected as it's not easy with Maven. We could consider something Gradle-specific, however, by looking for project dependencies. Please open an issue and we'll see what we can do. I can't see the connection with Spring MVC. That looks like a Spring Data problem to me. You'll find more Spring Data expertise in https://gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-data.

The offending code is  public Mono<GCPSignUpUserResponse> signUp(String email, String password, String tenantId) throws GCPIdentityServiceException {  final Mono<GCPSignUpUserResponse> response = webClient.post()    .uri(uriBuilder -> uriBuilder      .path(GCP_IDENTITY_SUFFIX_ACCOUNT)      .queryParam("key", settings.getApiKey())      .build())    .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)    .bodyValue(GCPSignUpUserRequest.builder()      .email(email)      .password(password)      .tenantId(tenantId)      .returnSecureToken(true)      .build())    .exchange()    .flatMap(clientResponse -> {     if (clientResponse.statusCode().isError())      return clientResponse.bodyToMono(GCPIdentityErrorResponse.class).flatMap(details -> Mono.error(new GCPIdentityServiceException(details)));     else      return clientResponse.bodyToMono(GCPSignUpUserResponse.class);    });  return response; }}. Anyone a clue where I'm going wrong? It only complains when the response is an error. To be clear, the confusion is specifically on how to parse different response bodies based on the HTTP status code as I'm trying to do here through `exchange()` and `flatMap`. I do not understand how it can complain about `text/plain` contentType not being supported even though it is used nowhere in the stack.

issue: hi guys,i want to create "lightweight version" of my spring-boot web application, that will just run the (liquibase) database migrations and finish.i wonder what would be the best approach to achieve that.so far i was thinking about:* having separate class with CommandLineRunner, but then we would have to do if(migrations) SpringApplication.run(1.class) vs ...run(2.class) which is not very clean* chaning the ApplicationContext to remove all unnecessary bean, but it is a nightmare,so i end up with 2 beans with PostConstruct method.Bean 1 will run migrationsand Bean 2 has System.exit(0)what do you think about that approach? can you point me to better solution?reason: i want to run my application in lightweight (database migration) mode, before actuall kubernetes deployment. (as a helm hook or init container) so i dont fail with readiness/liveness probe issues due to long-running (time is dynaminc, cannot be precalculated) database migrations

solution: 

issue: Hi all. I'm struggling with an issue. In the code below a successful response serializes the response body just fine but in error cases the error body content is not serialized. Am I overlooking something :       public Mono<GCPSignUpUserResponse> signUp(String email, String password, String tenantId) throws GCPIdentityServiceException {  final Mono<GCPSignUpUserResponse> response = webClient.post()    .uri(uriBuilder -> uriBuilder      .path(GCP_IDENTITY_URI_SUFFIX_ACCOUNT)      .queryParam("key", settings.getApiKey())      .build())    .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)    .bodyValue(GCPSignUpUserRequest.builder()      .email(email)      .password(password)      .tenantId(tenantId)      .returnSecureToken(true)      .build())    .retrieve()    .onStatus(HttpStatus::isError, clientResponse -> clientResponse      .bodyToMono(GCPIdentityErrorResponse.class)      .flatMap(details -> Mono.error(new GCPIdentityServiceException(HttpStatus.resolve(clientResponse.rawStatusCode()), details))))    .bodyToMono(GCPSignUpUserResponse.class);  return response; }The error body that is being sent back to me does align with this schema :    @Data    @NoArgsConstructor    public class GCPIdentityErrorResponse {         private IdentityErrorContainer error;     private Integer code;     private String message;         @NoArgsConstructor        @ToString        public static class IdentityErrorContainer {                private IdentityError[] errors;        }                @NoArgsConstructor        @ToString        public static class IdentityError {                private String domain;                private String reason;                private String message;        }    }When I print the raw string in the error response body it is (for example) : ```{  "error": {    "code": 400,    "message": "EMAIL_EXISTS",    "errors": [      {        "message": "EMAIL_EXISTS",        "domain": "global",        "reason": "invalid"      }    ]  }}``` 
solution: 

issue: What's this got to do with spring-boot? 
solution: 

issue: ohh i am sorry think it have java related, will delete my question 
solution: 

issue: It doesn't look like it matches to me. The JSON has an `error` with a `code`, `message`, and `errors`. Your java code is mapping `error` to an `IdentityErrorContainer` that only has `errors`. In other words, I think `code` and `message` on `GCPIdentityErrorResponse` need to move to `IdentityErrorContainer`

issue: I have a question on using spring-web with spring boot.. I am getting a lot of 404 errors on my application when a lot of requests are made to the one instant of the spring boot app.. is it because I am using spring-web? Should I move to reactive spring because spring-web is one thread per request model and reactive would solve my problem? Thanks! 
solution: 

issue: Not necessarily. I don't see the link between 404s and high traffic on an application, so I can't really offer any advice here.

issue: Go and read the relevant documentation. It has nothing to do with spring boot, and we're not going to build your whole system for you. 
solution: 

issue: If you want validation to happen while receiving data, your library needs to evolve and accept reactive types. InputStream is a blocking contract and trying to make it work will expose you to memory leaks and worse.If you can't change the library, I think you could write the payload to a file and process that file asynchronously.

solution: 

issue: You can simply use the entity manager to query, instead of going through the DataSource to get a connection (which, if I'm not mistaken, won't automatically be the connection used by the current JPA transaction, and thus won't see what has been saved by JPA). Even if the connection was the JPA transaction's connection, you would need to call EntityManager.flush() to make sure that something is actually inserted in the table. 
solution: from what I see WebClient and underlining HttpClient doesn't support gzip encoding for outbound requests (in out case multi-part form data) but what would be a 'reactive way' to implement such logic. I was thinking about custom AbstractSingleValueEncoder but can't find good examples of using DataBuffer in conjunction with Input/Output streams.. 

issue: Hi Folks. I have a Spring Boot WebFlux app which exposes one REST endpoint which “produces application/x-ndjson” and returns Flux. The caller (curl) sees [ ... ] around the whole streaming result, as if the service was returning an array or Collection.  I believe  the [ and ] to be contrary to NDJSON.   Is this a known issue, and is it in my control to configure WebFlux serialisation of the Flux type?  My boot starters are “WebFlux” and “json”.  Thanks, Robin.

issue: Having a look at the M4 release and some `@WebMvcTest`s have stopped working. They defined a `Converter<Strin, MyEntity>` bean in order to mimic the JPA argument resolver, but it's not doing anything now. 
solution: 

issue: Thanks for looking at the milestone. `Converter` beans are still included in the MVC test slice so it's not due to an immediately obvious change. https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/commit/1db2f5f960c0bde4da834c321896369b462eac7f is the only change I can think of in this sort of area. I can't see why it would cause the problem you're seeing though. @bclozel may have some recommendations, and will be able to confirm if I'm right that it's 23939. Have you got `required=true` on your request param in the controller? 
solution: 

issue: To set it for the default connection, it's `spring.redis.database` To set it at runtime, you can just do a `connection.select()` If they're the same domain then it's not CORS 
solution: 

issue: I tried it but I got this:````java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Selecting a new database not supported due to shared connection. Use separate ConnectionFactorys to work with multiple databases at org.springframework.data.redis.connection.lettuce.LettuceConnection.select(LettuceConnection.java:702) at org.springframework.data.redis.connection.DefaultStringRedisConnection.select(DefaultStringRedisConnection.java:964)```` seems like someone else has requested it already https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/14196

solution: 

issue: Also moving to aws.amazon soon . NOt sure if I get same EC2 host for  http server and tomcat server 
solution: 

issue: You have a login. You must use HTTPS. 
solution: You can either serve the Angular code from your Boot app (configired to use HTTPS), or even better get a proper web server to serve Angular and reverse-proxy the Boot app.. 

issue: You just said you were already using a reverse-proxy... 
solution: 

issue: So serve the Angular code from apache2 as well. With `<Directory>` etc. 
solution: from apache 24 reverse proxying to tomcat at 8080 everythings works but when I go with  creadentails code I think I will need https for backend at currently 8080 and will have move to 443. 

issue: Hi there! I'm trying to use Spring Boot "fat" JAR with a library that needs to be unpacked before using. For this, I've added the `requiresUnpack` instruction into the `bootJar` closure of my `build.gradle` file. Now I see that corresponding entry in the final JAR has gained a comment like `UNPACK:1e6de00e7bea5ff3c9d6086fd9e2610258c051ce`. Just out of curiosity, I've found out that this is the SHA-1 hash of the stored file. I've also found the `org.springframework.boot.loader.archive.JarFileArchive#getNestedArchive` method that deals with the "UNPACK:" prefix (in the `2.3.x` branch on GitHub). But I can't find any verification of the hash there, so it seems ignored.Does anyone know the reason of such a mismatch? Or maybe I'm missing something? 
solution: 

issue: Hi all. I'm running into an issue where triggering a refresh scope doesn't trigger autoconfiguration. Debugging through the code, it looks like when the project is run initially as an executable fat jar, `org.springframework.boot.loader.LaunchedURLClassLoader` is used and `spring.factories` are found as normal, but when refresh scope is refreshed, `jdk.internal.loader.ClassLoaders.AppClassLoader` is used and no `spring.factories` are found. Anyone run into this or have ideas of what's going wrong? I've tried Spring Boot 2.2.x w/ Hoxton.SR4 and 2.3.x w/ Hoxton.SR6 all using Java 11. 
solution: 

issue: It sounds like a bug to me too. Please raise it with the Spring Cloud team. BTW, there's also a Gitter channel for Spring Cloud: https://gitter.im/spring-cloud/spring-cloud. The hash isn't used for anything. I can't recall why it's included when writing the comment. There's no benefit that I can think of in checking it when unpacking. @shrimank PropertiesLauncher has quite a few moving parts. Can you share a minimal sample that reproduces the problem?

issue: Hi! I'm trying to adjust my tests so that they use a `test` spring profile by default, but use the `spring.profiles.active` system property when provided. I can set a profile using `@ActiveProfiles`, but then the system property won't work. Any idea? 
solution:

solution: 

issue: Tried debugging, found nothing wrong. I had to set content-length to disable chunks now the "upload" works, but the receiving server sends me back an error 
solution: 

issue: (before I couldn't even complete upload) the only difference I see between postman and webclient is that one no exceptions and no errors in the json from the receiving server I read {"status": "error"} on the left rest template on the right web client [![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/544f4753db8155e6700cefb5/tGZk/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/544f4753db8155e6700cefb5/tGZk/image.png) it seems like the request is splitted with webclient (you can't see the mp4 hat you can see on the left) 
solution: 

issue: did you got the error message ? did you make some try-catch with your code IOException how is your implementation done? in your webclient did you use formData ? 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona thanks for answering. I've seen you here (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/6633) and I think my problem is somewhat related also, try simplifying your code like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50204046/1521064) and see if it still isn't parallel 
solution: 

issue: I would be really grateful if anyone could take a look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64594052/spring-boot-web-client-slow-asynchronous-requestsI'm trying to figure out why my parallell requests using the `WebClient` executes so slow. Nearly as slow as running sequentially. 
solution: 

issue: do you have a project on github or equivalent that I can download, compile and run? are you sure the requests are really so slow and it's not just slowly logging? 
solution: 

issue: i think the issue with some request headers, check the requested headers that come to your application try to debug them, and check this issue on apache bugzilla - tomcat - 9, similar to your issue:https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=64859

issue: JDBC uses blocking I/O underneath. What Oracle did was adding asynchronous/reactive methods to their JDBC driver that they call Reactive JDBC extensions. Those extensions are purely vendor-specific to the Oracle database driver. R2DBC is an independent specification that isn't related to JDBC nor is JDBC related to R2DBC.

issue: I think Spring Boot 2.4.0 releases in two days? it depends on Spring Framework 5.3.0 Spring Boot 2.3.5 depends on Spring 5.2.10, which should also have that issue that Brian mentioned covered 
solution: 

issue: If you're a customer/user of that vuln scanning product, maybe you can report that CVE as a false positive or at least as a "requires more context about the app" issue.Again, you could argue that all Java apps are vulnerable (no library needed) because they can deserialize Java classes from untrusted sources. 
solution: 

issue: maybe they didn't have a chance to test 5.2.10 and 5.3.0 yet.. 
solution: 

issue: @bilak just wondering if it makes sense to use liquibase inside a container with spring. wouldn't it be easier to convert it into `schema.sql`? 
solution: @seguri I just want to stick with current developement technique where we are using liquibase a lot. So for local developement it would be ok to use liquibase enabled. But for kubernetes I'd like to disable it and only use it as `Job` that is being executed once per deployment as mentioned before. But I'm open for better suggestions. 

issue: I did skim those links. As I understand it, Liquibase's locking is only a problem if a process fails before it can update the table to release a lock. Running it in a Helm hook won't eliminate the possibility of that happening, but it may reduce it a bit. If it runs on each pod creation and the DB is already up-to-date, the lock should be taken and then dropped almost immediately when Liquibase realises it has nothing to do. 
solution: 

issue: @bianster_gitlab if that helps, you can send my contact to them if they have questions about this particular CVE. Everything is on my github profile. 
solution: 

issue: How could I conditionally ("something.enabled = true") create/add a filter? @ConditionalOnProperty works well, but using it on another `SomeConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` does not. It seems to not work well with the main non conditional WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter 
solution: 

issue: Thank you for the reply! we are adding the StringHttpMessageConverter before calling the exchange method. is that discouraged? ``` restTemplate.setErrorHandler(defaultErrorHandler);    restTemplate        .getMessageConverters()        .add(0, new StringHttpMessageConverter(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)); ``` 
solution: 

issue: if that resttemplate instance is being accessed concurrently, this might be the problem. You can customize the message converters, but should probably do that only once during startup before issuing requests 
solution: 

issue: Okay thanks a lot. I will try not doing this 
solution: 

issue: I use either `@EnableConfigurationProperties` where it will be used, or put the `@ConfigurationProperties` directly on a `@Bean` if it makes sense.As that guide says, they're only using `@Configuration` to make it an instantiated bean with minimal code. If it was just `@Component` then it wouldn't be created as it's not used anywhere. 
solution: 

issue: I'm trying to dockerize my spring-boot app. I created a simple Dockerfile with no optimization yet. I want to use --net=host to share the stack between host and container. Custom port is specified through -e SERVER_PORT=9080 on commandline.The exact identical configuration works on bare metal, but once dockerized Tomcat server is reached, but the app is not. 
solution: 

issue: Thanks Brian. I'm not aware about "usual channels" -- I'm just subscribed to github releases ;-) 
solution: 

issue: that sentence means that if you run actuator on a separate port, your main app (on :8080) and your actuator endpoints (on :9090) can't share everything. For example, HTTP client connections aren't processed by the same HTTP connectors. This means that you could end up in a situation where your health endpoint on :9090 says "UP" while your :8080 is overflown with traffic and cannot process requests at the time 
solution: 

issue: @bclozel but metrics such db pool, jms connections are shared in both or not? not bug yet, but it's somehow confusing, because we don't know what is really included and what is not...so maybe there should be more about it in documentation.

issue: Hi Spring Boot team (and all)! I noticed that beans implementing Thymeleaf's IDialect interface are automatically added as dialects by Spring Boot, but are not included in the WebMvcTest slice. Shouldn't they be? Should I open an issue about that?

solution: 

issue: it's buffering startup steps (using the provided capacity); clearing it allows to record more steps (otherwise steps are dropped when the capacity is reached) 
solution: 

issue: So you have to constantly query it during startup? You can't just wait for startup and then get the analysis? That's also going to be tricky if you can't access it until startup is complete. 
solution: 

issue: Is that your experience when starting up your app? What capacity did you set so far? 
solution: 

issue: I didn't set anything... If it's not going to run out of capacity then that removes the need to clear the results At the moment it doesn't seem very useful. At best you can get the analysis, but only once, and it's a fiddle if you need to login to get the auth. 
solution: 

issue: I just upgraded and saw a new feature. Thought I would have a look to see what is contributing to the startup time. But unlike all the other reporting endpoints, it's not a GET 
solution: 

issue: If this is about https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/26023, the issue is IMO still a good place to discuss.What Rossen is saying is that your current implementation can cause memory leaks (if the decoded body is not fully consumed or not consumed at all). Rossen will get back to you on that issue.

issue: Hi, I am new for here and I have a problem. I am using Spring boot to create a API Rest. However, when I use embeddable type, the table intermediate doesn't insert any data. I don't find the problem. I have posted my code in stack. If someone finds the problem, please help me. https://stackoverflow.com/q/64861471/13331446 . I'm sorry if asking this question does not comply with the group's rules but I'm desperate 
solution: 

issue: those are interfaces, how does that work with autovalue? 
solution: 

issue: thanks, i'll watch that meanwhile, by "reactive" do you mean Mono/Flux everywhere in the code? or the server's threading model - the event loop? if I should refactor my application for using WebMVC instead of WebFlux, i'd just like to understand why...

solution: I've tried code that very similar to what you've shared thus far and it behaves differently for me. Can please you share a complete, minimal project that I can import into Eclipse and run?. The plugin produces metadata that optimises startup. Its use isn't required and should make no functional difference..

issue: Hello I need help I create a Spring boot with sub modules with Gradle (kt) and Kotlin When I run java -jar I have this error > aucun attribut manifest principal dans app.jarIn english : > no manifest attribut in app.jarDo you know what does it mean 
solution: 

issue: maybe the Spring Boot POM is corrupted on your disk. Try and refresh dependencies with `mvn dependency:purge-local-repository` in your project, then try building again. did you apply the spring boot plugin in the module that builds the executable jar? This can happen if the spring boot plugin is not applied and the app is not repackaged as an executable jar (with the bootJar task) 
solution: 

issue: Thank you, sir - you're a gentleman and a scholar. This was exactly the issue. I've corrected the starter POM and everything is working as intended. Thank you again!

solution: 

issue: @bilak I think this post might help you https://netflixtechblog.com/tuning-tomcat-for-a-high-throughput-fail-fast-system-e4d7b2fc163f . Also maxThreads will be reached way before than acceptCount, to check on metrics for use you can use spring boot actuators (not sure if they will work for what you are looking for) maybe that is a path

issue: Spring Data JDBC isn’t 5 years old (that’s why I am asking) ah I got my answer on my question on the SO thread. 
solution: I am using https://github.com/jirutka/spring-data-jdbc-repository and now if I switched on https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-jdbc then what are changes required to do. that I need to check. 

issue: That project seems like an alternative (small) ORM, implementing some of the Spring Data repository interfaces. Would they have to pull in Spring Data, does that perfrom ORM, or does that mean _hello, Hibernate_? 
solution: 

issue: Thanks acerdas! But that approach would parse the property as a property, not as an argument. All arguments end up as properties, but the opposite is not true. I need them to be argument because of behavior dependant on SimpleCommandLineArgumentSource. I mean, if they were equal, then Pivotal guys would have not added args option in addition to props in @springBootTest 
solution: 

issue: Well the approach will be to parse an arg as a property  but now I understand that is not good for you, hope you find a solution 
solution: hard to say with what you’ve shared. What’s the issue in the first place? If you have a small sample we can run we could have a look. Can you share why the value of the argument should be dynamic? Perhaps you shouldn’t be using `@SpringBootTest` at all and rather start a `SpringApplication` in your test?. 

issue: Okay, let me whip up an example and push it to github real quick. Will that work? 
solution: 

issue: Wow, this is why we ask folks to provide an example, because it often leads them to the issue. In this case, I can't reproduce the issue, even in the actual project where I saw it. I restarted my IDE and now things are working as expected. Very odd. If I encounter it again, I'll see if I can isolate it and report back. Sorry for the noise and thanks for checking in with me. 
solution: 

issue: Yes it will be forwarded, but you can read the request inputstream only once. If you read completely before it's fed to the handler, this shouldn't work. 
solution:

issue: Hi community. I've upgraded to SpringBoot 2.4.0 and using the Spring Cloud Configserver from the latest SC SNAPSHOTS. I've already migrated the configuration files and have a profile that is activated to fetch the configuration from the remote config server. This works so far but the `ConfigDataEnvironmentContributor` for the service' application.yml is not active anymore and the application throws an error at startup.```spring:  config:    activate:      on-profile: DISTRIBUTED    import: configserver:http://localhost:8099  cloud:    config:      discovery:        enabled: true      enabled: true      fail-fast: true    discovery:      enabled: true```error:```Failed to bind properties under 'spring.cloud.config.discovery.enabled' to java.lang.Boolean:    Property: spring.cloud.config.discovery.enabled    Value: true    Origin: class path resource [application.yml] - 157:18    Reason: Inactive property source 'Config resource 'classpath:/application.yml' via location 'optional:classpath:/' (document #5)' imported from location 'class path resource [application.yml]' cannot contain property 'spring.cloud.config.discovery.enabled' [origin: class path resource [application.yml] - 157:18]``` In addition to this I can't use the logic service name for the config server anymore, that is resolved by Eureka and must use `configserver:http://localhost:8099` instead of `configserver:${cfgscheme}://configserver:${cfgport}` but this is another issue.Any thoughts what I am missing or what is wrong with my config?

solution: 

issue: I am using Log4j2 
solution: 

issue: Yes, referring to the executable jar package... I suppose no getting around a restart 
solution: 

issue: Yes you can get around a restart by starting a second instance with the socket reuse option. Anything trying to connect to it will be none the wiser. Of course, if you have dependencies like database schemas or something built in then you may indeed need to shutdown the old instance first to prevent corruption.

Ah that looks handy thanks and works but not for the security exceptions, as you said above they must be handled by filters outside of the HandlerExceptionResolvers.Filter will have to do, thanks.

issue: if kubernetes is killing your pod when liveness probe is not available, then it probably makes sense. Or no? Liveness is something different from readiness. If readiness is not available, then only new trafic is not routed to that pod, untill it returns that it's ready to accept traffic again 
solution: 

issue: and for readiness I think the normaln endpoint is ok, because if application is under load and there is few requests being processed probably it won't respond immediatelly and that should be a good sign for kubernetes to stop forwarding request to it yes but I'm asking about different port for liveness and different port for readiness. I think that completely makes sense in kubernetes world. Liveness should respond everytime even when there's load on application and responses are not immediate. That means application is still alive but maybe under load. However readiness could be placed on same port where application is processing request, when kubernetes won't be able to reach readiness probe it will probably remove the pod from loadbalancer. Does this makes sense?

solution: 

issue: Even curiouser, turns out it was like that in 2.3.* too, but only for controllers, for router {} functional DSL slash was ignored. but after update to 2.4 it is not ignored anymore ```kotlin@Bean fun post() = router { (accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON) and "/test-controller").nest {  POST("/") {   ServerResponse.status(201).body("controller works")  } }}```^^ this works with tests given above in spring boot 2.3.* but doesn't work with spring boot 2.4.*

issue: Having some trouble with `DataSourceUnwrapper` and `AbstractRoutingDataSource`. It appears it will only work if the target is an interface, but `HikariDataSource` is a class. Is there anything to be done? 
solution:

solution: 

issue: I've opened https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/24517. 
solution:

solution: Folks - I have a Spring Boot app - wherein it has one Email program. This email goes to the users on a particular time on a weekday. now am using @SchedulerLock, @Scheduled cron annotations along with Shedlock table. 

issue: Now my app is deployed in 2 instances - as a result the email program gets triggered twice Any suggestion on how to prevent this? On googling I can see that a S/w developer has made a custom solution and using that annotation can prevent this issue- but I can’t use that Any help? 
solution: 

issue: and the scheduled method has something like     @SchedulerLock(name = "doTransmitFull", lockAtMostFor = "PT1H“)? that is weird, it should work. 
solution: 

issue: That says interface, yes. But it's not obvious why it wouldn't work to wrap a class. It's an `AbstractRoutingDataSource`, which has a working `unwrap` method that can return a `HikariDataSource`, but `DataSourceUnwrapper` won't call it because it's not an interface. 
solution: 

issue: https://gitter.im/spring-cloud/spring-cloud 1) Correct. In Spring Boot, a dependency on r2dbc-pool (as included in the R2DBC starter) is sufficient to enable pooling.2) No. There's no DB driver in the starter. You should add the one that's appropriate for the DB that you're using. 
solution: 

issue: Ah OK, I’m not using Kotlin at the moment. Sorry can’t help with that 
solution: 

issue: OMG sorry, I made a mistake in item 2). I meant2) there is no need to add a `io.r2dbc:r2dbc-pool` dependency as it comes together with s`pring-boot-starter-data-r2dbc`But anyway I guess it is correct. Thank you !

issue: Maven would let you do pretty much anything with a pluginc config so you could copy it somewhere from the lib and refer to it. It won’t load from the classpath, no. Sorry. 
solution: 

issue: 2.4.0.M3 used 1.18.12 whereas 2.4.1 uses 1.18.16. Perhaps the 1.18.16 jar was corrupted when Maven downloaded it? When you said you'd cleared the cache, was that IDEA's cache or Maven's? If it was IDEA's it might be worth clearing Lombok from Maven's local cache and trying again.

issue: If I have a database schema do I still need to map objects to tables with SpringJPA. If not, what is my alternative to connect to the database and query the table? Is it JDBC? 
solution: 

issue: Good to know that there are issues! Thanks! Just noticed: Why are there methods in the jdbctemplate maked as nullable when they can’t produce null? This leads to ugly warnings in intelliJ:```java @Override @Nullable public <T> T queryForObject(String sql, RowMapper<T> rowMapper, @Nullable Object... args) throws DataAccessException {  List<T> results = query(sql, args, new RowMapperResultSetExtractor<>(rowMapper, 1));  return DataAccessUtils.nullableSingleResult(results); }```for example. the nullabeSingleResult returns something or throws an exception when there is not exactly one result.Is this a bug or am I missing something?

issue: I have a spring boot app without a web serverIt reads a topic from Kafka and writes to the databaseApp is deployed in OpenShift (Kubernetes), but since it doesn't have a web server or actuator endpoints, i need to configure custom health checksthere is another option of implementing a health check (startup/readiness/liveness probe) - let Openshift connect to the app's container via TCPas I understand, for that my app needs to actively listen to a certain porthow do I make it do so, in my Spring app java code?

issue: request scope is usually implemented with a Threadscoped variable. you need to provide“ the variable in a thread-neutral way 
solution: I’ve tried several things such as configuring the RequestContextListener or RequestContextFilter or DispatcherServlet to allow child threads to inherit the parent request context, but the child thread is never able to use the resources throughout its lifecycle because the request becomes no longer active. I have seen suggestions of deep copying everything in the RequestAttributes thread local container over to the child threads request context, but this feels dangerous.. 

issue: Easy fix for this -- I just wasn't really sure about MDC altogether. If I'm deep in the service layer trying to access a request scoped bean, is the idea that if the bean exists inside of the MDC that I can somehow fallback on it? I got to the point last night where I started considering rolling all of this on my own using threadlocals. I realized that was a pretty dark path to go down and reverted.

issue: I don't think it makes sense to list non-singleton beans, because there is an unbounded number of instances for each declaration I suppose you could distinguish beans that could exist from beans that currently do exist Depending on what exactly that does, the generated class may not have any annotations.

issue: It may depend on if and how they're being proxied. If there's an annotation on the implementation but it's declared with an interface, then it may not be detectable.

Not strictly a Spring Boot related question but `spring-messaging` has an abstraction for that You could start looking at `MessageMapping` and the various implementations for RSocket and websocket in the Spring Framework code base. `Message` and `MessageHeaders` have the necessary abstraction for payload and headers. `org.springframework.messaging.Message` that is.

solution: 

issue: An executable war gives you more control as you're not reliant on someone else maintaining a version of Tomcat that's configured correctly to meet your application's needs. Instead, everything is in the war file and all you need is for Java to be installed. This makes deployment easier and less error-prone. Executable wars (or jars) are the recommended approach.

solution: 

issue: So do u think its something my code is overriding 
solution: I see that in a different thread, you're saying that you're working on migrating an app from vanilla spring mvc to spring boot. If that's the case here this is most likely due to configurations overriding the opinion brought by Spring Boot and not related to a particular Jackson issue. A minimal project showing the problem would help..

issue: Hi Andy. No, I am just setting the property in the application.yml, as if it were a spring/app property 
solution: 

issue: Properties in `application.yml` don't become system properties. They're added to Spring's `Environment` but won't appear in `System.getProperties()`

issue: And I guess they won't have effect either then. I mean if I set up something like java.awt.headless  (I know there is the headless() builder option on SpringApp, but just for the example's sake) in my application.yml and I dont provide any override through env_vars or the like, it is not gonna be processed by the system.

issue: hello. I'm trying to get `./gradlew bootBuildImage` to work withouth mounting host `docker.sock`. I've been at it for hours now, but there seems to be absolutely no way to configure it to connect to docker daemon over tcp instead. is it impossible or am I blind? :( 
solution: 

issue: It should honour your `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable 
solution: 

issue: it absolutely does not always complaining about not being able to access /var/run/docker.sock looking at the code, it seems to be hardcoded to mount that file in every case ```bootBuildImage {  environment = ["DOCKER_HOST": "tcp://127.0.0.1:2376"]  docker {    host = "tcp://127.0.0.1:2376"  }  verboseLogging = true}```

solution: 

issue: I'll try and let you know...thanks for hints @wilkinsoa maybe I didn't described the issue properly...problem is that I want to have option to change the `name` with property for map `systems`. So should this also work somehow with PropertySource? 
solution: 

issue: after quite some time searching, just after posting this question I've found it! The `cloneUser` was package private (so no `public` keyword)! That's interesting, is there a difference how these things are packaged into a jar? As bootRun didn't work, but the executable jar did!

solution: 

issue: Thanks for your answer, do you have any example of using the wiretap to get the whole body of all the requests and responses? 
solution: Everything in `WEB-INF/classes` is on the classpath, as are the contents of the jars in `WEB-INF/lib`.. 

issue: that doesn't sound like it should happen, but admittedly, I don't use maven (or WAR files), so can't be sure. Are you sure it's not something else that is pulling in these dependencies? 
solution: 

issue: You probably have another compile or runtime dependency that transitively depends on spring-boot-starter-test, or on junit. Use maven's dependency tasks to track where those dependencies come from. Try reproducing the issue by starting with a simple project generated from start.spring.io, and then adding dependencies one by one, to find what the problem is. 
solution: 

issue: @fryie @jnizet you guys are right. my bad. very sorry. when i tried to create a reproducible example, i did not see the issue. then realized I am doing something wrong. turns out, one of our internal libraries is pulling those test jars with compile scope. Previously I was just going by the dependency tree. when I ran mvn dependency:tree , it showed those jars were only pulled by starter-test. I need to read the mvn dependency:tree docs apparently. Thank you both!!  [January 24, 2021 6:45 PM](https://gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot?at=600dc042ac653a0802dcab2c) Just in case if it is of any help to you

issue: I am getting this error org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClientRequestException: nested exception is io.netty.channel.StacklessClosedChannelException It seems that in the part of the pipeline that I am inserting the channel is already closed 
solution: 

issue: you're providing a full `application.yml` file here, and this should use the `import:` directive instead. If you want to use a config tree, then the files under `/etc/config/` should be very different. See https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-external-config-files-configtree Also I don't think you need to specify the cloud platform in your deployment configuration, Spring Boot will detect k8s on its own.

issue: Hello, I have a weird issue with Spring Boot 2.3.6 and Spring Doc.

I tried deleting the content of .m2/repository and reinstalling, but it did not help, apparently. 
solution: 

issue: FWIW, I don't think that issue is warranted. The Springdoc team aren't responsible for your classpath. You need to use a compatible combination of versions. You could upgrade to Spring Boot 2.4 (which uses Spring Framework 5.3) or stick with Spring Boot 2.3 and use a version of Springdoc that is compatible with Spring Framework 5.2. 1.4.x of Springdoc looks like it would work with Spring Boot 2.3

solution: 

issue: It's not possible using a filter's url pattern. `/v*/**` style path-matching is a Spring Framework feature and the filter's URL pattern is handled by the servlet container. You could map your filter to every request and then write some code that uses Spring Framework's `AntPathMatcher` or `PathPattern` to perform the matching. That's an implementation of what I suggested above. Given the limitations of the servlet spec, I don't think it's hacky.

solution: 

issue: You are right, I used JMeter and jmc command.'jmc' command can realize it.Late reply sry. 
solution: 

issue: @wilkinsona  For a webflux service, I noticed that in certain cases the response code received by the client is not the same as the one observed by a `WebFliter` on the `ServerHttpResponse`. Here's an example of this: https://github.com/flavium31/spring-webflux-status-code-demo . In this example, a `ResponseStatusException` is thrown from the controller which eventually causes the response code to be set to 418, but when logging the status code from the `WebFilter` the output is 200. I was hoping you could help me understand why this is.The reason I'm asking is that this seems to cause an issue in Spring Cloud Sleuth, which determines the status of traces it captures based on the `ServerHttpResponse` - so a lot of traces incorrectly get status 200. This was initially raised with @jonatan-ivanov here: https://gitter.im/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth?at=6011c56d55359c58bf049831 
solution: 

issue: hi, i am trying to under the below code in ErrorPageFilter ```private void handleErrorStatus(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, int status, String message) throws ServletException, IOException {        if (response.isCommitted()) {            this.handleCommittedResponse(request, (Throwable)null);        } else {            String errorPath = this.getErrorPath(this.statuses, status);            if (errorPath == null) {                response.sendError(status, message);            } else {                response.setStatus(status);                this.setErrorAttributes(request, status, message);                request.getRequestDispatcher(errorPath).forward(request, response);            }        }    }```what will be the HTTP verb of the forward here. 
solution: 

issue: The `request` encapsulates the verb so it'll be whatever's in the request. 
solution: 

issue: Yes, it'll be a `POST` to `/error`.Boot's `BasicErrorController` uses a plain `@RequestMapping`. Yours should do the same. 
solution: 

issue: thanks again. but if my application exposes only GET and POST , can I just use ```@RequestMapping(method = {RequestMethod.GET, RequestMethod.POST} , path =  "/error") 
solution: 

issue: That depends on how you want error responses to requests that use other verbs to be handled. You may only expose GET and POST, but you can't stop clients from using the other verbs. 
solution: 

issue: Ok, so what are you looking for? That's a question for the Spring Data team. You can find them in https://gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-data

issue: Yes, you can. Configure your `RestTemplate` with a custom `ResponseErrorHandler`. It's `DefaultResponseErrorHandler` that's truncating the body. Unfortunately its `getErrorMessage` method is private so you can't override it and the maximum length is hardcoded at 200. That means you'll have to provide your own implementation. You may want to raise a Spring Framework issue to see if they'd consider making `DefaultResponseErrorHandler` extensible or configurable: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues

solution: 

issue: *TransactionalEventListener* handling logic is spring boot specific  and triggerBeforeCommit is fired by *org.springframework.transaction.support.AbstractPlatformTransactionManager#processCommit* so its spring-boot specfic actually what I want is to implement auditing logicin prePersist() I will add transaction synchronization and in beforeCommit() I will send to Kafka lets say. In case of failure I will throw exception and rollback DB transactions also. Anyway I guess its not part of spec. 
solution: 

issue: @Transactional uses aspect oriented programming. Your Foo instance will be wrapped by a proxy that adds the transactional behavior, but this proxy behavior is only applied for calls that are not internal. So this.foo() will not get the transactional behavior, but a Bar instance doing fooInstance.foo() would

issue: Hello, guys, I encountered an issue regarding using Redis cache metrics in springboot 2.4.2. Anyone has clue about this? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66358386/redis-cache-metrics-doesnt-work-in-springboot-version-2-4-2 
solution: 

issue: The docs show the default builder as the default value for the `builder` property: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/gradle-plugin/reference/htmlsingle/#build-image-customization with Boot 2.4, it’s `paketobuildpacks/builder:base`. The Java-related buildpacks included in that builder are documented in the Paketo docs here: https://paketo.io/docs/buildpacks/language-family-buildpacks/java/ The Spring Boot docs don’t touch on details like JVM provider, version, etc because the Boot plugins are delegating all the real work of building the image to a CNB builder and buildpacks. The Paketo docs are pretty good if that’s the builder/buildpacks you’re using. If you have deeper questions there the Paketo slack is very active for support.

issue: I have a really weird thing happening in my spring boot application concerning logging and MDC variables. I'm using log4j 2.14.0 and have a json layout with the following config:```{  "time": {    "$resolver": "timestamp",    "pattern": {      "format": "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z'",      "timeZone": "UTC",      "locale": "en_US"    }  },  "severity": {    "$resolver": "level",    "field": "name"  },  "message": {    "$resolver": "message",    "includeStacktrace": true,    "stringified": true  },  "thread": {    "$resolver": "thread",    "field": "name"  },  "logger": {    "$resolver": "logger",    "field": "name"  },  "customerId": {    "$resolver": "pattern",    "pattern": "%X{customerId}"  },  "line": {    "$resolver": "source",    "field": "lineNumber"  }}```The weirdest thing is, when I log an error and pass the exception it ends up being in my `customerId` MDC variable?!

solution: 

issue: Many thanks. I was also looking to the milestone github page ;-) So 3.x will be an evolution of SB but not a big revolution ? 
solution: 

issue: Ideally it would work, but it doesn't at the moment. In the jar case we can just decide not to add something to `BOOT-INF/lib`. In the war case, the war plugin's in control of what goes in `WEB-INF/lib` and we'd then need to figure out what shouldn't be there and remove it. https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/15808 is tracking that fix.

solution: 

issue: As I've said before, Framework questions don't really belong here. Especially for 4.x as this channel is for Spring Boot and no supported version of Boot uses Framework 4.x. Stack Overflow's a better place to research and ask a question of your own if you can't find an existing question and answer.

issue: Sorry, I should be more specific. That message shows up in the browser. Happy to provide any other information needed to describe this. 
solution: 

issue: The mime type should be inferred automatically. Given that you mentioned Spring Security, I suspect that you're trying to access a CSS or JS file that you're not authorised the access. As a result, the response is an HTML error response or login page.

issue: Using mvn springboot:run. Thanks for quick reply Andy 
solution: 

issue: `mvn spring-boot:run` doesn't run your application built as a war file so it's not quite an apples-to-apples comparison. Have you tried running it in a container having unzipped the war file? You can do that by running `java -cp . org.springframework.boot.loader.WarLauncher` from the root of the unzipped war . 
solution: 

issue: great thanks, if we dont specify this, will the session be created by default on every http call

issue: spring config server is not an option in my current project (not yet) :( i would like to have support for properties in my "pure" springboot app which is runnning in aws beanstalk. Our team decide to have our "mssql-connection-information" in a aws security manager blob. thanks for the hint :D i looked into the aws.secretsmanager.* ... but I'm not sure if this works for me ... because the cloud-guys in my team decide to put "only" the jdbc-connection infos into a aws secret manager. maybe I dont understand the feature correctly but I understand that this springboot feature can only fetch one secret per app from aws but not many. So I was thinking about a feature in the middle :D I would like to use property-values like this my.rds.login="${/prefix/context#propertyname-from-secret}". springboot should delegate all property-placeholders starting with the "pattern" /prefix/context# to my property-placeholder-resolver and there I would like to reuse existing springboot aws secret manager functionality.

solution: I have some questions regarding the use of `@Transactional` with coroutines:1) If I have code like:```kotlin@Transactionalfun myFun() {   // do DB stuff   runBlocking { suspendFun() }}// this would be in a different classsuspend fun suspendFun() {   // do more DB stuff}```Is it correct to assume that the `suspendFun()` can't see the transaction of `myFun()` because it's running in a different thread? Because I was trying to do this but was getting weird errors since the coroutine function couldn't see the uncommitted changes and so would lead to errors when trying to save an entity with a `@OneToOne` association that had been saved in `myFun()`.If so, is it somehow possible to pass the transaction context to the `runBlocking` call?2) If I instead lift the `runBlocking` to the top-level (controller) code, it seems to work OK. So my question then is: If I have```kotlin@Transactionalsuspend fun myFun() { ... }```will the transaction context be bound to the coroutine context? Some github issues seem to indicate that this would be the case.... 

issue: hello , why this dosn't work please```when(customerRepository.deleteById(customer.getId())).thenReturn(200);```Error : reason: no instance(s) of type variable(s) T exist so that void conforms to T 
solution: 

issue: The return type of `deleteById()`is void. And you're trying to make it return 200. Delete this line of code. If you call a void method on a mock, the method will just do nothing. You don't need to tell it to return something, since it can't return anything anyway.

issue: Passing the no-arg constructor resulted in the following compilation error  public State() {    } >Non-canonical record constructor must delegate to another constructor > Passing the no-arg constructor resulted in the following compilation errorAnyone? 
solution: 

issue: BeanPropertyRowMapper can't be used with records, since it consists in creating an instance of a Java Bean with its no-arg constructor, and then calling its setters to populate the bean. But records don't have a no-arg constructors, and are immutable and thus don't have setters. So, either use a traditional Java Bean, or use records, but then don't use BeanPropertyRowMapper.

issue: > tbh, I'm downgrading most of my projects to Java 8 because of Springs support so that's my main motivation, when will I be able to stop doing this :)What do you mean? I hope you're not downgrading because of Spring, we're marking sure that we're compatible with newer versions as soon as they're out. JDK8 is the baseline, not a "must have" https://start.spring.io/ defaults to JDK11, because this is the current LTS. 
solution: 

issue: I'm trying to implement using a ReadReplica-DataSource with a AbstractRoutingDataSource and TransactionSynchronizationManager#isCurrentTransactionReadOnly.But looking at AbstractPlatformTransactionManager, the threadlocal is always set after the call to determineCurrentLookupKey, so I always get false.

solution: 

issue: This problem related to customizing buildpacks was reported in `2.5.0-M2`, and fixed in `2.5.0-M3` (released just last night). What version of Boot are you using? the location referred to in a binding must be a directory that contains a file named `type` and any other files that the binding should use. referring directly to the datadog.properties file won’t work. (forgot to link to the bug with custom buidpacks: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/25378) 
solution: 

issue: @scottfrederick I've pulled down the latest version but still getting the same error. Do you want me to raise an issue with Spring Boot or should I use the verbose flag to get more information? 
solution: 

issue: As things stand, you'll have to make the jdbc transaction manager `@Primary` if that's the one that you want `SpringTransactionProvider` to use.  Arguably `JooqAutoConfiguration#transactionProvider` should be annotated with `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` so that you can provide your own. That would then give you more flexibility over how the right transaction manager is identified. Please open an issue if that's something you'd like us to take a look at doing. 
solution: 

issue: I can reproduce what you’re seeing. When the datadog binding is provided and properly formed, an image gets built. I can’t verify that datadog sets up the agent correctly, but I do get an image. When the datadog binding does not exist or is not properly formed (e.g. with a `type` file containing `DatadogTrace`), then I get the `No buildpack groups passed detection.`. I think this is because the datadog bp should be marked as “optional” in its metadata.
