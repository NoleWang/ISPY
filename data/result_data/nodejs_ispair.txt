solution: !. 

issue: @tejohnso , looks like destroy is part of the stream events.  Docs don't say much but they do say:socket.destroy()#Ensures that no more I/O activity happens on this socket. Only necessary in case of errors (parse error or so).https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_socket_destroyI also found a reference to it in the node source in /lib/_stream_readable.js on github.

issue:  [<-CODE->] I can't get Nnpm to update my dependencies mypackage.jsonlooks like this. [<-CODE->] right, I want to update grunt-bump to 0.7.0 but it's^0.6.0 really. I thought that's what the update command did? oh. I thought it was >= 0.6.0 && < 1.0.0 listepo: thanks that helps a lot. fannarsh: that's cool. thanks 
solution: 

issue: Current = your installed version Wanted = the version specified by your package.json Then you will have to update your package.json ^0.6.0 =  >=0.6.0 && <0.7.0 
solution: 

issue: ^wat? So they all end up global? that’s a very bad idea 
solution: if you have var with same name in external context - you will overwrite it. if you write some data in not defined in current scope variable - you can't say 100% you use variable from current scope.

solution: 

issue: Hi there, I'm using npm as my build system and currently I struggle with a lot of boilerplate code inpackage.json's scripts section. My current approach is to extract the build process to a different building module with the build scripts being in that module'spackage.jsonand inject the necessary definitions (e.g. fortest) into the parent module'spackage.jsonduring the postinstall hook of the building module. Any thoughts on this approach? :)

issue: Is there a flag I can use when doingnpm install somethingto indicate explicitly that I want that package’s peer dependencies also to be installed? I know the automagic installation of peer deps was removed in npm 3, but wondering if it can still be turned on via a flag not in my use case

issue: is there any package for adding packages from latestnpm install <packages>without--saveor--save-devtopackage.json? sometimes I just forget to add save modifier and it takes some time to install again 
solution: I ended up with writing bash wrapper to check this case [<-LINK->]. 

issue: I have a simple question.   I'm running npm 3 and I understand it's supposed to use a flat folder structure in node_modules, but I am not seeing that.  Everything seems to be nested like in npm 2.   I've deleted the entire node_modules folder and ran 'npm installl' to recreate.   i've verified ii'm running npm 3.5.4. Is there something subtle that I'm missing? 
solution: also when you say "seeing that" -npm lswill still show the nesting. 

issue: Thank you.   I\'m new to node, so when I saw node_modules folders within node_modules folders all over the place, I assumed my install of npm3 wasn\'t working properly.  Turns out, it\'s two things 1) "flat if possible" as ihjarb indicated, but also 2) packages that were created/bundled with npm2 and use the bundleDependencies section, will ship with the old style npm2 format.   The problem is that with bower is doing that now.  See issue: [<-ISSUE->] This requires me to install bower locally only and at a short root-path like c:\\s\\, etc. thank you 
solution: it's not a package manager, it's a glorified curl CLI to github.. 

issue: ljharb: "any project on bower but not on npm is not worth using" sounds pretty radical, what if there are no alternatives? 
solution: in the very very rare case there's not like twenty alternatives on npm, then build one.. I'd rather setup webpack for bower support or create oldschool vendor folder and copy sources there. What's a point of calling bower a trash, it was cool back in a vendor folders days, but now npm is better choice. 

issue: Hello. I am new to web developement (as a whole), i know html, css and a little js.. You could say i can build sites - in those languages. My problem is - where to go now? Frontend is one half, what about backend. From what i understand, Wordpress can supply me whatever backend i need, if it's not too fancy, but i dont want to go directly towards Wordpress - so what type of backend is the alternative. Node and Meteor seems attractive... Is my head in the right place?

issue: I am using debian, and debian is really pissing me off with javascript. It refuses to run nodejs and tells me that there are missing stuff in the system. I tried nodejs-legacy. it got it working and then decided not to work with electron, meteor software. I would download arch, and be done with it but I can't since I would require ethernet cable to rebuild it which I cannot do at this time. So I decided to download nodejs source tar ball. I unpacked it, and run ./configure. It tells me there is no such file or directory. I looked inside, and I see nothing about make / make install. There isn't anything that allows me to build this sourcecode. This is frustrating. Inside of the source, it contains bin, include, lib, readme, share, and changelog. thats it There is no make file.... yeah debian sucks so much. I love arch but can't use it atm. I decided to follow this, and it works! [<-LINK->] Ah make sense I was thinking what I downloaded was a source. 
solution: 

issue: Hey, guys,  do you know why when I try to install Grunt "npm install grunt --save-dev" , suddenly "node_modules" directory fills up with all kinds of stuff?is that all needed for Grunt to work? 
solution: (grunt is massive, you can use normal npm run-scripts and avoid grunt entirely if you want). 

issue: doesn't matter, if grunt is part of what your site needs to work, grunt should be locally installed fromnpm init? that doesn't sound right 
solution: 

issue: ljharb: ". bower is clown shoes" .. Just a question , I know you are anti bower ( we have spoken it about it previously ) just out of interest though, if someone is downloading packages to be used on index.html right , but they usenpm install+ gulp + express and you are working on these files do you not think that in terms of development putting everything into node_modules is agood idea? Node packages can be defined for a specific use case ( ie gulp tasks  ) or a code base for specific implementation of running code for the web application ( ie angular.js ). right now i can open up bower_components and inspect a project a lot easier then scroll down node_modules when 98% of the files in node_modules are not dependent on what i am looking for. Again i am going with this idea of SoC that i think bower solves. But why is it "clown shoes" ? what makes it a "horrible choice" ? I dont  suppose you have a blog post on this. Im very curious. thanks 
solution: 

issue: fannarsh: the opposite is true, Bower has used a flat dependency tree since ever, while NPM was nested in 2 and is flat in 3 mhsjlw: @basilinjoeYou dont need cluster for that, child process is enough

issue: Hey guys. What is the best convention and practice of defining models in Node.js? Is it good to define using constructors? [<-CODE->] Sorry for asking this very basic question.

solution: 

issue: basiclaser: some services provide api for revealing original urls 
solution: yeh i saw that, thought i should be able to solve it myself though just by requesting like you recommended. 

issue: i have conditions like this in code all over the place [<-CODE->] Are there any cleaner ways to do that? bad example,changed it. i am looking for ways to avoid the undefined error, when i look for a property deeper in the object get undefined as return in fine, i didnt want the error of accessing undefined in fact getting a return of undefined is what i am looking for,so that the if wud fail but say c is not defined, this code would just error out, but for the if clauses in the early statements 
solution: 

issue: you could use the lodash module to do that, if I'm understanding right. But I can't see how to don't get undefined when you step into a non existing method. Since in lodash, you can do [<-CODE->] But if one of the methods you step (let's say 'c') is undefined, you still would get undefined as return. Well, as I know, it dont error out, but it don't return the last defined variable/method either. You only get the value of the last item in the chain, and only if all of the methods in the chain are defined, else you return undefined.You could too define a default return for fail in this cases: [<-CODE->] And now, whenever theres something wrong in the chain, it will return 1 to the var. You could check if it can call a function instead 
solution:

issue: DylanPiercey: cool! Any plans to integrate with restify? DylanPiercey: the email is from letsencrypt? how does the auto-renew work? I use letsencrypt currently with pm2, so there's multiple workers loading the certificate... 
solution: 

issue: avimar: I am not super familiar with restify, does it expose a handler function of some kind? avimar: The auto renew works by checking the time the certificate was last modified when loaded and setting a timeout (safely) that will remove the certificate and get a new one after 80 days. As far as multiple workers go this is something I will have to look into, haven't played with this much yet in a multi process setup, although I will on monday. Hopefully I can come up with a simple ipc way the notify other processes that the cert has already been requested. avimar: Looks like restify does not expose a request handler. I may make it so that there are options for "http" and "https" createServer overrides since this would make the lib work with hapi, and also spdy and http2.

issue: what does that even mean node is a platform, not a shared library 
solution: 

issue: seanzer: node js it's implementation of common js. Electron uses it to work with system and uses webkit or blink, to render html 
solution: 

issue: MakanTaghizadeh: that doesn\'t make any sense. you bind a function\'s receiver ("this" value), and a promise is not a function 
solution: 

issue: the bind syntax should work, or use an arrow foo.prototype.fetch = function () { return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { resolve(this); }) } 
solution: 

issue: Anybody have in mind a package for checking existence of a binary in $PATH environment in node? E.g. I want to call some program viachild_processbut don't know is it installed on a system 
solution: ewnd9: I don't have a package in mind but I would usually use bash for that: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Edge reminds me so much of IE. Especially how their Chakra dev approach is similar to what they did with JScriptSo, ES6 spec is official and defines tail call optimization. While webkit already has it, in v8 it's still under dev (actually only open for someone to take on it, not under actual development)But then comes Chakra, where TCO is stillunder consideration. I mean, seriously, since it's in the standard, what are they considering about? Making Chakra standard compliant or not? 
solution: The "under consideration" part means they haven\'t decided yet whether to implement TOC or not (as per their own site). If it were about prioritization there would\'ve been a ticket/issue to prioritize, just as v8 has (accepted, but not started due to low priority). And even if chakra will eventually implement it, and it\'s just a matter of priority, I\'m still amused by the way they refer to it. 

issue: I use common.js in the root folder of various projects, which isn't committed to git. I have it loaded by nconf. VoidVolker: for dev, I have it as defaults... or my own common.js

issue: personally, I stick to LTS (4.x) 
solution: 

issue: Hmm, I don't get the project's purpose. Is it to replace having to write HTML markup and use JS instead? Choose whichever requires less debating 
solution: yes because HTML markup and even templates are boilerplate that's annoying to change in a modern application that's subject to change at any minute in my opinion. I personally stand for serving HTML instead of creating the entire page dynamically (which is slower, no caching, no optimization and requires much more resources).  [<-LINK->] the whole thing is like 4 line right now but I've realized that it comes with certain advantages. like there's no need to select elements or give them ids or classes when you already have access to them on creation. and maybe static HTML generation will be a feature. 

issue: linthum: also, if you have node installed, there is a project called learnyounode. It's on github I believe and you can install it through NPM.

issue: gts00k: nodeschool.io gts00k: then dont use it? 
solution: 

issue: Yup, I also do that for images e.g., however usually an app/site has some dynamic and some static pages. Even on dynamic pages you should notice a speed increase due to the faster routing. One thing I haven't benchmarked is how Aero behaves with let's say 100 middleware functions. That might be its weak point. However I don't think that's a realistic case. E.g. an earlier project that I first made with Express (my.nihongo-center.com) was peaking at around 50 req/s and when I moved it to Aero (took some time because the routing is different) it peaked at around 97-100 req/s. That's from a practical project at work, I believe it has around 5 or 6 middleware functions.

issue: World, please help me with this because I'm going crazy (just like in the avatar). I am trying to import a huge csv into Wordpress since 2 days. Using wp plugins it's painfully slow (I have 100,000 rows, it takes 10 minutes for 800 rows). Uploading through heidisql I get errors either with permalink or no category/no tags. I already have some solutions and ways to go about it but I can't implement them because it's beyond my programming expertise. I can pay by Paypal a sensible amount since I'm doing so bad on the finances side. Please send a direct message if you can help. Thank you!

issue: nVVEBd: run the app with nodemon instead of node and it will watch/restart accordingly ( [<-LINK->] ) 
solution: 

issue: jonyet: I have grunt-nodemon installed. nodemon is started and listens to changes. But if I change a file I still have to kill the process and restart it for the data to be pulled into my app.  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: nVVEBd: it sounds like maybe it's not setup correctly? i've only used bare nodemon and haven't touched grunt in years. perhaps the answer here (running it as a function task) will assist? [<-LINK->] the kanye is strong with@nVVEBd

issue: Hello to you too@Falieson. We'd appreciate more if you could also provide some context to your issue. Until then, my only guess is that you're probably looking forevent.target.dataset.name

solution: the only thing that could be considered "more the future" than node is maybe go, but i don\'t think that\'s necessarily true either.

issue: gts00k: skiena's book has algorithms in C, that's true, but in my opinion it's also the best for a gentle introduction to algorithms it takes time, you'll have to be patient it might worth it to actually spend some time learning C first, just the essentials, so that you can later move on with the book it won't happen from one day to another, and it might seem complicated now, but believe it or not, Skiena's material are , I believe, the absolutely essential for every programmer 
solution: 

issue: Is it possible for a node server to send a request that gets acknowledged by the client(app)? Will this work for the scenario I described above? 
solution: I mean it sounds like some core node fundamentals to me, based in you're description. you send a request from your server to an app, and you set an event to fire on receipt of that data. check the docs on setting up events/listeners.

issue: You don't get minification with this, nor replacing html scripts and it's not portable code simondiep: You could use this (inside your npm scripts): [<-LINK->] 
solution: Here's an articel that is in favour of npm scripts, but it also goes into the downsides with the approach. [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Looks like there are a lot of npm packages available for minifying.  Are there any for replacing html <script></script> ? 
solution: 

issue: Misconception #4: npm Scripts Don’t Run Cross-platformThis section basically goes on about how it runs cross-platform if you make it work cross-platform. How is that a misconception He also goes on about how npm has 227000 packages while grunt/gulp have less than 6000. This is also a non-argument, the vast majority of packages on npm are not designed for the command-line, so you can't use them in npm scripts 
solution: When I write html/js then I use browserify so I only have one script tag which points to my bundle.js file, so I have never needed to replace the script tags, so I can't help you there.. 

issue: (I wouldn't use jQuery. ;)) Alright, I think I have a good enough understanding of Express for now. Do you care for any more questions, or should I try again at a later time?

Basically I want an "upgraded" mongodb shell, so I canrequireutilities and whatnot But if I go into node's shell, I'll have torequire('mongodb')and then connect manually, etc. It would be convenient to have a startup script do that, and then send me to the shell Awesome thanks for the pointer@mpotra! 
solution: 

issue: Is anyone worried at all about NPM inc's future? I mean, hopefully they're making a profit, but it would seem that with 4 billion npm downloads a month, that's a LOT of bandwidth for few paying users Maybe worried was too strong of a word :P

solution: 

issue: Anyone know of a good library for adding debugging output to an app? I'm using [<-LINK->] right now, but I wanted something that I could add other tags or categories to or something the debug library only allows for the one. You can use wild cards, but thats a pita. Like if I have models, routes, controllers, then error/debug/info/warn levels for each of those.. that wouldnt be the easiest using debug abhisekp: does that output to the console as well? if needed; I like the how the debug lib just requires you to set the envDEBUGvar ah, yes, console logging 
solution: 

issue: only time I have run into that is when i\'m installing a package where the name of the package is the same as"name"in my package.json i've mistakenly done this when testing a package i've never used for in a directory named after the package and runningnpm init, not sure if that's the case here

solution: yeah reduce and then splice ?. that was awesome. 

issue: Hi guys. Is there a doc somewhere that covers converting Elastica ES query to NODE.js? 
solution: nVVEBd: that doesn’t mean anything. 

issue: 'exit' is only emitted explicitly byprocess.exit()or implicitly once the program finished executing sigterm is when the program receives a termination signal 
solution: no worries, not sure how they work together, or if you're meant to capture low level signals yourself, personally I would just rely on exit. 

issue: I have a CLI and a daemon that manages some services. CLI sends aSIGTERMto the daemon, the daemon should clear the PID lock, kill workers and exit. ended up withprocess.on('SIGTERM, doAllTheStuff); 
solution: 

issue: jonyet: SIGTERMis not an error. It's something (user, process/service manager) asking the app to shut down, gracefully. It can be ignored SIGKILLis when something is forcing your process to shut down, and it's mandatory (can't be ignored) 
solution: I would expect that to show something, but no dice.. 

issue: hey all, I've got a question. I'm spawning a child process to run commands and the process' stdout and stderr are both emitting the same thing, wondering if anyone can tell me why. here's the code  [<-CODE->] stderr and stdout are both receiving the same data at the same time 
solution: 

issue: hi all, right now my apps runnig with Node V4.3.0if i changes my node lastest version of V5.x its any some api broken on from v4 to v5? or should i have to waiting for Node V6? cause i hear node v6.x soon will be releasing? hi@ljharbthanks for fast response right now i dont event use ES6 features on my apps ljharb: what you recommendation for me? should i upgrate to v5 or just waiting for v6? and its any have performance improve for nodejs on v5 or v6 if i do upgraded now? sorry if my english so bad :)

solution: 

issue: anyone can help me debug why nodejs stops installing packages? or exits with a status ok but doesn't actually properly install anything I tried changing the log level but for the life of me I can't tell what's wrong not using any proxy or anything and disabling my firewall makes no difference :( 
solution: 

issue: you mean npm? rm -rf node_modules && npm installshould work 
solution: no error no warning nothing. 

issue: grunt globally? I don't use grunt but 
solution: so for example, this stops mid-progress :|.

issue: hi, how can i create rss feed for website that i dont have  [<-LINK->] ? 
solution: 

issue: Anyone have any preferred error/exception packages? was looking at [<-LINK->] , looks decent. 
solution: 

issue: Also, I just thought about how it does not even have to be the internalpreparemethod that calls this, it could also be that another one of your dependencies uses this module. It would also get the monkeypatched methods subfuzion: No problem I just love to discuss these things. I also think that one day the V8 Promise implementation should be faster and the debug support better, than I would prefer a promisifier that uses native promises. Then again, one day maybe everyone uses Promises anyway :D jhyland87: I just subclassErrormyself 
solution: 

issue: is there anyway to get Node to work with ES6 modules without Babel? 
solution: 

issue: why doesn't this work? [<-CODE->] so no "in progress" features would work? 
solution: 

issue: because the modules implementation in v8 is not complete yet 
solution: 

issue: vamsiampolu: nope, the loader spec is not finished yet, but I see v8 made some progress (latest commit 4 days ago) and they're removing the--harmony-modulesflag 
solution: 

issue: so is their really any reason to useimportinstead ofrequire, despite being cool and hip? i mean, so far there only seems to be drawbacks. you can't import dynamic strings, and you have to import at the top of the file 
solution: mpotra: @subfuzionif you like these kind of things go there [<-LINK->]. 

issue: more correct? It is a horrible debugging experience when you step through your real source with sourcemaps but debugger shows variables like__this2 
solution: hm, then you're not using the right debugger. but yes more correct because runtime semantics are infinitely more important than debuggability.. (and the more tests you add the less you need the debugger anyways). 

issue: Will node internal modules ever support async/await? [<-CODE->] ljharb: what nice and pretty and easy debugger do u suggest to use? 
solution: 

issue: it\'s not about "readonly object" tho, it\'s that require() is first-class, import is second-class so you can't useimportin expression position. first-class means it can be used in expression position - ie, it's a value. 
solution: 

issue: hi, I wanted to know your experience using Eclipse IDE for node. 
solution: 

issue: jhyland87: : I'm not much experienced in js, but why not throw (from core)? and make the restful api part translate it into http errors? jhyland87: : in such design I normally would expect the error codes translation in the adapter (here the restful API implementation). (i.e. I wouldn't throw http errors from library which has nothing to do with http) jhyland87: : in small project when noone would ever use this otherwise I think I'd go with passing the http errors and don't care that much, but i guess if you have multiple teams and so on, you'd need to design your own error codes/exceptions. restful API adapter would adapt those to http error codes, cli client would e.g. to process exit codes or something other. it means though more boilerplate. 
solution: 

issue: I had a question if I run node app.js from the command line, what is the first thing being called in the lib. I looked in process.js but could not find the entry for a node.js run? What I want to know is the "int main()" part in node 
solution: I figured the models should return empty elements, then the controllers or whatever other methods should decided if thats an error not. 

issue: subfuzion: the semi colon did work, so lame. 
solution: Semi-colon is still haunting devs since C days. 

issue: i agree with@simplysh 
solution: 

issue: abhisekp: What is so bad about this? [<-CODE->] 
solution: ==is an overhead view of the four horsemen of the apocalypse. implicit coercion is bad and if you rely on it, you're a bad programmer and you should feel bad. that is an actual argument.. 

issue: thefourtheye: that reason actually makes it the most implicit and prone to bugs of them all 
solution: 

issue: abhisekp: just do this: if (!xyz) ... gitter phone app, sorry not at computer 
solution: abhisekp: You are correct, but you're also mixing and matching things. If you should be returning integer values, then you should be returning an integer value unless there was an error.. that is just for checking a null or undefined value. And based on that some weird stuff can be done. I'm not returning anything in the snippet.. 

issue: Even Brendan Eich has expressed his regrets for just not making semi-colons expliclity not required in the language. Unfortunately, due to the gotchas with ASI, it's hard to recommend in good conscience not using semicolons to people for the very reason you ran into an issue. Guys like Trevor Norris who work on node core, have stated he can't unlearn adding semicolons as he switches back and forth from c++ and js, so what ends up happening for a lot of us -- even if we would prefer no semicolons at all -- is rather than frankensteining our code with inconsistent usage, we just make semicolons explicit everywhere. Frankly, for all the years I've spent with C/C++/C#/Objective-C/Java, semicolons are simply not an issue for me. But I realize I can't speak for everyone. And I do enjoy no semicolons with go code, although I'm constantly accidentally appending them and then having to catch myself and delete them.

solution: 

issue: well yeah but don't you need a plugin to run npm scripts in parallel? gulp does it automatically but don't get me wrong I love npm scripts and gulp can do some wild things 
solution: you don't need gulp for anything.. :Di haven't any need for parallel or gulp yet. But you're awesome. 

issue: disagreed I mean some tasks are just different like compiling sass or coffeescript. I use like 5 npm scripts on a project but my gulp task is doing things. plus I don't 'need' gulp. I want to use gulp. It has tons of plugins/functions that work together like checking if a file changed or writing sourcemaps it's a dev dependency anyway I don't get what the bad part about gulp is 
solution: atom still uses coffeescript too or do you hate atom too. yes, that's why i don't use atom. 

issue: Hey guys, a little question: What is best practise in js: declaring a function above or underneath a function call and does it have an influence on performance? yeah but if I understand hoisting correctly,  it would only effect functions declared like this, correct?var functionname = function(param){};

issue: are generators supported in node.js v5 ? I try to use Babel to transpile async/await syntax to generators, but it doesn't work without babel-polyfill I don't understand why I'd have to include babel-polyfill if generators are supported in node v5 
solution: jgoux: usebabel-preset-node5andbabel-preset-stage-3instead ofbabel-preset-es2015andbabel-polyfillif you want to transpile for node v5.x. 

issue: wanderer06: I think@gts00k's actually referring to the fact thata1000b1000should be processed to[1000, 1000]instead of[1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] 
solution: Actually I don't (unless I wantexponentialoperator as well), but I believepreset-node5didn't include async/await early on sostage-3was used (again, I suppose only).

solution: 

issue: Pastebinpromptfrominquirermodule Nvmd, found it on npm And I believe the error is because you're not defining any.catch()branch 
solution: 

issue: prompt has wrong argument order for promisify. Must be (err, data, cb). It has (data, cb). That's why you get data on reject try to use new Promise()

It considers a new array including 2 terms being [ [<-LINK->] , [<-LINK->] ] and [<-LINK->] ? rah, bug again it considers there is 2 terms in the array, one being 1 & 3 and one being the new 1 ? abhisekp: why does it push it to [3] and not to [ [<-LINK->] ,[3]] ? Because it reads [<-LINK->] .push as "push to index 1" ?

solution: 

issue: abhisekp: because i want to be able to run my dependencies' tests on my specific platform and configuration. it helps with debugging. why do you care whether npm has to host your tests or not? yes the latter is an arrow function so it can't benewed, it doesn't have its own binding forthis/super/arguments, and it can't have a lexical name binding (so it can't refer to itself) yes, with any arrow function

solution: i think@memeis right though. they're both pretty widely used. you just need to pick the db that you're comfortable with and gets the job done well.. 

issue: slimeball: What? MongoDb and MySQL are both used in "real projects" NoSQL vs SQL is not about what's easy, what you know better or whatever, it's about your project'sneed 
solution: 

issue: That is true. It's tough though. There doesn't seem to be one true solution. Half the time you're data is relational and the other half it isn't. I guess you could use two databases but that doesn't reduce complexity at all lol. 
solution: Your could use PostGresql which supports both. And I don't personally think it's about you data type, it's about how you'll need it and what kind of consistency you need. Mongo is much faster than MySQL if you don't need immediate consistency, and much much much much easier to scale..

issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36397950/how-to-send-file-over-tcp-in-one-time-in-nodejsI have a problem with sending file over TCP/IP using nodejs. It looks like the problem is a maximum buffersize. Please help me :) 
solution: If your only desire is to increase the buffer size so that you would receive the file into one singledataevent, then you're thinking of it wrong. If your file would have 500MB, based on your expectation, both the server and the client would have to allocated 500MB! into memory, just to satisfy the need of one singledataevent; which is obviously the wrong approach to data transfer.. 

issue: I am making a call to our server, a simpleGETcall usingrequestmodule. It works perfectly fine inPOSTMANbut i am gettingECONNREFUSEDwhile making calls from Node.What can be the issue? Anyone ?

solution: i put the cookie in jwt.io and i switch between hs256 and rs256, clearly the signature bit is different at the bottom depending on which.

solution: I meant, most computers are fast enough you really don't have to worry about scalability until you have to worryTrue. I can't argue with you there. It's just I've worked for a few companies who thought they wouldn't get more than 100 hits/minute. Now they have 33 Apache servers with PHP. 

issue: @calidionI don't think all the the web sites needs to be scalable.whoa! so not true 
solution: 

issue: Does Apache still use threads? Or did it adopt an event loop aswell? What I like about Apache is that you can install it as an NT service on Windows 
solution: 

issue: So, coroutines are better than promises in the instances where you need to share variables from multiple async sources co() is a good library and it encapsulates a context very nicely but it's not needed if shared context is not needed across multiple async operations I don't like that you have to try catch stuff thoughThat's the native mechanism of handling errors and exceptions in JS though. It's weirder to have a callback that checks if an error was passed into it or rather, it's like old school C code 
solution: That's the native mechanism of handling errors and exceptions in JS though. It's weirder to have a callback that checks if an error was passed into it or rather, it's like old school C codeFair enough. 

issue: But uncaught exceptions are, like, the best way of catching errors. If you let them bubble up, you actually see them! It's more dangerous to use code that's not exception safe.

Well the thing is I’m recoding the backend to node and I’m hitting a Cross Origin Error when I send an AJAX request from PHP to my Node route. thazinwin: you mean for Node or Nginx? I’m using a modified Mean for my backend. 
solution: 

issue: I used the cors module but since theres heavy proxying and routing behind the app I have to configure it with nginx and it’s reverse proxy managed to cone nginx - but now when starting the app [<-CODE->] yup 
solution: 

issue: i configure nginx to listen to 127.0.0.1:3000 port. Is that correct? since I want to send and recieve on this IP/port 
solution: 

issue: Yea, I didn’t say that it is not. Maybe there can be anoher approach. You can set quite short validity for JWT and generate new one during every request and send it with together with payload? 
solution: The other idea I had, is that the client would send the expectation of the resource to the server, and if that expectation is not met, the request fails. For instance, in my game if the player does a "spendCoin" api call, he\'d set a header saying he expects to have 50 coins, ask the server to spend 5, if the server sees his balance as not 50 coins, request denied. 

issue: those parameters are there for a reason. Instead, try reading bite size chunks of the file, or, maybe just don't JSON stringify it if you can. I know it's not an answer, but it's my two cents

issue: without Redis, how do you sync a NodeJS cluster so that when you post a msg on 1 node it will send the message to the subscribers on other nodes? 
solution: 

issue: I was thinking Redis for new messages subscription and a SQL or Cassandra backend for storage.I like Cassandra for the eventually consistent side. I currently run an Airbnb like system for p2p car renting, it uses MariaDB + Galera, and I hate the quorum thing where many servers would just sit and wait if separated from other servers.

The goal is that anywhere, in any service, I can correlate an error or event back to an initiating http request. Is there a known practice for doing this with Node? I'd like to avoid passing a context around through virtually every function call. stack overflow question to go with that if anyone has thoughts: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Don't you need to pass thethisvariable down into function 2? So [<-CODE->] That// undefinedisn't supposed to be there obviously but you get the point 
solution: if you want to pass context to a function invoked by itself and not as a member function, you needfunc2.call(this). butfunc2(this)is the same asfunc2(undefined)(if insidefunc1()), becausethisinsidefunc1()is alsoundefined.

issue: Anyone able to help / point me in the direction for figuring out what I’m doing incorrectly to get mocha to run?? Driving me crazy. I’ve run through all the tutorials I can handle, and backed out and in and all around but… I had it working in the same file folder last night! 
solution: I’ve only used it twice for a class so I’m just not familiar with it. When I ran mocha yesterday I would get back a list of all of the codes I was “solving” - which I got wrong or right and info about each. Now I run it and it responds as though I’m simply running a saved .js file (in this case, I’m getting a simple syntax error). 

issue: Is your spec not running? Or is there an error?

solution: 

issue: Is v6 rc out yet? 
solution: yeah i don't see it yet. 

issue: Wow, they really can't seem to make up their mind. 
solution: 

issue: ljack: why do you need this? Can't you just import it in the regular way 
solution: on your string before you eval it. ljack: if you import it (regular way) it would be executed, though. 

issue: ljack: does this work? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: This wont work because Node does not support ES6 modules yet 
solution: 

issue: you need to use bable for this to work 109C: no Idea

issue: Hi,I have a query in httpuppercaserer module in nodejs How is "request.pipe(map(function(chunk){return chunk.toString().toUpperCase()})).pipe(response)" is different from request.pipe(transStream).pipe(response); [<-CODE->] the second block of code does not work while the first one does any help is  greatly appreciated 
solution: 

issue: Hey everyone, someone to help me a bit about node.js / ejs ? Might be really easy but I'm just new to it .. :-/ 
solution: 

issue: Actually, I have data from my mongo db that I can get into an array in my nodejs but I just don't know how to display it in my .ejs file :'( 
solution: 

issue: As much as I like node, a survey made by a node.js consortium can't be truly objective 
solution: 

issue: specifically that has aSymbol.iteratorproperty that's a function that returns an object with anextmethod. when you say "container" do you mean a monad? Set and Array are both collections i suppose Map is too 
solution: 

issue: I'm not familiar with C++, but I'll guess it's what Java calls a Collection 
solution: 

issue: Anybody have any idea how to pass a variable into a.match()regex statement?  [<-CODE->] Use case: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] abhisekp: It returnstypeofas object and logging theblockitself returnsnull. I can't perform.toString()on it or anything. 
solution: 

issue: glyden: that's exactly how u write a regex pattern injecting patterns from variables in it. glyden: coz it doesn't match to anything. Check in [<-LINK->] btw,typeof null == 'object' // true:D u need some regex fixing 
solution: abhisekp: I think my Regex got skewed through several copy/pastes... And I have been trying to solve this for hours.... 

issue: Is this ok? [<-LINK->] ... the solution never print :( no :( TypeError: Cannot read property 'query' of undefined done.[Error: Pool is closed.]connected. because I call .end? 
solution: so... I must checking all queries... and when are done I must call .end for pool?. 

issue: does the process end instantly? k probablly error is set pool.getConnection(function(err, connection) {console.log(err)} now u need to  findout why the pool is closed

issue: Is there a way to make an api route only available from my app? 
solution: 

issue: lenonineking1199: fwiw my proposal for String#padStart/padEnd is likely going to make the language next month. 
solution: 

issue: Saying, "it wasn\'tthatbad" doesn\'t sound like a credible defense to me. The proliferation of unstandardized micro-modules, in my mind, is not as good as languages with larger, more robust standards 
solution: Truth be told, I\'m not even asking for wide-spread standardization. It\'d just be nice if "basic" things like common string manipulations were part of the standard instead of people relying on a ridiculously small module.Like, I\'d never expect Ramda to be standardized but padding strings, maybe.. 

issue: If they remain that way for some time, sure. But if you release the best software ever ade by man, it won't be popular overnight It's an interesting topic IMO, because to me, popularity is an important quality of what I'm looking for in a tech (community, libraries, support, etc.), but it's a chicken and egg problem 
solution: 

issue: but strings in JS are immutable and string manipulation is very common thing.What did u actually meant by "most string manipulation is a code smell"? 
solution: indexing into either strings or arrays is bad too.. 

issue: Looks like it's not able to find fs. Did you do a proper installation of node ? Myp: 
solution: 

issue: Myp: u were testing a cat. And according to human rights org., it is illegal. Was thereplace.jsonfile an actual [<-LINK->] file or a script? gallexme: u can run   but you can't hide ;)hi 
solution: abhisekp: just used it to test if the bug is viable to report to gitter. 

issue: anyone know what hash the v6.0.0 rc3 was built from? 
solution: 

issue: uh guys, the windows 10 issue with key input. I don't think it has like anything to do with the node update. what do you peeps think? 
solution: funny part is it WAS working a few days ago.. 

issue: im jumping into a new language by writing a game engine on it :) 
solution: 

issue: is  v6 stable release today?can't wait to use! 
solution: 

issue: curl -sL [<-LINK->] | sudo -E bash -I do this and then install sudo apt-get install nodejs, it is installing 0.10 version is that right? i am new to node! 
solution: morpheyesh: don't install node with apt, ideally.. morpheyesh: I recommend [<-LINK->]. 

issue: It such a shame JS doesn't let you choose between passing by reference and by value... 
solution: That\'s some useful pedantry, is what that is. "These two pointers live at different places on the stack, gosh!" when all people care about is the mutation of the derference.... 

issue: I found this [<-LINK->] :D 
solution: 

issue: rocksynth: that doesn't make any sense, why reinvent the wheel when you can use those dependencies to build evenbettertools? IMO you should write as little code as possible and leave it up to third party packages to do the grunt work. Like lodash for example. 
solution: From my own experience, I’ve been using Gulp and jQuery for a long time but never fully understood JavaScript. Which I totally regret putting off learning.. 

issue: RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceededis pretty descriptive of the error, your call stack is full Each time you enter a function, it goes on the stack, your stack has a limited size and thus you can't do an infinite recursion Iteration is almost always better than recursion for this very fact (and less argument passing and stuff) (And the Church–Turing thesis tells us any recursion can become an iteration) I think it's a reference to binaries that you can simply run, since you can't run TypeScript or whatnot 
solution: 

issue: The only usage I can think of is argument forwarding But that may not even apply to JS 
solution: 

issue: Hmm... Is your front-end written in Angular? 'Cause that's the only kind of momentum I can't get behind Fun fact though, conservation of angular momentum is very relevant for photon absorption in electron clouds! 
solution: HAHAHAHA +1 For the fun fact Physics :wink2:. Does this link help?http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13649972/how-to-set-maximum-http-client-connections-in-node-js.

issue: Someone from an AngularJS booth at a convention told me crawlers run the JS 
solution: some crawlers run the JS. Nepoxx: I think they mean No JS.. 

issue: Wouldn't the clients who turn off JS not be able to use your app regardless of where the logic is done? Since they can't perform HTTP requests as well?  April 27, 2016 11:48 AMAren't you talking about clients who turn off JS? 
solution: "turning off JS" is just to give you a sample of what real users experience when .js files fail to load, for example. I should simulate network throttling more to better design my UIs. 

issue: hhvm's still my go-to choice in those regards that, combined with nginx, is a combo I like (we got plenty of "legacy" php stuff)_ and AFAIK, php7 is still not as fast as hhvm 
solution: 

issue: No need to modify your code, me thinks 
solution: 

issue: What do you mean by vertical scalability? Are my problems now two dimensional? 
solution: 

issue: Nepoxx: You're using a JS transpiler right? 
solution: For Aurelia yes, for my rest server no. you should be. transpiler output runs faster than native.. I think he means the overall JS. No comments and whitespace would be in the outputed JS file. 

issue: can i share buffer object between javascript and native addon that write by c++? ex: c++ addon：void setBuffer(const v8::FunctionCallbackInfo<v8::Value>& args) {    Isolate isolate = args.GetIsolate();    char jsBuffer = node::Buffer::Data(Local<Object>::Cast(args[0]));    memcpy(jsBuffer, "bbbbbbbbbb", 10);    printf("native addon output:%s\\n", jsBuffer);}javascript:var native = require(\'nativeAddon\');var globalBuffer = new Buffer(20).fill(\'a\');native.setBuffer(globalBuffer); //set globalBuffer to \'bbbbbb....\', using memcpyconsole.log("js output:" + globalBuffer);//////////////////////////////////////////result:native addon output: bbbbbbbbbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaajs output: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa////////////////////////////////////////but, globalBuffer not change, why? backsapce: the code can output  the right result backsapce: when the js code run in electron, can't  get right result;

solution: 

issue: Out of curiosity, for those using docker, do youCOPYyour node_modules into your docker, or do you runnpm iinside your docker? Yeah, that's what I do as well, it lowers my dependency on npm.org, means I don't need npm on my image and whatnot, however docker's not very good at understand whether my node_modules folder changed or not 
solution: 

issue: i got to copy, as my docker images have no access to gcc/and or internet as some of the node modules need to compile 
solution: 

issue: What happens with buffered data in a Writable stream when it is unpiped? Thx 
solution: 

issue: Heya guys. I'm looking at [<-LINK->] Well actually [<-LINK->] It's amazing, learning new things about ES6. Correct me if I'm wrong but... Shouldn't [<-CODE->] be [<-CODE->] ? I mean the function has the index argument but the key of the returned object is just 'index', not referring to the argument 'index'. 
solution: 

issue: seanzer: Thanks for the advice. I have registered have have my Wrike key. I’ll have a look at the link you sent me in the morning. 
solution: 

issue: So I’m trying to deploy a server. I built a WP site on my localhost and it works perfectly. I did a “-v” for a local directory. However, I wanted to build an img so I can download it onto the host server. So i created a new clean wp container and linked it to the old DB and then did a “docker cp” and put all the files into the container. I then did a “docker commit”, “docker push” & “pull”… I found on the host server that the files aren’t actually there…. However, the new container on my local host has the files and it has no mounted volumes. I did a “docker exec” into it and I can see the files there, yet they aren’t on the img i made from it. I’m a bit confused. I know I can make a data volume and link that but I’m trying to just cp the files into the container so I’m only running 2 containers. … any idea what I’m doing wrong? 
solution: 

issue: You should user a Dockerfile instead of building your images "manually", first of all Volumes are container specific and specified at container creation volumes are NOT linked to the image, if you create a new container from an image, you will have to specify the volumes yet again, that's when docker-compose comes in handy Dynamodb? 
solution: 

issue: dont know anything about those dbs buthash/id of the image inside the advert? 
solution: 

issue: The only place where I use==isfoo == null, which always and only evaluates tofoo === null || foo === undefined also, xo style prefersBoolean()to!! 
solution: yeah,== nullis the only non-repulsive use of==. hmm, i might switch to it from xo since you enforce preferring const :). 

issue: so front end to angular to express to mongo  right. still where does node fit in? what exactly is node tangibly..i know npm is the command line interface. is node js similar to that? idk what lgri is talking about huh 
solution: 

issue: Hey all! Need some guidance on unit testing for Node (and client-side with Angular) Would anyone be willing to answer a few questions or walk through it with me? konato: thank you for that. I was trying out Jest and I think the article linked in the article you linked (haha - yeah THAT'S not confusing) was really great and swayed me toward Tape. I'll give it all a shot! :-) 
solution: 

issue: ChristianMMacy: Hi, I'm at the same point, I plan to use Tape to test my Apis, I found this article to [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: in scripts in packages.js  I see  commands like  "start":npm run build  what is defffernce between start : npm run build and  start: build ? mpotra: thanks 
solution: 

issue: There's actually this really amazing front-end JS framework, it's called Vanilla JS: http://vanilla-js.com/It's actually the most performant and minimal front-end framework. Guaranteed best performance in the right hands and with the most minimal overhead. 
solution: 

issue: my next resume will just look like one of those word cloud things 
solution: 

issue: "Hi, I\'d like to add you to my professional network..." 
solution: 

issue: Just a quick confirmation. When you require a file/module, the stuff not exported is still ran? 
solution: Nepoxx: So if im creating connections to DB for example its only connected one time even if i require many times?. 

issue: Why isprependListener'not a function' in node 6.0? I want it available on an emitter made global Is it something to do with inheritance? I'm just instantiating it asglobal.Emitter = new EventEmitterbutprependListeneris a no-go there 
solution: 

issue: Hi all, Im trying write a wrapper for thedocker-composecli usingchild_process.execthis is what I got so far [<-LINK->] Problem is that Im running intostty: stdin isn't a terminalwhich I’m not sure what it is. Any idea what that error is? 
solution: 

issue: that's AngularJS for example with local data (json, xml..etc.) Node is still server side if used from client 
solution: 

issue: I'm leaning towards having multiple instances, load balancing with nginx in front, that way I can sort-of do rolling deployments Right Also@mattymilI'll look into it, their page isn't very good at explaining the bigger picture. Is it something like OpenStack? Well actually we have legacy php crap so Apache is doing all the work 
solution: I used Angular 1 extensively, I prefer Aurelia. That being said, I never tried React, Vue, Meteor (which is quite different). I toyed with Amber some, it was okay.. 

issue: man these sql modules are not my favorite. the struggle is real 
solution: It's like driving a Maserati to a grocery store.. 

issue: So I have a module: [<-CODE->] and when I require it like this it work fine: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Ok, so arrow functions cannot be used as constructors apparently. 
solution: Yes, because their context is bound to the calling one. A constructor would be a privatized context, I think. 

issue: What version are you on? v6? 4.4.3 is currently LTS 
solution: Yeah so basically when I do projects for myself (I don't plan on sharing the code), I use v6's features. If I wanna write something for more versions I'd use babel. just in transpiler you use babbel or typescript or others?. 

issue: i'm using babel with 4.4.3 so i can write es6 - its' fine 
solution: 

issue: texirv0203: I don't think, that there is exactly what you want, but try to start with package njstrace.But why do you need it for? 
solution: 

issue: Does node v6 natively support import, or do I need babel to do it? Also... I can't use import on say... express, can I? I still need commonJS for that 
solution: or import express. 

issue: also NaN is part of IEEE 754. so it's not JS's fault. lots of langs have NaN. Egoscio: @jnvmES6 modules don't exist yet. nothing supportsimport/exportyet. also never use any harmony flags, ever

solution: 

issue: hey guys i have a question related to to this issue  [<-CODE->] Of? Node? okay actually what i had to do was this one 
solution: you need to use babel.. don't use--harmony, ever. Egoscio: and@ljharbthanks. 

issue: affansadiq: What version are you using? This [<-LINK->] says that older versions of node require the --harmony argument. (for ES2015 features of course) 
solution: 

issue: so what can I do to get a job being a dev lolCreate an online portfolio of projects that you've accomplished. Also, choose decently complex and intensive projects to complete. Hello world programs aren't all that impressive these days. That's not always true. What I filled my github with is not what I do for a living. 
solution: JK, XML is pretty cool too. It just has a nasty little learning curve.. 

issue: at least you're using Nan! 
solution: 

issue: So, did Facebook start off that way or did they make Hack from get-go?

solution: Mongodb can get real messy real quick. I once had a little DB powering my custom blog, and it just corrupted itself after time. Hogging 100% CPU. Like wtf. 

issue: Hi, I'm looking for a good site about Socket.io. I've been reading the official Docs but I'm stuck. I need something more human. Could you help me? 
solution: jmendozav: The most important part is just hooking it up to your existing server setup (In my case, I usually attach it to my express server instance), then you can emit and receive events with a data payload attached.. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] it doesn't happen with other functions or plain variables, only bound methods, and it happens with any bound method if you pass in anyreq.foo = f.bind(o)for any f and o, you get this error when you delete it, it works again for example [<-CODE->] version 6.0.0 the thing is that all of the code still runs correctly, for example if i runreq.f2in the above snippet and check the output viaconsole.log, it is working as expected 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys, I'd be really grateful if someone could check out my post when they can. Really stuck on it at the moment :/ [<-LINK->]

solution: 

issue: brandonjfajardo: “What have you worked on that’s in production? What did you contribute? Why does it matter?" 
solution: 

issue: What’s the problem?@Shivamnema05 If he’s using the code here: [<-LINK->] 
solution: then it looks like you would run node ./index.js and then open chat.html in your browser. Looks like you’ll have to change the IP’s too, from ‘1.2.3.4’ to localhost. 

issue: Okay. One more thing...I read at many places.. that i need install install npm express on the specific folder. though when i do this it all install but did not have any folder in there. bjackson: 
solution: 

issue: I'm using ubuntu 16.04. Is apache is pre-installed with it? 
solution: That's an old SO post, so I doubt if it still works (although I assume it should). I changed port to 8000 and above pic probably says that the chat.js is running. 

issue: got google? u ppl dont even google 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys, it's been a year or so since I've worked actively with Nodejs. Looking to build a CMS. I worked with Express in the past. One of my coworkers had said that Express is dead. Is this true and if so what framework is the most widely used/supported framework for Node? my coworker mentioned happy? haven't looked into it. yeah maybe that was it hahah 
solution: 

issue: yeah, node 6 has everything except modules: [<-LINK->] i think using just rollup would suffice 
solution: 

issue: ES6 modules don't exist yet, anywhere. 
solution: 

issue: Any body wit git experience while hosting node.js application? 
solution: 

issue: Does babel even optimize const? Only thing I can imagine it doing is making the set property of variables throw an error when redefined after declaration (if that's even a thing, I know defineProperty works for Objects...) Or maybe my understanding of const isn't complete. designfrontier: I wouldn't be surprised, as optimizing stuff like that isn't really up to the preprocessor afaik. Lame but expected... 
solution: 

issue: guys serious question, does rails solve any problems that node can't? there's a lot of comprehensive tutorials out there and I would like to expand my skills good call 
solution: 

issue: guys serious question, does rails solve any problems that node can't?Whoa, man, you should never be looking for reasons to not learn a language. Learn everything that you can. Don't dedicate your life to it but at least learn enough to truly discern whether it's for you or not :) 
solution: 

issue: okay, third time\'s the charm! I have an express app that has the functionfunction isLoggedIn(req, res, next){\n    if(req.isAuthenticated()){\n        return next();\n    }\n    res.redirect("/login");\n};and it works great. but I want to pass the information that a user is logged in to my index.ejs so that I can display certain content depending on whether you\'re logged in or not! I\'ve tried passing it through as a variable but it doesn\'t work. do I need to re-write the function? Egoscio: like have the function store the result as a variable you mean? i'm pretty new to all of this by the way :D 
solution: And then say you're using Jade and you want to pass the info into your view.... 

issue: Anyone here familiar with React Router? 
solution: 

issue: designfrontier: haha! I basically just need to pass json or variable from my server side controller to a route. Do I need to make an API call to it? designfrontier: do you have any other recommendations for single page apps? D: Is that simple enough to embed in an existing app? Just the view end, but I would like to do some server side rendering too Currently using Jade to render everything 
solution: 

issue: I was gonna say, one thing that was jarring to me when coming from PHP to Node was the idea of choosing my own view or templating engine. In a lot of ways, I feel the Node HTTP servers took a step back. 
solution: I mean node out of the box isn’t even an http server. You can right a server for any TCP protocol with node. Which isn’t ever happening with PHP. Express/et al use the builtin http server. But you could just as easily write a IRC server in node. 

issue: PHP is a very high level abstraction, where you give up a lot of freedom in exchange for not having to make decisions. Node is much lower level. You gain lots of freedom in exchange for making more choices.This is by far the most reasonable and level-headed thing I've ever seen anyone ever say about PHP O_oThank you, sir. 
solution: 

issue: It actually does look look, builds everything up and refreshes the app & browser too look sweet* Anyway off now guys, thanks a lot for your help! 
solution: no problem! Welcome to a wider world :-). 

issue: Yeah, all that new-fangled imperative and functional programming with a task queue... Actually, I don't hate the  future. I wholeheartedly embrace it. I just have foresight and wisdom about the future. Granted, everything I learned was from old fogies who hate the future so they've forever skewed my perspective. 
solution: I learned from old fogies too. Just like everyone else that’s any good at programming.. 

issue: loooooool the techempower benchmarks. we're getting memed here, folks 
solution: 

issue: What would be the best way of handling a kind of message queue where I send a message from my express server to my client over sockets, and need to wait for that message to be done (it runs animations) before sending another item from the queue? Right now I just emit a 'complete' message back to the server but this breaks if the client is closed or not available at all 
solution: 

issue: xeoneux: @stefdaems_twitterAny reason not to use node-resemble? 
solution: stefdaems_twitter: I know it's possible using OpenCV and there are node bindings for the same.... xeoneux: yes indeed, but than the comparison is made based on histogram, I want to perform it pixel by pixel. I'm not sure whether this is possible on with opencv, pixel by pixel comparison. 

issue: looking for some schooling on promises and error catching i have, [<-LINK->] and if i throw inside the anon function scope, the error is not caught i have to use reject in order for my catch statement to work 
solution: In this case, you need to call the cb with the error otherwise you're just throwing an error in an isolated context that never passes the error along.. 

issue: uptownhr: there's a difference between the async error handling and throwing the exception synchronously. Your setTimeout throws an exception that can't be caught by the promise, so it should take in a rejection callback and use a try/catch to pass it along 
solution: 

issue: nikhiljha: MongoDB is schema-less so you can just start inserting records as JSON documents. dondre: just easy to prototype with. Postgre is better technically. dondre: think about it like C vs ASM

issue: zheldibayev: They do fundamentally different things. What are you using your WAMP stack for? 
solution: 

issue: How come EventEmitters stack into causing a memory leak? Im emitting something on loading a page and retrieving it in my socketIO file, and emitting a socket request.  EventEmitter.once works just fine, but thats wierd O.o Ah I see. So using .once shouldn't cause any problems right? I reference it 
solution: 

issue: Is 40 MB a lot? That might also actually just be V8 itself too. 
solution: 

issue: It depends on how your user application consumes your apis. Not on the relationship itself 
solution: ^ indeed. okok thankyou. 

issue: Like for a user with a relation to a project, the user is referenced as I dont always need full user data on calling a project 
solution: 

issue: mpotra: Isn't there usually an error argument in callback functions for DB queries? Just like: [<-CODE->] 
solution: It is. It's(err, value), andlevelup.get, passes an error and setserr.notFoundproperty totrueif the key was not found. Btw, you can safely useparseInt(what)without specifying the base argument, which will always default to base 10; so there's no weird behaviour in nodejs if you don't set it..

solution: dhavaldenny: I mean... you can get hosting from [<-LINK->] for 5 bucks, but it's not that much ram. It kind of depends on what you're planning to do, but I don't think you can get that far off a shared host.. 

issue: Personally, I don't think MEAN is really that necessary for ecommerce. Things like [<-LINK->] , [<-LINK->] , or [<-LINK->] are more suited for your case, unless you have a very specific demand that the existing platforms do not fulfill, and you or someone else would be willing to code it.

issue: robots will run on node.js amanuel2: wants robots to run on node.js 
solution: 

issue: Node is basically a program that parses JS and turns it into machine instruction. The Node runtime is capable of acting as a HTTP server.npmwill basically download all the packages in the package.json files so your locally running instance of Node can see the code in the modules and run it. I wonder if I butchered that... #yolo 
solution: morph-eus: if you are familiar with Java then you can think of node basically as the jvm. other then that as long as that reference sticks around it’s going to be hard to cleanup from outside your event system. 

issue: morph-eus: You have two options. You can either add a [<-LINK->] and invoke it directly, or you can run scripts using the node executable. ie:node ./start.js(does not require shebang). If you\'re working in production, I recommend using a process manager (depending on your scenario), but that\'s out of the scope of your question. As for package.json, yeah, as@LeonineKing1199said, it\'s for NPM. The "main" that you define in your package.json is like the starting point of your module, but I think it defaults to index.js. morph-eus: index.js should usually be the heart of your app or module. If you're making a module you can define a custom entry point in package.json If you're making a new node project, I recommend making a .js file in a project directory and then, in this directory, do npm init it will give you options for configuring your package.json automatically, so you don't have to remember the field values. (I had a similar problem when I was new too) Grab a raspberry pi, some motors, install a gpio module and hack on.

I've been experimenting with the STL more and it seems like just so long as you write a container and give it a good iterator implementation, the STL will honestly do almost all the work for you.

issue: Consider this, your code will probably never be the reason why it's slow.  Making AJAX calls is slow compared to how fast a CPU can process but there's literally nothing you can do in your code to fix that. Not unless you shake your internet cables really hard to force more internet through. 
solution: You might be better off optimizing your algorithm to not even need to make an AJAX request, for example. This is why Node's event loop is so successful. It turns those otherwise idle CPU cycles into something productive..

issue: @catharsisjelly @LeonineKing1199  I find that to be the most consistent and complete approachI know theres a problem when I expect it to work and it doesn't. What scares me more is not knowing when it shouldn't work and it still does. If that makes sense.

issue: i think i've asked this before but will I get burned for only knowing the basics of node and just using express? I understand what's happening under the hood but I don't think it's necessary to dive any deeper streams, buffers, the event emitter, etc is nice to know but it's just not practical I feel 
solution: 

issue: brandonjfajardo: Chances are you won\'t really need them unless you\'re doing something a module on NPM can\'t do. In that case, you would have to learn those fundamental "under the hood" tools. With the exception of, say, the properties of an event emitter instance. (simple ones like.on) If you're making a server that uses websockets, and you're dealing with socket.io or similar, you will find yourself using a lot of eventemitter instance properties, depending on the task at hand. but that's ez pz Or take crypto. I'm not a big cryptographer, but when I want to generate random query string tokens, I use node's crypto

solution: 

issue: that is why i used.constructornormally, but i didn't really think about how it could be faked...  but i don't really see where someone would intentionally fake it just to break my modules (where it would error anyways).  i guess i can see where there are valid cases though. 
solution: Honestly, JS is all about duck typing. The goal is to create a safe property accessor method. Fighting against the looseness of JS is silly because it goes against what JS is. If you want strong typing, use a different language..

"potentially would" and yes, in this case, v8 can know that "a" and "b" are only used in "c" so altho v8 won't touch Buffer.concat, if it was, in fact, internal, then it certainly could know that it should make those arrays intocinline *buffers then sure, it can't do much about that but if you're touching the filesystem, you've kind of already tanked your perf, no? try/catch is really hard. all i'm really saying is that JS is fast.whyit is fast is none of my concern, i'm not an engine implementor

(Just curious as I've not done this in Node yet, I consider Node just for quick stuff rather then core domain/business logic) LeonineKing1199: http calls for distributed systems? That's not exactly async

issue: Hey guys check my site im doing with node  [<-LINK->] u can play pokemon too 
solution: 

issue: I'd say just a POST, since you are creating a new SMS request; not sure though 
solution: yeah looks fine. or just a plain 200. 

issue: It could be relying on context, is my first gut instinct. Oh, I see it now. You're using broadcast before you've defined it. If this was C++, the compiler would've screamed at you and slapped you in the face with a compilation error. And then with a wet noodle. Well, maybe like 'var', JS does some hoisting. Regardless, both are terrible practices and you should never use a variable before it was defined. 
solution: For example,1337 < new Date()is perfectly valid and just returnsfalsein all cases.. 

issue: Hey, hope somebody can help me with this..Currently having an issue with "phantom" object properties [<-LINK->] setting a breakpoint during execution, and printing the object will show all properties correctly.

I am static linking the same stuff that the dll does but it does not work On linux it works with static linking , on windows it does not seem so 
solution: I posted an SO question and I will bount it when I can if I don't get any answers. At least i got the thing working for now.

solution: 

issue: For building an API? I think Backbone is a front-end framework. Node\'s kind of confusing because there\'s a lot of stuff that\'s written that needs to be "browserified" 
solution: But as for general API design, the best ones are ones that hard to use incorrectly and are self-documenting.. There are a ton of HTTP frameworks in the Node ecosystem..

issue: "It is important to keep in mind that spawned Node.js child processes are independent of the parent with exception of the IPC communication channel that is established between the two. Each process has it\'s own memory, with their own V8 instances. Because of the additional resource allocations required, spawning a large number of child Node.js processes is not recommended." 
solution: Hmm, I guess they're both basically the same with some different features. I've never used WebWorkers so I wouldn't know, but my main reason for using it was to isolate some code in it's own thread to make it faster.. 

issue: hey@all, I have complicated question. I can't understand it and found solution.  I'm professional, I have deep knowledges in IT and science and people very often ask my advise in IT or in something near. So, I found solution and give correct and best answer. But very often people not follow advise and do something other. Why? Why people asking my advise about something I know very well and immediately forget it? Why people need knowledge and not use it? Why people asking me found solution of they issue/problem and not use it, when I found? I can't understand. I'm very interesting. Why? I know. But why they ask? 
solution: 

issue: VoidVolker: why not ask them? :)

issue: Bull looks like a job manager, not a means of achieving concurrent execution of tasks. There is awebworker-threadsmodule but honestly, it seems pretty anemic. And sharing data between threads is pretty ugly. I'd just write a separate service that you call out to from Node. Node's for I/O bound tasks, not compute-bound ones. I guess that would work too... I wonder which is faster, inter-proccess communication with a C++ process or spawning a child Node process and doing all your compute on tha.t Well, Node does have a background thread pool which it'll toss tasks onto. And a lot of other lower-level modules interact directly with V8 Honestly, what are you actually trying to do?

You know, back in my day, we use$_GETand weliked it! You really can't. If you're keeping your DB in the RAM, you kind of get what you deserve, is my opinion. I've heard of places doing this and they use things like uniterrupted power supplies just in case. I mean, just don't ever unplug the server, basically. 
solution: If you're keeping your DB in the RAM, you kind of get what you deserve, is my opinion.But redis tho. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-LINK->] why doesn’t this pair work? 
solution: 

issue: thetempfolder contains apackage.json, I want to point to that folder remotely, and have the dependencies mentioned in thatpackage.jsoninstalled into anode_modulesfolder next to thepackage.jsonin thetempfolder I will have to resort to using.chdirbut that doesn't change the fact that the command produces wildly different results on Windows than on Unix I'm wanting to have just the latest dependencies (not devDeps) installed in a node_modules folder) so I can zip up the whole thing as a package for our deployment team but I can't run that from the project folder, because the build script relies on devDeps so I need to make a temp folder for the production version of the app, then zip the temp folder 
solution: 

issue: so my first deployment seems not to run.  I run command sudo node app.js and the first line is a console.log, but I see nothing and the ps there is nothing 
solution: I make that assumpetion because I saw you doing Express stuff earlier..

issue: So I used Js and node for a while up until node v 0.10 and around when io.js was forked. And haven't touched it much since. And now is on v6 and most people are doing es6. Can anyone point me in the right direction on trying to start new projects using es6 properly? I'm not as familiar with that new syntax as much. Arrow functions look weird lol Thanks guys Yea at work were starting a project in node so I need to catch up 
solution: 

issue: what do endpoints /set /get mean? more specifically PUT, /setGET, /get ahh ok since i am using express there is no put correct? 
solution: 

issue: with es6 and node v6, Do I need to compile js down to still use it or is just es6 fine? It is only an api so i dont need anything in the browser ah. does anyone use web storm? ive enabled es6 support and set it to the project. but at the top of the file i have aconst ...and i get an error with jslintunexpected const yea i get the same error  [<-CODE->] i get it at that first const does jslint in webstorm even support it? if i disable jslint and just use eslint, it still give me warning in other areas properly but that const error goes away yea, i just disabled it. i had that and eslint both enabled.

issue: who needs mongo, when there’s postgresql postgresql has nosql... 
solution: 

issue: This is starting to make a weird code smell. Why so focused on versions? O_o Well, that's oddly pacific. Hmm... I know you were talking about writing your own HTTP server and I'm assuming you're trying to rip out Node's native one and replace it with yours. But it sounds like your code is freakishly implementation-defined which is always worrisome. Ah, I see. So you're using Python now? Lol I made a funny. So then what are you doing that'sthatimplementation-defined? 6.4.0 will properly expose the promised dependencies on Windows for addonsWell, there's your problem right there :P How do you feel about Google's C++ guide? Lol slam I was gonna say, you should just apply to google. I've heard that the guy who wrote that regrets that decision. I've also heard part of it was because they didn't have the resources to update all their previously existing code. Oh. Well the. Yeah? And did you just choose like "super duper amazing/the best ever?" One thing that I thought was weird, they lifted the ban onstd::forward Which made me wonder, why would you banstd::forwardin the first place? That's disappointing, man. That means you can't implementemplaceoremplace_backfor custom classes. I couldn't imagine working for google and not being able to understand rvalue references and/or reference collapsing. 
solution: 

issue: (I have no clue what they are)You know how Rust kids are always talking about "borrowing" and "ownership"? It\'s just like that, only done manually and not enforced by the compiler itself. Which, I admit, is a point in Rust's column.

solution: 

issue: I must be evil, I think side-effects are good sometimes. For example, I have a function that mutates a matrix in-place (turning it into a permutation matrix) and returns the number of row swaps that happened. I think is entirely preferable to returning a pair or a tuple because they're awkward to work with, imo. 
solution: 

issue: ljharb: It just creates a potential maintenance issue, which any code does. If my code throws an exception at least it warns of the problem instead of becoming a larger one. Then it is just a matter of renaming that method and other code depending on it until that dependent code can be changed to work correctly with the new method, which hopefully does something similar. Any function you make could later become part of the language or a framework you use. It's the same thing. LeonineKing1199: Yes, I could do assert(!some_condition); I'm looking for a built in function or popular library that makes the ! into the word false. like assert.not(my_truthy_condition)

issue: foxjazz: I used to love C#. It was my favorite language. I liked so many things about it. After many years of growing, I eventually I "outgrew" the language when I wrote an awesome ORM like thing, but had to really wrestle with the language itself to get it to be awesome.

issue: hi guys I’ve been using generators using bluebird in node should I get rid of bluebird and replace my generators with async/await ? 
solution: 

issue: no@vpanjganjnode v6.+ will not run async/await out of the box, you can see how to use it here [<-LINK->] but you will need a transpiler. Promises and Generators are supported out of the box for node v6.* so you can just use that instead of depending on a 3rd party library unless you're not running on v6 for your project then stick with Bluebird it's not in Node's latest version yet [<-LINK->] Are you sure@oltmannsdanielit's not an issue with your code that's causing a block somewhere 
solution: I've always been used to using lodash for that@oltmannsdaniel:).

issue: with modules like gm, all they do is spawn the imagemagick binary anyway, so its not like its blocking the node process. 
solution: sharp doesn't use imagemagick though. yeah sharp looks nice, I had never seen it before. If you strictly need image resizing that looks like the way to go.. 

issue: still-dreaming-1: i'm talking about when you look at the implementation of the function. when it's usingthisyou can't know, just from the implementation, all the relevant info. still-dreaming-1: and a true abstraction means that you don'tneedany more info to know what's happening -foo.bar()does not meet that criteria, even if you read the implementation ofbar. iostreamer-X: bluebird is fasterin v8 onlybecause it doesn't exactly follow the spec, and takes advantage of that to optimize things. but native promises are fast enough.

Typical usage of gm is something like gm('/path/to/image.jpg').identify((err, data) => { ... }); and lets say I wanted to stub the identify method to make it return and error if I do sinon.stub(gm, 'identify').yields(new Error(...)) it doesn't work, says 'identify' is not a method on gm presumably it has to do with the fluent interface of gm 
solution: 

issue: in transform streams in node. is there an event emitter for when you've processed all the chunks already? kinda collecting all the chunks then work with that data to transform it Egoscio: hmm. like when you implement the _transform method you pass chunk encoding and callback then you use this.push(whatever you want you push out of the transformation method) Egoscio: is there a way to wait for all chunks to come first/compile all the chunks in an event emitter like end Egoscio: I will probably do it in the transform method if there is no event emitter that allows me to access the compiled chunks 
solution: I'd imagine maybe you could listen for push's and add it to a variable, then process it all at once after the finish event. To be honest, I never had to deal with streams much, only basing my knowledge off code I've read in frameworks.

solution: 

issue: you mean how JS can't ever possibly have coroutines? and let's please not sexualize programming. personally i don't find koa or co pleasant to work with, nor anything with generators. 
solution: 

issue: even if v8 ships it, node still will hold it back unless they've resolved the interop questions. i wouldn't hold your breath. 
solution: In my case, the serviceB.findItemB() is a function that takes the item in the array and a callback. 

issue: ljharb: Can I only use Promise for this part of the code and continue with callbacks when I am more comfortable and slowly making the change to Promises? 
solution: But with the async coming in the ES17 will it not be the next thing ? it will use promises ?. also ES2017. two digits refers to the edition number, and ES2017 is ES8.. 

issue: I think node.js were favoring a different extension for modules.. and then the bullets are finished.. 
solution: 

issue: ljharb: Well, i guess something like that is needed,  given when you have python like imports but not every file is a module..  let alone the same format (considering interoperability ) .. 
solution: right. there's different parse goals, so a different extension makes the most sense..

issue: Hi guys I want to do afs.readFileSyncfor a file. But I don’t wont it to throw an exception when the file doesn’t exist. Basically read the file, if file wasn’t there carry on 
solution: 

issue: Never use the exception mechanism when for one, it's expected that there will be bad data And also when you can just as easily replace it with an error code check. However, I'd recommend exceptions if the amount of error checking you're doing becomes cumbesome and begins to overwhelm the codebase Is this the sexiest deep copy of a POJO ever or what?let h = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(a)); I ripped that from the MDN Talk about amazing!

issue: is there a better way to check whether a variable is undefined other thantypeof a === ‘undefined’? hm. ok, thank you. sotypeof t === 'undefined' || t === nullis the check? 
solution: it’s better than having to check for each variable.. 

issue: typeof a !== "undefined" && a !== null undefined would not work for when you set it to null it would only work for when its really not defined  (in JS, null is considered defined) but not correct triple operators also check for type they dont do cast that usually is not very important but can be crucial

solution: jamen: if someone gives you an array from another realm (like an iframe)instanceof Arraywill return false.. jamen: that's whyArray.isArraywas added to the language in 2009. so people would use that instead and it would give the right answer.. 

issue: And what is ECMA doing about this? They just keep piling on new features, as if this is a solution. Adding all of these fancy new features to JavaScript amounts to putting lipstick on a pig.Don't the new features mitigate some or a lot of what is considered wrong with JS? And then, I think, maybe after a long time the bad stuff could be deprecated and removed in favor of the new functionality. Or is stuff not deprecated and removed ever?

issue: In view folder i have some file name with .pug what does that do? for passport abhisekp: i found it thanks 
solution: 

issue: if it was possible, you'd be able to violate JS semantics so i really really hope it's not the scope/context of a function should be private right - properties set on the function are public and accessible in JS as well i would assume that you can't do anything observably in C++ with a JS object that you can't do in JS, otherwise that violates the spec and that means that vars that are out of scope are impossible to access, thankfully vpanjhanj: there's a bash autocompletion file inside $NVM_DIR also there's a gitter channel for nvm too :-) 
solution: 

issue: atom isn't node; can you require stuff the same way there? i'm not sure you can

issue: Hi, I have a problem with global, I didglobal.x=3ina.jsbut when I do require('./a.js') in repl, I can not useglobal.x I understand global is bad practice, but I need a quick hack, anyone know why it does not work? thanks 
solution: 

issue: no -- here global is real global variables not something by usingmodule.exports 
solution: When yourequire()you cannot access variables within that file unless they're exported. Technically speaking if you\'re going to use it outside the scope of the file you\'re going to "export" it. 

issue: bweston92: not true. Globals are available in and outside modules. That's how you get access to prototypes and global functions bobzhang: by default global context is disabled when starting a repl server, withrepl.start() 
solution: 

issue: ok, style question: I have a function calleddefOrElsein a module calledcommon. Referencingcommon.defOrElsedozens of times is .. unwieldy. Is it “ok” to do aconst dOE = common.defOrElseat the top of each module that uses it to shorten? well, I’m exportingcommonin common.js defOrElseis a static function within there (does that make sense?) 
solution: 

issue: I do think the fact that it's so easy to download a potentially malicous package is a good reason to push the Node team to release a more comprehensive standard library which would guard against that kind of thing. It can happen in C++ as well via malicious macros but the standard library it has is actually rather robust so there's not nearly as strong a demand for external dependencies There's a lot of common algorithms though. 
solution: 

issue: that's not scalable in a world with the amount of users JS has 
solution: Cheers!. LeonineKing1199: I hate C++ stds. 

issue: i have it in my schema something like this   title: {type: String, required: '{PATH} is required.'}

solution: 

issue: ok, doesresolvethen wait for the promise? that is, I shouldn’t do that until I’m ready to block? right, I’ve wrapped fs.readFile as a promise. 
solution: 

issue: nothing async blocks. JS is single-threaded. and you can wrap anything in a promise, including fs.readFile. also generators are synchronous;cojust tries to fake coroutines by hiding async stuff behind a generator-receiving-function earl-brown: promises don\'t "end", they\'re a future value for work that has already begun

I have found a lot of theory at web but i haven't found a practical proposal to implemment pub-sub on each nodejs microservices.... RabbitMQ? Anyone has experience And wants to share your Stack?

solution: 

issue: Does anyone know of a module that automatically installs missing dependencies as you're developing? for example, like npm-install-webpack-plugin that does such a thing as part of the build step for webpack. I'm looking for an equivalent for server-side development. For example, let's say I'm running nodemon and it automatically refreshes the server process on js file saves. As I'm building, I require needed modules and then continue developing. Instead of receiving a 'cannot find module' error, I would like for the module to be installed and then the process to continue working.

issue: array vs string? string is probably faster, but its a very small difference unless the data size is ridiculously large

issue: Hi all! Why event 'end' not emitted when i emit 'error'. I create custom name 'myError' for complete emit 'end'. Why 'end' not emited with 'error'? 
solution: I use 'fs.createReadStream'. without this.emit('error'..) 'end' method called ok. 

issue: littlefuntik: Try calling end inside write. littlefuntik: Sorry that was a lousy reply. Try extending the class with Stream instead of  EventEmitter Okay so a little bit of google and I found that emitting error ends the stream. So the end() won't be called implicitly. So call this.end() before you emit('error')

issue: Hey guys. Is there any way to start simple js server directly from html file script tag section, so that there would be no console interaction at all? 
solution: swelham: I have a simple angular app, and for it to load files correctly in needs a server behind. I've got request to deliver current app, so that one could just open at least index.html file in browser, so that it would work without any consoles and scripts on the one behalf. As far as I know it will not work withfile://protocol.. Also what is the issue in starting the node server manually?The client who requested files, knows nothing about programming. He wants to open index.html and be done with it.Sorry I'm not sure I follow. Are you trying to open a node process on your server when a client first downloads your index.html file? [<-CODE->].

issue: I've looked at adm-zip at least my conclusion was that it has some issues. but fire away with your question 
solution: 

issue: kevinludwig: I'm getting a whole load of zip files that I need to loop through and collect their meta-data and shove it into MongoDB. I think my problem is that I'm thinking synchronously and the code is running in an async fashion. I'll grab some code and post it. kevinludwig: Also, after I collect the meta-data then I want to unzip them to a specific location. Obviously this kind of processing is going to take some time and I think the code gets ahead of itself and I'm not handling callbacks properly. I'm pretty new to this stuff so don't be too surprised by my lack of coding skills.  [<-CODE->] the call to Uploads.find() retrieves my dataset from MongoDB 
solution: 

issue: when you say that there's no callback do you mean that the package doesn't provide the ability to add a callback? or use a callback? 
solution: 

issue: have you tried putting console.log into the map or filter steps? It might point you in the right direction. 
solution: if it prints nothing I would assume that's because one of your filter functions is removing everything..

issue: getting ENOENT errors for this:require('child_process').spawn('git status').But not for:require('child_process').exec('git').

issue: anybody knows why RAM is not freed after node.js script execution? at least not completely 
solution: 

issue: kunokdev: Is this after the app has closed or runtime after initializing? jeserkin: I was a little curious myself as to why you might be getting 16% usage at a constant rate, from what I've seen so far it's due to a callback being unable to execute for one reason or the other. It might be that a value is expected to be returned that never is so it gets stuck in the loop.Just had a look at my own process whilst running an app and it seems to stay quite minimal when idle...

solution: 

issue: maxage_twitter: you can have multiple versions in your tree, but not at the same level. you def don't want that. vpanjganj: the solution is, never useexportsyntax in your package's entry points. no user should ever have to cope with.default ie, domodule.exports = whateverin the entry points. you can't remove it, no. you could dothis.onRedraw = undefinedin the constructor tho 
solution: that\'s what "inherit" means - you need 100% of the functionality, with potentially some tweaked behavior.

solution: 

issue: SameerSiddiqui: its not hard to do that by hand really like, implement a registry, which basically consists of an array of function pairs (the accept function and the handler function). And you just loop until you find a suitable handler. 
solution: kevinludwig: And you just loop until you find a suitable handler.how this possible with outifblock. blackode: i assumed he meant how to do it without a massive chain of if/else.

issue: martinheidegger: Kindly thanks for reply ;) I knew about singular packages, already ;)I need to deploy older project and I can't change the code in any way... I need to discover, whylodash/function/debounceis not working anymore... :( Is it due to changes in lodash package (because they offer singular packages for now)? Or maybe I'm using some older node version which is unable to handlelodash/function/debouncenotation? 
solution: 

issue: istanbul seems geared toward terminal usage or emulating terminal usage from the API. Is there some code you can just run inside the code you want to get coverage on? Well I mean some code you would run from a test before requiring the code being tested and covered? Blanket seemed more fitting for that but it is not working for me, which is not surprising as it is not longer maintained 
solution: running it that way lets it instrument your code without being invasive.. 

issue: Sure. call a thing a thing. Have  a routing table that takes the req url strips the previous '/' and call the method directly. Learned that meta programming trick in the ruby community. Actually speaking on how most cases if statements can be removed. Actually won $100 from a naysayer. 
solution: have a handler object @bweston92 .routes = {  healthz () { },  merge () {    if(req.method != 'POST') return; // This quarantines the predicate to where it's supposed to be.  }}routes[req.url.slice(1)]  <<< This removes 2 if statements alone.I get it that you didn't know how to do it. But doesn't mean it's not possible. ;-). 

issue: Yeah, again I want to get to the problem, not having to create a middleware stack. Which is why I just wanted a "simple package" something that doesn\'t mean maintaince for different uncovered scenarios. Clearly you can\'t ask simple questions and get simple answers, all I was asking for was a recommendation as I am not fully comfortable knowing which node packages are out there at the minutes. 
solution: Dude again "middleware" can be like 3 lines of code. You literally could have written what you needed in this time.  I think we\'re bike shedding. LOL. That said. I am willing to pair with you on it later if you like.  No worries. I\'ll show you how to get like 80% (or some random percentage) of your if statements out of the code. Otherwiserequire(\'http\') and call it a day. Your choice. Let me know. :-). 

issue: Guys i need good idea. I know node.js not working this way but i try to develop something like lamp stack server on koa framework and try to supporting virtual hosting. Basic idea is run server then auto require vhosts js files.  Problem is server must not restart self while change vhost files but changes must be live on server like it makes php. I know it can't working like php because it needs to require and cache everything before starting work and i can only clear cache for make this job. But i want to avoid watching all vhosts directories for signaling about clear cache because it's very expensive to watch everything. Need good idea how to make this with minimal affects to performance.

solution: 

issue: Hey@crosofg, seems you don't have a catch statement. Maybe in heroku you have some strict rule that don't allow Unhandled rejections, that's not putting a catch on a promise. 
solution: linxet: I will try and see now. 

issue: crosofg: now it\'s catching the error? If yes, try with typing "throw e;" instead of "console.log(e);", this will hopefully give us the stack trace Seems that Jimp.read(imgUrla) it's not a promise for some reason, but without the stack trace is hard to tell

issue: How would someone go about proposing an idea for a future ECMA version? How specific should the idea be for it to not be frowned upon on the basis of just being a wish or not technical enough? 
solution: Yeah. Actually we talked about it a little. I am wondering if it might be a good idea for code coverage support to be a specification of the language itself. This would force (if they choose to follow the standard) engines / runtimes to provide code coverage features. In my opinion the runtime / engine is the only piece of technology in the ideal position to provide this information.. Ideally there should be some classes or functions that could be called to stop and start code coverage for a specific collector. Then reports could be generated from that collector. It would be nice if this was just regular javascript code that could be run from any script for it to start tracking coverage code that comes after it..

issue: bweston92: @BenSower [<-ISSUE->] i'm unable to reproduce it any more. 
solution: 

issue: crosofg: did you figure out your promises? #bluebird channel might be more oriented to that. You have a lot of nesting and missing some returns, it looks like. 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] did I get it right? I have a problem with anything that reduces reliability. and “first or nothing” reduces reliability. if your redundant server infrastructure is so fragile that you can’t tolerate a SYN to each server from each prospective client (and can’t tolerate holding a connection for the TCP timeout) then you’re doing it wrong. anyway back to scala :) 
solution: 

issue: why does it have to be parallel and not serial until no more to try then return fail; reject promise etc on fail - try next 
solution: it also lets you return as soon as the first one responds instead of having to cycle through multiple options waiting for a timeout. 

issue: 'require()' automatically caches every module you load behind the scenes@Hesulan Thanks so much for the explanation.  I'm still a little fuzzy and maybe it's my question/situation, but here is my scenario: [<-CODE->] Will this work properly?  Is logger.info now callable in the module.js scope? I should say, I've tried it and it doesn't work... is it possible?  I was successful by passingloggeras one of the parameters, but not sure that is ideal/best practice.

I have to update the tower ?  [<-CODE->] If i delete Superman or Update it or if i add a new Hero, the request is a PUT of my Tower ? You said to me to let heroes on towers. So just one Schema .```The consequence of this is that i just access to api/towers. and i can't delete a hero /api/heroes DELETE i just can UPDATE the tower with PUT 
solution: If you mean my earlier example of putting everything in self-contained documents, heroes would simply be members of a tower, just like the tower'stitleand other properties; they wouldn't exist separately.

solution: Can I automate this task ??. and you can have init scripts to start processes. 

issue: AkashGutha: like he said you can simply choose what runs at startup, but just for reference you could also put \'"start":"service mongodb start; node server.js"\' in the "scripts" section of your package.json. (adjust those commands according to your init system and startup script) I highly recommend the startup method for your case, that's just for reference

issue: @PraveenGottala1the only way I could think of doing this, and I do not say that this is a good way, is to make a shell script which inserts this into the package.json and runs npm install.But I would really not recommend this.why not initially install the package and just require it when needed? so you want some kind of " deploy a component -> add it and package.json -> npm install it " mechanism? The package.json is just a dependency file which will just install the package independently of running a nodejs thread.I believe when a node app has been started - a new package is installed and you require it, it should work.haven't tested it so not 100% sure on this So you don't want to update the package json if a new module has been deployed, but when your programm looks for it?

issue: bergben: I would assume where you are deploying would have node installed - for example on Heroku you provide build instructions and your package.json file and it does the rest.  I believe digital ocean works the same way.  I have not done it in a while so I am recalling this from memory 
solution: bergben: you need node at build time, and you should be deploying an archived tarball to production. 

issue: maxwellsmart84: you mean about the ellipses? Oh they're just there as an example placeholder. E.g.myFunc () { return true }.bind(this)gives the error on the dot between the curly brace andbind. 
solution: 

issue: bergben: you're definitely supposed to build, tar up the build, and then deploy that archive later bergben: which means you only need node to make the build. you don't need it in production at all, unless you're using a node service the only kind of errors that shouldn't crash your app are things you can't avoid - ie, if you needJSON.parse, that's gonna throw if it's invalid, so it's OK to catch that and recover

Not the app file which required the module.

issue: I'm starting out here and I only have experience in PHP and MySQL when it comes to back-end - only dealing with databases, and some basic form validations in JavaScript.I am wondering what would be the best choice for me and so far these two languages seem interesting to me. Node.js (I know it's JavaScript) and Python.What interests me about Node.js is that it's a part of the MEAN full stack, and I guess it's the modern kind of route. It uses the same syntax as JavaScript, and I will end up using JavaScript for front-end anyway, so that's something I should consider.When it comes to Python, I like it that it's a good language for beginners (which I am) and its syntax is pure and makes sense. I am actually going through a free course on CodeAcademy and it looks interesting and easy to remember.TL;DR: Would it be smarter to learn Node.js since I will end up using JavaScript for front-end, anyway, or should I instead learn Python? joshorvis: My focus would be web development, if that would help me make a choice. :/

issue: scippio: catch will catch errors in your code inside then() but if response has error  the caller that you are returning the promise to gets the rejected promise. you do not need the outer try catch unless you want to catch error from this.getA() I think I just confused the question even more, there is no http request so disregard that part of my response. ;-) 
solution: 

issue: scippio: is this.getA() your code or third party? If you want your exceptions to bubble up then that works,  Most of the Node code I see uses pure functions ( [<-LINK->] ) so if it's an elegant solution you seek try The Node Way ( [<-LINK->] ). 
solution: scippio: just noticed in your code snippet, if there is an error you return the error if not your returning the promise.  The method wrapping all that code should always return what ever you intended in your design like a promise. If you have an error you should throw it if you want it to bubble up to the caller. If you want to return the promise to the caller then I would catch any errors and then reject the promise so the caller gets the error via the failed callback..

issue: I am new to nodejs . I am currently having a project which is quite big and uses private packages too. will deleting any package from node_modules and pasting it again cause any harm to my project? Also when deplyoing to server, i did some mistake and the structure is different as that of my local. Example in my local i have packages installed on the same level of the project and also inside but on the server , packages are only installed inside the project.

issue: Hi all, JS newb - I'm in a bootcamp right now and I'm working on a problem where I need to make sense of async returns. Simple problem I'm sure but it's beating me up: A function simulates a warehouse - the warehouse has a paintbrush and paint. We're invoking the function for the brush and the paint at the same time with two separate function calls, the function has a var deliveryTime that is Math.random. We want to wait until the paint has been delivered before making the call for the brush - (can't paint without a brush). I'm looking at Promise but am having a hard time understanding it. Any help/direction appreciated! 
solution: 

issue: garretholland: do paintbrush and paint have callbacks? how are you calling them? If they use callback, you can call paint in the callback from paintbrush. If they return promises, you can certainly chain them and they will be called one after another. The emitter way mentioned above is also another approach.

issue: I have a node http request that grabs data and then pipes it through a jsonParser and then pipes that to a stream in objectmode with highwatermark set to 1. the stream converts the json objects to csv and writes it out to a file.  Somehow I\'m getting data loss - on the response from request I have a .on("data") listener that writes out the data straight to a raw.txt file and each time the file size of this raw.txt file is a little different. However if I remove the pipe after the jsonparser (the pipe to the objectmode stream) I don\'t have any data loss. Any ideas on why this would be? I\'m not seeing any errors thrown. I\'m thinking that maybe the buffer is overflowing

issue: Callbacks are ok... implemening OAuth with Angular as front-end is confusing playingwithinfinity: Me too, I had a big issue with callback. 
solution: 

issue: Does it make sense to have the backend nodejs api separated from the frontend? I kind of want to build a SPA frontend that only consumes a backend.. so i can change both the front and the backend independently.. Or would you say just embrace JS and build both together? 
solution: you can use JS and still seperate them. I am doing that right now, working on an SPA frontend using Angular and building an express API back end concurrently. 

issue: Not only is it possible, I'd recommend it!  Having a separate front end and backend forces you to consider separation of concerns and almost always results in a better end result. My best projects have been that way.  The intranet for my company is a nodejs MongoDB restful API backend, and a static knockoutjs requirejs frontend.  It works AMAZING 
solution: 

issue: Note also that MongoDB IS acid compliant at the document level.  If you design your schema properly that can meet many needs, but not all of them 
solution: greta-burp-bonus: i have only a little experience with front end stuff like html, css stuff. Nothing much with js or backend. 

issue: 2011 huh? some of those db's have been around a long time huh? ljharb: So can't like node fork a isolate into a new isolate that basically has no communication/sharing?  like aren't isolates heaps? 
solution: I expect that one isloate and another really don't have a way to communicate with each other if you ran two in parallel?  (assuming, from a addon perspective that isolate represents a javascript heap of objects/closures/etc. 

issue: well if it works in one place as an api, it should be easy enough to polyfill outside of the browser.sure... that doesn't mean anyone else will actually implement it? look at import for instance? 
solution: 

issue: sheetalgiri: I think you just redirect the user to the vendor website with all necessary params and the customer completes the transaction and result of that is sent to your callback server. So in this way you dont have to deal with user sensitive data. You just store details of transaction and relevant transaction id So whats the actual question? ah so you want the proxy server to be callback server? 
solution: In that case you can use ngrok to generate id and use that as your callback server, i.e run your local server and run ngrok with the same port as node as param and you will get temp address to use for callback server. In this way you can directly work on local setup. i have a test server to work with so i dont really need ngrock but it was nice to learn about it. 

issue: Whats the name part in the vue js file for? export default {name: 'someName', so what does it do? I thought it was related to the component somehow but mine work without it Im in the wrong channel Lmao 
solution: 

issue: but you make a prototype before starting hiring people and buying servers, licenses or configuring AWS to scale to a billion simultaneous connections It's an online emulator? It needs flash , that is usually a big drawback 
solution: Also you might face a lawsuit depending on where you and your server are. But regarding feedbacks I would say it needs the keybindings info before the gaming start. 

issue: Anyone alive? Hey@Hasnain-Haider Any ideas why findById(id,function(err, docs){}); doesn't work?

I create a table; load data into that table and then update data in the table i 3 separate node.js functions however, i get an error "Cannot read property \'SeasonID\' of undefined" which looks to be happening because the INSERT and UPDATE executions are running before sqlite has finished creating the table does anybody have any suggestions? its so frustrating@WiseKodamathere is a serialize() method that forces the execution to wait until the previous one has finished; but it doesn't seem to work for me.

solution: 

issue: It\'s actually not correct that MongoDB is not ACID-compliant. On the contrary, MongoDB is ACID-compilant at the document level.Any update to a single document isAtomic: it either fully completes or it does notConsistent: no reader will see a "partially applied" updateIsolated: again, no reader will see a "dirty" readDurable: (with the appropriate write concern)What MongoDB doesn\'t have is transactions -- that is, multiple-document updates that can be rolled back and are ACID-compliant. Im building a practice app anyway.. I dont think il be taking massive orders on it just something for the cv 
solution: you have a shopping cart table with a user_id and a product_id table. and your user table has a "funds" column .. now when a user purchases something.. you might want to.

Finally solved a problem with my frontend now I only have the node issue I need to create a radio api, and I have two ways to go in mind:1- Web Audio API on node (I don't know if it's mature enough or if it's already fully available to simply play a mp3 audio into an audio node from an audioContext.2- FFMPG with node fluent ffmpeg. Also I don't know how do I retrieve the current stream after it's created, not sure if it's the best way to go. But okay. 3 - ?

solution: michaelKurowski: for that matter then, the entire package is built around using gulp for express.  You might want to give it a test run to see it in action, if your wanting to learn a task manager, then build off of that to make any package you want.  That is what i designed it for.     If you use the documentation on the main page, or the webfront page, thats better.  the wiki is falling behind and needs updating  a bit.. 

issue: Nope, I’m afraid you won’t. Writing a unit-test is simple@michaelKurowski. Developing good opinions on testing will take a while . But you can do a lot in a day to at least make sure you come across right in an interview and won’t be dismissed for them not seeing the true you or a silly slip up.

issue: well... maybe an event model ; something.on( "event" ) adds an event so if something new wants to do something with a certain emit( "event", msg ); then it can? but kinda; depends on your processing requirements; and how to divide the work ends up ... like if you do a cluster that's receiving on a master and delivering tot he child; of course the child eventutally posts a result of that processed module... 'connection' doens't seem to exist where you think it does indyk1: doesn't make sense that connection would go away ; since you already used connection.connect()... but maybe it's a deeper issue that you have to wait for it to be connected?  DOes .connect take a callback or something?  [<-LINK->] ? 
solution: indyk1:  [<-LINK->] which looks like a direct copy of this first example ... so it's not the connect();.

solution: 

issue: bilaal-s: request.on(‘end’, function () {})is what you want to do once the request to your server is done asking, or ‘requesting’ what it wants. It’s then up to the server to actually respond to the request. For this you use theresponseobject. But you have to act, you have torespond.end()which tells Node to complete the response. In turn, you could imagine on the client that made the request an event is fired. So (on a completely different computer) someone might doresponse.on(‘end’, function () {})and specify what they want to do once they get the response back from the server. if you want a good introduction to the basics of node, like how to use it as a server, check out [<-LINK->] (so yes, include a call to the.endfunction in the.on(‘end’, function(){})

issue: To provide some more detail@mkelley33, the duplicate email error and the request error won’t go back together. I mean you could force it that way by givingjoia custom validation function that actually checks if the email is already stored but it would slow your request down a fair bit. More importantly it doesn’t make much sense. If the request is valid besides the email you would’ve found out the email isn’t unique when you ask your db to add it. If the request is invalid you could respond at this point with what’s wrong with it. The error code will be the exact same. prokawsar: ‘take an array and for each element in the array execute the given function.' Is there anything specifically you don’t understand about that sentence?

issue: purefan: I've been wondering what Redis really adds? In my noob head this is a very simple operation (read/write from/to memory) so why would one add a layer like Redis? Also, how does it help scalability, as opposed to just using a simple module to read & write on my server's memory? 
solution: alexerhardt: yes, redis is an in-memory storage, so you have one server with atomic operations for read/write/update. If you only have one server then node-cache is fine, but if you have 2 servers or more then having a caching server solves a lot of problems.

I've built an simple server-side only express API connected to MongoDB for an app. I'm creating the front end differently and using http GET to request information and so on to the server. Where can I host this express server for free for testing?? does heroku take server only files? im not planning to output anything visual on my server just data requests and responses thanks@alexerhardt and@Hardware-Hacks 
solution: 

issue: Hardware-Hacks: that spy doesn’t work because Node caches the modules you require. In other words when you requireapp.jsNode freezes what function.preProcessingis going to call.app.main = spydoesn’t actually overwrite anything in this cached module. When you change the call tomodule.exports.main(mails);Node can no longer cache what function to call and looks it up every time you callpreProcess. I think there’s strong reasons not to do things like this but I’m not sure about the why’s.

issue: Ha, for once Node's actually good at this kind of thing. Just use a global counter :P The only issues with this are if you start using multiple-processes But if you're using just one Node process, a global counter works fine Though I must admit, this approach has a code smell to it for the reasons listed above 
solution: It needs to exist and live outside of your route handlers. But because JS is single-threaded, you can safely increment a global counter.

solution: Right, so if you want to understand why you need HTTPS you should really just read up on it. The short of it is that you can’t eavesdrop. It lets users request what they want to request without others being able to see what they’re actually getting. This requires a browser be able to make sure it’s really talking to the server it wants to talk to, that’s where those certs come in..

issue: dragon-spear: I'm not sure what you mean by pipeline in mongodb data type, can you try wording it a different way? dragon-spear: it's an array that defines for an aggregation pipeline for a view.  Not something you need for normal collections at all dragon-spear: see here [<-LINK->] 
solution: dragon-spear: in fact, I'm a certified mongodb developer and I don't think I've ever used createCollection.  You can insert a document into a collection that doesn't exist and it will be created on the fly using defaults.  The only time you would use it is if you need a capped collection or wanted something that didn't just use the defaults.  I'm sure there are other uses, I certainly haven't used every feature :).

issue: FieryCod: depends on the body encoding you’re expecting. If you’re not going to receive urlencoded data there’s no point. You need to add body parsers for the body types you’re expecting. FieryCod: it’s a type of payload. when you send data to a server you have to tell it how to interpret the data, that’s what the Content-Type header is for. Also called a MIME or media type.x-www-form-urlencodedor urlencoded for short, is one such type. If express is to translate it into a data structure JS can work with it has to parse it. The urlencoded body parser is capable of this.

issue: Let me try and make my point obvious. If you’re learning, go have fun and learn things, just know it’s not the most useful thing to learn. Why? Because you probably don’t need rate limiting. If you do, know that it’s a very hard thing to do, and you’re probably best off just using a simple rate limiter. Most reverse proxies / load balancers will have them built in. If you want to know why I feel that way or get a deeper understanding of load limiting in general here’s an excellent article: [<-LINK->] jasionLaw: you probably want code 429  [<-LINK->] What purefan said ‘ll work. Add a simple store like redis, store a latest timestamp every time you see an ip, then before answering look up if you have a timestamp for the ip, and if it’s less than the limit reject the request. Again, not the proper way to do rate limiting, but a fine way to learn.

solution: 

issue: devjam1: then you want a check on the client side. The client side can store a flag in localStorage/cookies/etc the idea is that clicking on the icon would reset this flag before reloading.  As for the backend, the reload icon in your app can do a "special reload" where it actually sets a GET param andforwardsthe user to that page which can be same page they\'re on, that way the backend gets that this is an icon triggered reload WORMSS: :) glad I was helpful devjam1: also, you should revoke your credentials and possibly edit your post

issue: still; reading the docs is still not entirely sufficient, often they require trying to implement along with reading the docs to see  if it's a good fit.  Some things like issuing execute stored procedures for sql server were not obvious from the docs; I mean aren't they just SQL statements?  Turns out they're not, and require the driver to build a proper request to the server.  I wouldn't have known from just the docs. 
solution: 

issue: why not just websockets?And why not give the user a unique token (UUID) that references a timestamp stored in the server instead of keeping the timestamp on the client? and they can't share a database? 
solution: shrugmaybe if you just encode it in a goofy way?  base64 encoded and/or crypted with some hash?  still changeable but more difficult than just going 'oh type a new date value here'.

solution: Yaitan: No I'm interacting with a blockchain smart contract. lms is a smart contract constructor and I'm calling a function called addBook and it returns a transaction receipt in JSON but it takes at-least 4-5 secs to execute and that's why I've used then to wait until lms.addBook is executed.

issue: hello ... getting started with node.js, and i'm trying to prove that I can run the same ultra-simple server on my website (godaddy shared hosting) that I can from the terminal on my mac, via localhost. If a run the single line: [<-CODE->] then i can see the response from by browser at localhost:3000.i have shell access for my site, and i can do exactly the same thing from the domain ... but i can't figure out how to see it. I think I'm missing a crucial insight here! Is what I'm trying to do even possible? so port 80 is what the existing web server is running on, and the others are closed by default, and i can't open them because it's shared hosting ... !it actually has node pre-installed. but i doesn't seem to do much good. Thanks for you answers! 
solution: 

issue: geofholbrook: You'll need apache or nginx and proxy requests on port 80 to this server on localhost:3000. I'm assuming your shared webhosting doesn't have port 3000 open by default. geofholbrook: I thought GoDaddy shared hosting doesn't allow installing software? 
solution: geofholbrook: if they don't support node on the shared plan, you might want to look into the 12 month free tier for aws. 

issue: Jamesoncy: you have passed it a reference to a function, but it has lost context of the instance it had come from. either use_.get("/", person.helloWorld.bind(person));or_.get("/", (...args) => person.helloWorld(...args)); Jamesoncy: in future updates to Javascript (and I do mean Javascript, not just node) you will be able to do_.get("/", person::helloWorld);which will just be syntax sugar for the first example above. Jamesoncy: if router does argument counting, you may need to do_.get("/", (ctx, resp) => person.helloWorld(ctx, resp));if you wanted to not use.bindfor some reason.

issue: ohdelloh: To catch them is my real test, To train them is my cause d3x0r: dont bother..@arc512likes to ask a question, and then not listen to anyone answering him, or trying to help him. He just vanishes, and then asks again some time later.. Its easier to just ignore him. @arc512 You said you needed help, and then never said anything.. You actually need to type on the keyboard to communicate your need. You can't just think it and then expect people on the other end of the computer to know what you need help with..all you said was you needed help with deconstructing. ok [<-CODE->] There you go, done.. 
solution: 

issue: bastienmichaux: Ah, my mind went to knockout observables, i forgot that generators are referred to as observables too :)  I've yet to see a good use for generators besides making promises.  It's been an evolution of sorts.  But I think you are making things more complicated than they need to be since you just aren't that familiar with promises yet.  Give it some time and get comfortable and I think you'll find the error handling really isn't as complex as it seems at face value. bikeshedder: This is 100% true in C# as well.  I found myself in some UBER brain ticklers using async/await :) 
solution: It's that once you start using async/await you are doing async programming in a multi threaded way.  So you actually run into a lot of the same issues you would when using threads.  NOTHING is ever in scope unless you capture it, and I'm not sure how that plays out in javascript yet, but in C# it caused many a hard to track down bugs :).

issue: hi guys, i\'m fairly new to node and am trying to use async.retry. The problem I\'m encountering is that the async function I pass to retry refers to "this" and being called from async.retry appears to change its value. Any idea on how to remedy? I tried \'use strict\', but to no avail. 
solution: then use self as the this value inside the function. 

issue: Thanks@karimsqualli, thanks, that has gotten me a step further at least (although now the callback is not firing) 
solution: 

issue: the require syntax vs import node doesnt support import syntax yet has to do with the async nature of import syntax transpiling just for imports is a bit overkill considering most ES6 is already supported by node IMHO 
solution: Lucky then if you use TypeScript which makes transpiling mandatory anyway. xD.

issue: @aaronbeall  disconnect is probably just end stream .. or generate an EOF which is ctrl-z (windows) or ctrl-D (linux).  Which usually if a process is reading stdin for input it will end up with the program exiting.the best way is probably send it some command to \'quit\' otherwise all you can do is disconnect(), wait a while for it to end and then kill("SIGTERM") it..kill( "SIGINT" ) is ctrl-C.

issue: hi all,pls help,I want to use async / awaitnode version v8.1.2npm version 5.0.3 [<-CODE->] 
solution: You don't declare it as a variable, it is already being defined as a function. 

issue: joshuamanns: Yeah, they get the whole bundle usually. Just make sure your API is locked down and if someone does try something they don’t have access too, you block them at the server and don’t deliver the data. Same as multiplayer gaming: never assume the client is sending you legit info :) joshuamanns: i.e. If someone tries to go to /admin even though you’ve hidden the menu item, and they don't have admin access, just don’t have your API deliver the admin data to hydrate the page.

issue: Morning all, Just upgraded to NPM 5 yesterday and ran into some npm install behavior I can't explain. Dependencies that I've included in my package file are not having their own dependences installed. When my build runs, I get errors about modules not being found. So, I suppose I would phrase it as... Sub-deps are not being installed when I run npm install on NPM version 5. Any help understanding the way NPM 5 installs and why sub-deps wouldn't be added would be much appreciated! I did nuke all my node_modules folders out of this project, it's a rather large project though.... so I will try again Thank you David!

issue: Gurpreet3131: if the remote server is your personal shitbox and you have not set the dns, then you would have to use the same ip you used for ssh the machine. And if you run node, specify what port you want to run your server, like port 3000 etc... Then the address for the remote would be 999.999.999:3000 being 9's your remote ip

issue:  [<-CODE->] When you say the static "private" doesn\'t work, what do you mean? Do you get an error message? A 404? A 500? Do you get "public" instead? Does a black hole appear? Does node fail immediately b/c of a syntax error?

Although it\'s returning a function call that returns a singleton of that instance, something still felt dirty about that.

issue: What do you guys think would be the best way to (from scratch) have an easy to use blogging interface for users? They would enter info into a form and click a button to add to the blog. Is appending a container with all the content the best way to do it? What would be a better way to do it with Node JS (I'm not super familiar with Node JS). 
solution: I'd say you start with something like a single dynamo table—for your blog posts—and store them as one giant json object, with all the stuff you need in it, and then your frontend app is just rendering your json into whatever html you want..

issue: I prefer having a user role attribute in my user database but purely up to the individual but separating them out feels awfully table based design in my opinion where its nice with documents to just lump in an attribute thats easily checkable against 
solution: 

issue: That's the best way of doing it. Why would you want your front-end and back-end all sitting under one folder? That would be an absolute mess. 
solution: theromie: Well that comes with building an authentication system that manages user access to areas of the code. Passport will manage session auth, but your Vue.js frontend will have to deal with the access to areas in the front-end. Alternatively, build your express back-end to deny access to certain data based on the role you've given a user.. This is a lot more complicated then I think you realise on the surface. I'd maybe recommend a framework with an auth model if you aren't prepared to learn about handling auth in an application..

issue: Hey guys! Sorry  if this question is too basic. But what is buffer? Are they a portion of memory for storing data? And how do they relate with streams? Is this the kind of thing when you say 'I'm streaming a video on YouTube and it's buffering'?

issue: any1 knows hpw to solve my problem? 
solution: 

issue: RationalCoding: depends on what you're doing.  I have written many files and they don't change.  Non binary mode on windows will replace \\n with \\r\\n which can make it slightly bigger but not a lot (it will break images though) you can edit that and put ``` before and after the code parts to format it better and a newline (cttrl-enter) and I said edit, not repost if you start with up-arrow it recalls your last message so you can edit or when you mouse over it on the top right is three dots ... that you can click on and select edit you need a newline```code```Or inline  (if it was just a single line ``` code stuff ``` close :)  just need those on a separate line clap I'd think it can't sequalize code ( the function) which contains your other stuff)but I don't really know

issue: on one side i have a collection that stores the route of files uploaded and on the other i have the dir that container these files uploaded. So what i want is to set like a timer on each document that expires at after a certain time and once they expire Id like to the dir to be deleted and so the document azarus: I see , but the ttl thing@martskinsmight be an aproachable solution only if I could make that once the docs expire I could trigger a function to delete the directories 
solution: 

issue: mm does 'delete' fire when the database deletes it though? 
solution: I mean, i havent used yet. I don't think it does. but if that doesn't work, the redis way is a nice way to solve that. 

issue: yeah, I guess you can run some cron on server start though, to synchronize redis and the dir I have been using it without issues, but I am aware of the "not reliable" thing .. it really depends on the use case though, but yeah.. my bad for not bringing that up

issue: Hello, I am new to nodejs. I have this simple script I wrote to start a server on another port if the given port is busy It works but there's something I don't quite understand in the way in which it works. Here's the code: [<-CODE->] please, can anyone explain to me why it printsserver is listening on port 3000 again before printing server is listening on 3001? blakecodes: oh!@blakecodesI thought it was going to exit from that block of code, and wouldn't reach the console.log part since the server starting resulted in an error 
solution: 

issue: Because regardless of the error state your doing:console.log(server is listening on ${port}) see how that statement isn’t in the if (err)? So regardless of whether you’re getting an error or not, you’re still logging it so it will say listening on 3000 even when it’s not true. ayondot: see what I mean? Theoritically it should, but for some reason you aren’t triggering an error with that method so it isn’t stopping@ayondot

I read it line by line, and need to make all my setintervals (node-scheduler is only a sophisticated setInterval with cron format support) on the fly from the textfile..So I create those cronjobs in a for loop. And I think there is the problem, as I found out by googling. But dont know how to do it otherwise. I simplified it again, I think its a simple generic problem.. [<-CODE->] adambuczek: - thats all. scheduleJob takes the cron string and you can tell the function it should execute

solution: dig into the docs. thats the best advice. converting things like that just take time. there’s no way around it. WORMSS: that would be a better thing too! Ideally,@skyboy1997all your calls to the db should be in its own class/module. from there you should have an interface that other classes call to and transfer their info to that class to be put in the database. with an interface, it doesn’t matter how you implement it in the background (PSQL, mongo, flatfile, etc) because the interface doesn’t change, only the implementation.

issue: Because you're returning the user before it's set by the query, that query is asynchronous, so it initaties the query and immediately goes to the next item. 
solution: 

issue: what do you need data for@miki996since if it's successful then it won't throw an error do you need the 'user' variable in your application? he doesn't need the user = await there since it's a connection.query seems to be a callback based function 
solution: 

issue: I am not that familiar with async yet, but does't he need to return something from his callback function so that the await can return it too? He's passing a callback toquery()and also using await... 
solution: so async functions return a promise. he needs await to resolve that promise. which seems to be fine. 

issue: wont work, its a callback based function, you should wrap it in a new Promise((resolve, reject) => {}) 
solution: You use some kind of promisifyer or use a new Promise. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] i am getting this in the console from the code@kanalasumant 
solution: 

issue: Wouldn't That would generate a stack overflow ifnis too big? I've seen this happens and that's when I found that one should usethen( loop)without parameters Try it with a very large number... 
solution: used it loads of times, before async etc. each new loop depends on the previous completing.

solution: 

issue: that does not sound like a nodejs question.... Can you explain how that relate to node? d3x0r: Start reading and experimenting with express, this will give you a starting point.

issue: Hi guys! Can anyone help me? I'm creating a weather app using node and express. I want the app to say the temp and also the description of the weather. when i try to access the description I get an error TypeError: Cannot read property 'description' of undefined. I've been trying to figure this out since last night. Here's my code:  [<-LINK->] And here is my parsed json...  [<-LINK->] I'm just trying to get the description in the first weather array Ok, I see. Let me give it a try YES!! Thank you so much! Gee, I was breaking my head over that, haha 
solution: 

issue: The errorCannot read property 'description' of undefined.means that if you have something likeweather.description, then theweathervariable is undefined. Can you add some code to verify that its not undefined before trying to use it? Also, maybe I misread but from what you pasted,JSON.parse(body)would not return theweatherobject but the whole thing, so you would need to doweather.weather[0].descriptionto be able to see the description of the first weather item in the array.

In my case I have a huge csv file I’m reading in with the byline library, and after 100 lines I want to stop streaming in the file so as not to take up memory. (streaming this large of a file and buffering it into memory takes up too much memory and can crash the app) I attempted to do it in the following manner: [<-CODE->] However, when doing it this way I get the following error: [<-CODE->] While it doesn’t break my app, I’d obviously much rather do this cleanly. So obviously after calling destroy and having that finish, the stream still tries to push chunks?

issue: jasvir99: If you do an onchange event, you can call the node side at that point that will either do the calculation or return you the data from the session so you can calculate on the client side. AFAIK, you cannot share session data between client/server as usually the session data is stored on a backend database and referenced with a session id which is in the cookie. You could save the data in a cookie, and then the data would be available from both client/server if they share the same conditions (domain, ssl)

issue: what are my best choices to write/re-use a simple node http/s server that acts as client routing requests to an existing HTTP-proxy? hi@JohnnyBizzelthanks for your response. I already saw that one, but I think that is not exactly what I am looking into (maybe I am wrong) . The thing is that I have to act as a client to an HTTP-Proxy. I will double check still 
solution: joaocfernandes: I will be honest "The thing is that I have to act as a client to an HTTP-Proxy." I don\'t really know what that means.. 

issue: joaocfernandes: So you recieve a request on your server, and based ont hat information, need to hit another server with a request fro your server? Request rewrite doesn't sound like what you want, because then you'd just bea proxy and it sounds like you need some custom information from another place that the client doesn't have access to but your server can deligate and decide for instead.

issue: Seolhun: I do not know how the JS engine works in browsers. But I do know that the node.js engine is able to support multiple events concurrently by using the event loop. There's an excelent video showing how this works. Let me get the link.  [<-LINK->] 
solution: I assume the basics of how it works also apply to node.js, minus the rendering step since that's only done in a browser, not in node. 

issue: Are you running in docker (withdocker run) or in docker-compose or in kubernetes or something else?

issue: tusharbudhe0302: It would be easier to read for us if you use proper Markdown syntax for your code/files that you paste. Are you getting any problems with your setup? Any error messages? 
solution: 

issue: GreenMonkeyBoy: That's really up to you. If you want to handle all errors the same way in all cases, just forward the error to the main error handler (last middleware).If you want to have specific cases, you might want to handle the errors in each route. I usualy end up doing something like:catch( commonErrorHandler(res) )wherecommonErrorHandleris a function that returns a function that receives the error object. If the error is transiant/temporary and it happens in a single route, terminating node seems a bit extreme. tusharbudhe0302: I think the OP wanted a way to report the error back, your solution does not provide that.

solution: 

issue: you can't use single quotes with template literals, you have to use back ticks. [<-LINK->] 
solution: Cant you just do 'amap.com' + ipAddress + 'restOfUrl' + theLastVariable. I mean if the api key gets assigned to a variable then you could use a template literal for that too and any other params but then you get a long run on string that soft wraps and looks ugly.. jakeb111: It can use that way which String append.. 

issue: skiv71: thanks for the explanation, I was confused about hoisting and scopes.. so you mean functions do not need to return anything? and everytime I set an external var inside the fn, it will overwrite the var that is outside or in other words globally declared? reesmanp: when you are taking about a functional language what do you mean?

issue: starting a uv event loop keeps it open... 
solution: 

issue: testtry1617: did it remove packages that you yourself installed and exist in yourpackage.jsonor did it remove packages only from thenode_modules?If the latter case, that is expected when those packages which were dependencies of other packages no longer are depended upon because of a change (like upgrading a package which no longer uses them), npm will remove the excess unused packagesIf it’s the first case (packages you installed explicitly and exist in package.json) then that shouldn’t happen.However if you installed a package via npm but didn’t save it to package.json, it can be cleaned up

issue: felixghislaindev: Yes, that was not necessarily meant to fix the issue you had, just a good practice to handle the error properly. As for your connection issue, I can connect to those ports from my laptop just fine. It sounds like whatever is running your code does not have network access to connect there.

issue: @mcarpenterjr Promises are not that hard, look at this post explaining promises using a comic: http://andyshora.com/promises-angularjs-explained-as-cartoon.htmlNow that post obviously uses old angularJS syntax, so here is a simplified ES version of the code: [<-CODE->] So what's the short pitch?A promise has 2 states, either fullfilled or not fullfilled. Fullfilled does not necesarily mean that the result is positive it is perfectly alright to resolve a negative reply, in this example, bad weather or a positive reply, good weather but sometimes the promise fails when that happens, log the error, and do appropriate actions in this case, that is the same action as a resolved promise with a negative answer Hope this helps

solution: 

issue: jasmeetsohal: i read that as well as the docs, but the part im unclear about is, lets say for CI, or for other deployments, does package-lock.json override package.json? 
solution: 

issue: only apps should have lockfiles tho, so you should disable and gitignore package-lock if you’re in a published package. no avonian: everything must always stay in package.json, with a at with a ^ package-lock is a complement; it can’t work alone. avonian: no, never remove the ^ the lockfile covers you fully without a lockfile, there’s nothing you can do to truly lock down your dep graph, even pinning versions in package.json

issue: Agreed. These services exist for a reason. The web isn't free. Neither is the content on it. Emails are content. It costs money in fact all of the email sending libraries in node... just use services... you're best bet would be nodemailer most likely(was checking to see if it's still maintained) unless you're in an AWS environment in which case their SDK will work just fine or any environment that provides it's own SDK that you can extract

However, it seems that due to Heroku FS, it never gets updated. Is there anyone who has gone through the same problem, and has solved it?

solution: 

issue: heroku support or docs might be a start? when would anyone ever want to usesocket.setNoDelay()? genuine question - im unfamiliar with that behavior 
solution: It is VERY RARE that you should ever set that. Ive been doing low level network programming for nearly 30 years including writing network stacks and cellular software  for major US carriers.. The existing algolrithm works very well. So unless you know about TCP packets, what sizes your connection is using, etc... and you wnat to custom fit packets and are doing some kind of times sensitive sending and optimization, I advise to never ever call setNoDelay.. 

issue: Communications that are time sensitive to even partial second delays and that cant use UDP because of routing or NAT traversal issues, or custom buffering code that knows the size of the underlying packets. This info however is typically not available (packet size of all transports) at higher network layers such as user code. if if 50/100 milliseconds (guessing on the number, Id have to dig to be precise) matter, then it can makes sense. But even then you have to then make sure all your data is buffered so you dont end up sending a zillion packets. Most times such needs use UDP instead, but there are many cases where UDP wont work or it has other problems.

I understand it will slow the start process, but for my needs I don\'t mind that. purefan: let me give it a shot it gives the same error:npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE\nnpm ERR! errno 1\nnpm ERR! javascript-development-environment@0.0.3 start: `npm audit && echo "hello"`\nnpm ERR! Exit status 1\nnpm ERR!\nnpm ERR! Failed at the javascript-development-environment@0.0.3 start script.\nnpm ERR! This is probably not a problem with npm. There is likely additional logging output above. I have only just started looking at npm/node properly in the past 2 weeks - I thought it might be to do with calling npm from within npm... but that is just pure guess work can anyone else verify if they have a similar issue trying@purefan's solution? I can try a clean project if it is only me that is running into it

issue: Hey guys, what good features do you suggest to add to my project: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Lol. $7.50 an hour? Thats a slap in the face even to an "intern" Thats only relevant if I was considering the job, which I'm not But as@ljharbmentioned, this isn't a place to advertise/spam, its to get assistance with Nodejs 
solution: 

issue: you can use ubuntu bash on windows 10, works great 
solution: 

issue: But I don't seem to be able to install  ubuntu in China 
solution: while using a linux sub system would be nice, NVM Windows should allow you to do some development no problem. You can use some cross platform libraries to allow for certain things to be doable no matter which system you're running on(like environment variables for NPM scripts), but otherwise if you can't install a linux sub system you should use NVM windows. 

issue: what about linux in Chine? doesn't work over there? xd 
solution: 没遇到过, 这个没被禁的. the "in china" part might mean you have trouble installing nvm, or downloading from nodejs.org. 

issue: what do you mean by implement elastic search ?  Not this [<-LINK->] ? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I need to use a scheduler of some sort, eg at 10pm on december 24 this year, run this function. What are some good options for this in node-js? 
solution: JLuboff: so it’s a “client” to add a real cron job?. 

issue: thomaspersson: are you using a cloud provider like AWS or GC or Azure? yes. They often have support for serverless code that can be run on a cron schedule. I've run daily cleaner scripts and many other such duties through the compute engines they provide 
solution: My use case is that I will have a database of “appointments” and eg one hour before appointment I want to invoke a function todo something, eg send out email or what ever. I must also be able to cancel and change time of previous schedulded appointment. The node.js scripts I have found is all in memory and no way of querying jobs, seems like I need to keep an array of refernce myself etc and that does not scale so good.. 

issue: I am currently working on a nodejs app, whenever a user sent a new request the admin should be notified without the the page reloading. I am making use of a nodejs serve-sent event and client side eventSource. but I am have some issues with it, it not updating as it should. pls is there any article that can help with this problem? 
solution: 

issue: dankaliyo: you are doing an async operation withsomeFunctionWIthACallback. if you want to printmyObjafter the values are inserted intomyObjthen you’ll also need to wrap yourmyFunctionas an async function to accept callback so thatmyFunctioncan call the passed callback when all the operation is finished the way to do that depends on the implementation. [<-CODE->] 
solution: (which in this case you are; just being clear :-) ). 

issue: ekarlso: ya think the short answer is yes.  modules are caches to later references use the same one; so if it has data in it it'ls the same. 
solution: 

issue: how can I do aggregate in mongoose by date property?this is not work, where is the problem? [<-CODE->] the problem is on the date objects, they does not be parsed as ISO format; 
solution: 

issue: is it asetter?  [<-CODE->] aaah Ok 
solution: 

issue: When your function is async, anything you return from it is wrapped in a Promise  [<-CODE->] For instance: [<-CODE->] calling foo still returns a Promise, even though the await keyword was used. 
solution: Yeah, you're right because it's a nativepromise, but when usingfetchAPI things are going to be different. 

issue: anyone have suggestions on a good runtime interpreter console/shell for node? something like PyCharm’s python console would be awesome Using VSCode right now but it’s not quite as full featured 
solution:

solution: 

issue: what reference error? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Im trying to send the hostname through to a InfluxDB but the result is 'undefined' im guessing its beacuse of a async function not being waited on. Im new to node :( so be kind... 
solution: 

issue: so an arrow function preserves the binding? i never knew that 
solution: 

issue: I'm getting a callback but I need to make sure this fs api implement what I need 
solution: because I also need a copyTpl function. to replace variable. 

issue: could anyone point me in the right direction here? [<-CODE->] It always fails to decrypt. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong and I'm a super noob at Crypto and I keep finding many ways to use it 
solution: alsoimport * asthere is flatly incorrect, that's typescript's broken modules implementation. you need to enable syntheticImports and/or esModuleInterop to fix that. 

issue: is it a deep copy or references for objects? i guess it's just for renaming/restructuring your own objects 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Can anyone help me? Im trying to get the hostname pushed to the DB, i can console.log it but when i call it inside the field i get an error.."Pulling DataDESKTOP-GTE5ISFError - Cannot read property \'os\' of undefined\'\' xoftware: no, i put it there to test that the promise works. Should i remove it? xoftware: Same error - Error result.os.hostname is not a function I get the result. I just cant call it inside the DB schema Yes sorry i had - result.hostname() if i remove that i get - invalid boolean 
solution: 

issue: The result being the parameters for the database query and the methods, eg the user clicks the remove comment button, the client sends to the server the username, the page_id (the page of the comment), and comment_id, plus the method being called "delete"? that\'s pretty much what it might look like you think? most of, if not all of, the requests are going to be database related I wanna find an exception to that, when would that not be the case? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] After running above code I'm getting this error in chrome console. Response for preflight does not have HTTP ok status. 
solution: 

issue: hello !Im trying to refactor my code and I was wondering is they were  a cleaner way  [<-CODE->] Anyone able to find if there is a more compact way ? I think its as little as it can be

solution: 

issue: yashwp: couple of ideas:check filesize/filetype before doing anything (somebody could upload 4gb executable file)\nmake everything async instead of sync (so as not to block the server - clients cannot connect during this)\nremove try/catch, and error out on each [async] step instead (try/catch is expensive, and probably not doing what you want here)\nput a timeout on the process/connection, if there isn't one already\npush upload percentage to the client, if that is possible yashwp: also, you could avoid doing all of this, if you used a site that allowed the client to directly upload to them, and then have the client javascript/api simply just send your server the link you may not have to reinvent the wheel, since you are not storing images on your server anyway 
solution: 

issue: God this is driving me nuts: [<-CODE->] okay I don't know what the problem is, but I got it to work using yarn in the  node.js CMD.  Not sure why npm and yarn in git bash are giving me troubles. 
solution:

solution: 

issue: abhiverma1924: that's not a node issue 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] can you help me how to resolve this issue guys ?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: I have a for loop and inside it I am calling a function which returns a promise, the problem is that the loop doesn't wait for the promise to get resolved and run fastly. Have tried to use async await but that's of no use,  Even used Promise.alll but that also is not doing the work 
solution: don't use a loop. use an array of functions, .map to get an array of promises, and pass that into Promise.all.

When I disable bodyParser(), it works fine. 
solution: 

issue: You can use es6 modules with the —experimental-modules flag and naming your files with the .mjs extension. I just use require though, i like babel for browser stuff. Don’t really like transpiling the nodejs code for some reason. So I can't use ES5 when trying that? So I can't use ES5 anymore with that? It gives me errors for "require" And babel doesn't seem to work.. I built the file required it.. And nothing

issue: charlesdarkwind: the point of an event emitter is that the code that's doing the triggering doesn't have to be tightly coupled to the code doing the listening. if it\'s "just a function" then both sides have to know about each other. kontributer: the only recovery is installing the needed peer deps. untilnpm lsexits zero, you can't rely on anything working, because your dep graph is invalid

solution: 

issue: mijatovicmile: I actually use_idfor mdb models,  thenidfor the graphql models. Everything is converted already in the backend, so that the frontend won't be dealing naming issues 
solution: I hope this may shed a light over your doubts :). 

issue: i do it that wayif on backend there is nothing only mongodb with _id, then i use it in front-end too.if backend uses different services with different naming conventions, then i have a dto model which i use everywhere (backend services, frontend) and special mappers for each services if there is need in mapping. 
solution: so, its about few mb in memorylru means that you have a limit of keys and old keys will be cleared if i remember correct meaning of lru.so, redis strategy is good if you will scale horizontally, and your new instances of app should not lose stored keysif you are not expecting that there will be more then one app instance lru is not necessaryany way, storing key in memory means that you will occasionally lose themif thats ok, then probably yes, you can store. 

issue: but i have a strong parallelpersonally, i am from strong typed stack, 19 years of ms sql, asp and .net.everything is typed :)and mongodb with nodejs is completely different - first feel, make everything strong typedbut the power of this stack is, in my opinion, is that its not strongly typed :) 
solution: 

issue: if you can fit your data in a table, use relational DB... if your table would frequently have many unused columns, then go for nosql like mongodb... depends on your needs ljharb: it seems you met a lot of pain with mdb hahaha SalathielGenese: have you ever used redis as a database? I only used it as an in memory cache... SalathielGenese: any issues so far? how's the overall experience? :)

issue: Hi so i am having an issue, i declared a variable updated it inside of a block and then in trying to access the updated variable outside the block it says that the variable is undefined? Confused on what to do 
solution: 

issue: thats because you are filling it in success callback and trying to get it value before it filled.  [<-CODE->] i believe, that if you are using async/await you should avoidvarand preferletandconstalso, if you are using async/await the you should not mix oldschool promises with await its recommendations, which will help you to better understand whats really happens in your code and when code should be like this (i am using arrow function because i do not need this context and less chars to write, but its not necessary [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] let result = JSON.parse(body);- this should be wraped in try catch, otherwise you can get here error its too late here and i make some typos in example, but i think its clear what i mean cursiv3: :) 
solution: 

issue: store token, not claims on client, and when you have to resolve route that is protected, send token to backend in order to check if its admin or not 
solution: 

issue: i wish the police delete criminals from their db you know, in case if you became a criminal just one time, by mistake.officer, this is last time, i promise, just delete me then every time will be "first" for you :) 
solution: When I set the JWT Token , I returned this information about admin. later when I automatically authenticate the user after refresh and If token expiration date is in the future. 

issue: and the last there are two approaches to generate access token string.first: token string contains all needed claims in it.second: token string points to some backend store where actual claims isso, token string  contains claims information  anyway. every your request goes to the server with access token, where you validate it. backend token response contains additional properties and you update your app state every time you get new token. [<-CODE->] and all you should store in localStorage is refreshtoken. you dont need isAdmin in local storage

Ok if it is worldwide then have you tried doing captcha ?  enable it for every form submit? taburetkin: @chrisdav6yeah that might work too.  I like doing captcha for all of my unauthenticated forms submission security standpoint 
solution: 

issue: it depends on the nature of your test. i believe (but can be definitely wrong) that you are not testing the case when your function invokes the method on given argumentbut something else

solution: I saw that a lot of developers used the Passport for Node.js authentication. Passport uses the concept of strategies to authenticate requests. Strategies can range from verifying username and password credentials, delegated authentication using OAuth (for example, via Facebook or Twitter), or federated authentication using OpenID.. 

issue: i can say, that jwt.sign is a method to make this magic :{ your json data } => abra-kadabra => 7sjshGs4hjbd2kasjhdm5askjh3djai wonder how do you check claims inside it 
solution: so, you can create it as random string, like you saw in some examples.jwt.signis just a one way to do that. and it can handle expiration of this token as a plus.refresh token body is not necessary, unless you are not going to use it at the refresh end point.i believe there is no need to pass user claims and userid will be enough.

issue: IMHO you should be using a client side library and api's as it sounds more like an app 
solution: 

issue: If you need to get something done and this is a small project, I would just look at how express serves assets. and then reference the validatorjs script in an html tag and just use vanilla javascript. react is more of a purists / fan boy tool damn, shots fired react is quite awesome, but it is a library not a framework. So if you go down that route, be prepared to make lots of decisions 
solution: flores: yeah... was thinking of using an event listener and validating with validator.... seems the quickest way and will cause the least amount of hair-pulling. 

issue: It is easy enough to do with node to where you get the client side rendering so I doubt it is something they don't do

issue: danilosilvadev: CORS is a very important security feature, designed to block some very nasty cyberattacks. The best solution would be to serve your client page with an HTTP server installed on the same system where you're running the NodeJS application.

solution: 

issue: HiI\'ve been reading express quickstart and stumbled upon thisThe req (request) and res (response) are the exact same objects that Node provides, so you can invoke req.pipe(), req.on(\'data\', callback), and anything else you would do without Express involved.What do they mean here by "Node provides"? What does node provide? From the examples of what I can invoke it seems like they're streams, is it what they meant? Sounds like they meant something else... Hmm I guess that's Node.http req/res objects Makes sense then

issue: Hello,I have a socketio app where I am calling the methods dynamically on the class based on the type of event received from the client. [<-CODE->] The issue is that now I have so many events defined on the controller. How can I split my controller into multiple files and yet call these methods dynamically? Yes, but I can't repeatthis.client.onlistener in multiple controllers taburetkin: it runs the code multiple times. taburetkin: I have some other logic underthis.client.onlike reporting the events to anayltics. If the code runs multiple times, the event is reported multiple times. 
solution: Earlier I had separate controllers, but I wanted all the events to intialize at once so I combined the controllers. 

issue: u can use several controllers tannakartikey: why not? 
solution: 

issue: That might be a reason that I have not found any example of this done. Can't find best practices or even anything similar. But I need to have this functionallity, I don't know how to achieve one without mixing.So my approach was this. I have that backend and frontend code in the module(that is in the backend). When the dev servers starts or build in production, all those frontend components of a module get synced(basically copied and pasted into react app) to frontend so that webpack picks that up and builds frontend. In dev environment this so called syncer works all the time, watches over the files and syncs them.I need to version frontend and backend code of a module together, and I could not find any other approach. I am still novice in MERN, so I might be sooooo wrong and realise it at a later date. 
solution: I don\'t quite get what you mean.I think(i might be wrong) I have something like that. I do backend code which has all the essential logic for the application, server, some custom tools, Mongo scripts ets and for the frontend I have react application which has common components like nav, containers grid etc. All this makes base application and fully functional.Let\'s say that I want chat functionality. I build a Chat module, which has backend logic and frontend code ONLY regarding the chat. My sort of bas application will work with or without this chat module. But if I decide to have Chat, I will bring in this module, and if I decide not to have, I simply remove it. it is optional in every case.I think i get where are you going with environment change, but there is no plan to change it at all.Also more information, this "base" application. That application almost never changes. Only these feature/extra modules will change. For example I have version 2.1.12 of base aplication, and I need to debloy version 1.1.12 of the chat module. With this approach I can do this. And this is exactly what I need to have. Different deployments will have to have different versions of this chat module specified by a customer..
