solution: 

issue: I am new to Ethereum...Is it a public block chain thats already running? If i have to use Ethereum for supply chain, do i have to create a block chain network within my organization/groups on top of Ethereum by writing smart contracts? Is that how it works? Just confused with the work public .. 
solution: learninghuman: Ethereum have a public blockchain, usaully called main chain. But you can run private chains with arbitrary rules. It's not a standard enforced, but if you follow, your token will be automatically recognized by all software, like ethcore/parity ethereum/mist myetherwallet.com and descentralized exchanges aswell. 

issue: and i can write my own smart contracts for my solution? let me put it this way....so if i have run the supply chain business network in Ethereum, i have to create my own token, smart contarcts and request my suppliers , other partiies to join the network through ethereum membership services all adhering to the out of the box conensus model from the platform? Is this understanding rt?

issue: Hi, i am doing investigation now and i would need your help with one of my questions. How fast can one value (e.g. measurement value) be updated (and confirmed so it is a valid transaction ) in ledger? Is writing frequency only depended on the speed of the miners?  Thank you very much... 3esmit: , Thank you for your explanation.  so if I want to play "according to rules" there is no guaranty that e.g. i could validate my transaction in let say 1s interval, thus i can not use it for realtime use cases (e.g. instant messaging, or sending back and forth some realtime data?) 
solution: 

issue: Hello Ethereum pro's.I still reading up on ethereum trying to grasp as much as I can.As ethereum is opensource anyone could setup their own blockchain, correct? Then this one could be public or privat depending on what you want with it. So in a couple of years it could be a bunch of public blockchains available.If I then want to do some mining the choice of blockchain to mine for would be the one with the most transactions and fewest miners would be the best choice?Does this even make sense? My question I mean.

Good thing I didn't have any main net accounts. 3esmit: I'm on Mac OS X. chafey: I have updated Ethereum Wallet to 0.8.9 by dragging the downloaded file onto my Applications folder and choosing "Replace" when it told me there was an existing version of the wallet.

solution: 

issue: willnwhite: always make backups of your account keys, make sure they are safe, if you lose them you won't be able to access your funds, so any hardware or software failure won't be trouble. Ethereum Wallet changed the folder where the keys are stored, your old ones are not lost, they are in the old place (that path depends if you are in unix based system or windows).

The web page tells me to create a contract, but I can't find any guidance on how to do this. CoPay makes the transfer of BitCoin very easy, and I would like to transfer the 100 ether to my newly created MyEtherWallet but the ether seems to be in the ether. Can anyone help?

issue: Dear friends, I have a doubt about Smart Contracts. I understand what gas is and why it is needed to support Ethereum BlockChain. What I want to clarify is: Do I make any money if I deploy some Smart Contract to Ethereum BlockChain and someone use my functions? Lets suppose I deploy an important mathematic calculation contract. Do I earn any money (i.e. Ether) if other users call my function?

issue: Hi there, I really want to get serious about ethereum, but since my first attempts about 5 weeks ago the node (now updated to the latest macOS version) has simply never downloaded... what can I do? Bschuster3434: Version 0.8.9 License GPL-3.0

solution: 

issue: ethereum has a cost to use, that is not going awaybut it is possible if there is a transition to Proof of Stake? 
solution: Instead of paying people to donate computational power, you're paying people to keep their Ethereum on the Network. If there was no reason for miners to keep nodes running on the network, then the network falls apart.

solution: 

issue: MahenRathod_twitter: AFAIK you can't (yet?) transfer USD to Ether and vice versa directly. Ways to get ether are mining, buying on an exchange or getting someone to send it to your ethereum address. Once you have ether on an address you could send this to an exchange, sell it for USD and then transfer the USD to your bank account. This last transaction would not be stored on the blockchain, but all the aeforementioned would (as transferrals from one address to another) MrRootx_twitter: If you know your transaction hash or address look them up on [<-LINK->] and make sure the ether was transferred

If setting up tokens that work as markers of value/membership how much ETH am I looking per membership to keep it running?

So, it's like lunyr tokens, just by adding "watch contract" with contract address and then you can see LUN tokes balance. Even though@patrick.wetrust at WeTrust slack channel suggested me to do it better with MEW 1st until they enabling everything to support Mist & Parity. So. MEW will be my TRST ethereum token wallet. :)

issue: Haha I made this mistake when I first downloaded ethereum wallet@JosephIanF_twitter. First question, windows or mac? and also, at the top of ethereum wallet GUI, how many blocks does it say you have left to download? so good news is your coin has almost certainly been sent to your account already, and is very safe there. If you want to confirm, look up the address you sent it to on [<-LINK->] “bad” news is that you’ll have to download the whole blockchain before you can access those funds from within Ethereum Wallet. If you’re getting a node error, you’ll need to delete the~/Library/Ethereum/geth/chaindatafolder (on a Mac) and start downloading the chain from scratch.  [<-CODE->] That has your encrypted private key and if you delete that you’ll never be able to access the funds in that account.

issue: good morning.  I am new to this site , and curious about Ethereum.  Do all blockchains work on Ethereum? 
solution: As people/businesses start to use blockchain technology for anything from currency to smart contracts, they must be verified correct?  I guess my basic question is can any blockchain be verified on the Ethereum network, or must the blockchain be built ON that network?  I mean, can you verify a bitcoin blockchain on Ethereum?.

issue: Everyone good day.  I was wondering if you have  heard of this happening....before ETH (now known as ETC) hard fork last year I bought all my ETH my coins, the after fork, I updated my wallet and all my coins came over fine.  Yesterday however I discovered a LOT of coins under my address on the old blockchain ETC....any ideas ?   I am wondering if someone didn't send me some coins by mistake.  Also, just in case you are wondering,  I made no transactions after the hard fork, and never did any on the ETC block chain.  I would appreciate your comments. 
solution: Well, if the coins duplicate on both blockchains, that would be a real instant wealth boom for everyone, seems strange.  Also, the amount of coins that came over, correctly was 1920, and the ones I found on ETC now are 513.  So, doesn't seem that they were duplicated, something else apparently has occurred.

solution: tayhabbe_twitter: so you have trouble syncing the client Software. Be patient or try a light-client. 

issue: So, kind of a stupid question. I thought I saw something, somewhere, sometime ago that said you can run a eth node, and by running the node you can earn ether? Am I mistaken? 
solution: 

issue: robipuha_twitter: you dont have to sync the hole chain from scratch every time. The client only syncs the block it hasnt already processed. You were probably never fully synced or you were synced to the testnet or you startet your client in testnet.I know having a synced full node is difficult. Perhaps you can try starting the client in light mode. robipuha_twitter: when you have like 3.6 million block your fully synced to the mainnet. for light start mist --node-light

Please help me,Do I have a chance to get the money back? Respects 
solution: recaiy: your money is fine aslong as you have a backup of the key. You can search for your TX in an blockexplorer like etherscan.io , if you dont want to wait for a fully synced node you can try a light client like myether wallet or jaxx or start mist in lightmode. 

issue: lukas-berlin: there are only 2 folders over there: geth, keystore. Opening geth folder give you access to 3 more folders: chaindata; ethash; nodes. So which one is installation folder? I will need delete the chain data and start over again. Something is wrong and it stack at 2,6M blocks. Sometime it show progress till 1.4M but then again went back to the same 2.6M blocks.

issue: I'm trying to create a node via CLI, but I can't use EthConsole without a node already running. How am I supposed to start one without EthConsole? robipuha_twitter: Which method are you looking to use to buy your Ethers? There is a billion exchanges and shops. But to answer your question, theoretically you won't lose them. Make sure to backup your keyfile following the 321 rule. In other words, the 3-2-1 backup rule means you should: Have at least three copies of your data. Store the copies on two different media. Keep one backup copy offsite. So something like, one on your drive, one on a thumb drive, and one on the cloud.

issue: Try this one for a good profit... 0.0001 Eth hourly [<-LINK->] Oh... my wrong... 0.001Eth hourly... Excuse me =D 
solution: 

issue: So if you can't REVEAL your bids you lose your ETH invested.  How convenient for some one...  Who designed this ENS REGISTRAR??  Someone who knew they were gonna make a killing off of dumb bidders?? No support or communication at all.  Another failure on top of already many made. It's not as though I can decide whether to reveal or not.  It can't be done now. How do you know whether the developers get any or not? The website itself is being hit so many times its experiencing an ongoing denial of service attack. importing bids seemed to work after a few tries. I'm happy now. Thanks@nourharidy

issue: hi friends - what is the best source of reference for starting to mine ether on mac and windows? 
solution: 

issue: unilarry: there is published verified contract that you can read to ensure the terms of your interaction with the contract. Any terms published on the ENS registrar are enforced upon everyone, the developers included, thanks to the contract. unilarry: there are also alternative DApps that give you access to the ENS registrar contract directly instead of the official dapp, in case you're facing issues with the web dapp

issue: Hi, what's the best waller to hold eth like an electrum wallet for eth. That works on android ryanio: so its not usable yet u mean? 
solution: 

issue: I think the pattern is to have your top-level contracts call interfaced contracts, which can change if need be.  eg:contractAcallscontractB.someMethod(), wherecontractBimplements some interface.  InsidecontractA, the address ofcontractBcan be changed so that it points to a newer version ofcontractBthat still implements the interface.  ThuscontractB.someMethodwould point to a different contract's function than before The problem is getting your interface right the first time around. I'm not at all seasoned with Solidity so take what I said with a grain of salt ;)

Just want a safe offline storage option..

issue: Dudes, I need help IDK why ethereum block and chain structure stop downloading all of a sudden I keep having to close and reopen ethereum wallet 
solution: 

issue: it stops or it pauses? if you stop it and restart it it will sync much smaller only from scratch it is in fast mode rename the chain data dir and restart parity is another wallet Kaden_Music_twitter: search for your ethereum data dir and there will be a dir named geth and inside a dir named chaindata if you stop the sync it will sync the rest much slower once you restart it Kaden_Music_twitter: start at 0 and let it sync until the chain is up to date

issue: Hey I'm new to Ethereum. I downloaded the wallet from ethereum.org.  At the start of the set up Ethereum  asked me to deposit/buy ethereum, so I did with bitcoins of my electrum wallet. Since then the ethereum wallet is syncing and about 35 hours(!!!!) have passed. Now I'm in my ethereum wallet and not sure if it is done syncing. There is still  a message saying "waiting for blocks". The wallet shows that I have 0 ether. But I should have 0.4 ether.  Is the wallet still not fully synced ? Does my money appear if it's fully synced  or  did I loose my money somehow ?

solution: 

issue: I have made a few custom contracts under an account I own. Each contract has ethereum in it now. How do I get money out of the contracts and back to my account wallet?? Everytime I try to send, it only lets me send "from" my account wallet, and not "from" my contracts. How did you put it in? Normally takes about 20 minutes. Took me almost a day yesterday and I'm not sure why 
solution: 

issue: dumb question.  How long should I expect it to take until my desktop wallet sees that I put Ether in it? Is it just a matter of time to wait for the blocks to sync? Transfered from Coinbase, it shows my correct balance on etherescan Ugh, weird.  Yeah it's been a few days for me actually.  I think that bouncing around from shitty cafe wifi to shittier cafe wifi may be partially to blame thanks

issue: comments on this really appreciated!!    I'm trying to understand a key issue with ethereum - to educate my organization.      When new distributed applications, like Golem, Augur, Opus, or Filecoin, are created...and they use their own (ERC20?) token, are they, by definition, built upon their own separate instance of the Ethereum blockchain, or are they running on the Main Ethereum Network? I'm really sorry if this has been asked a million times before. Thanks!!! 
solution: dapps run on something called "gas" which is a "fuel" consumed on each computational step that the ethereum virtual machine executes. Gas must be purchased every time an contract code is executed. As a consequence, dapps only use the blockchain for crucial tasks..

solution: erofan22wwwed: to which address was the money sent to. as@phalexosaid, finish syncing your wallet. erofan22wwwed: either sync your wallet or download metamask for example, and import your wallet. 

issue: TheGreatNiphalexo: are there other coins that are more profitable? I was under the impression you could make they much per day 
solution: matrixbot: I am not aware of any. It used to be more profitable when the difficulty level was much lower, but that was 2 years ago. 2 years ago it was possible to buy Ether for 30cents for 1 ether. You can go to coinmarketcap.com to check out all the coins.. TheGreatNiphalexo: looks like monero is on the low rn, maybe I'll try mining that....

issue: Hello theer - how is it that I create a wallet?  What is the safest way to get my eth into my paypal account? 
solution: 

issue: I want to help with development with Ethereum during my spare 3 weekdays and maybe some more time on weekends. I think the research projects are most important at the moment to get Ethereum more scalable and with PoS. I was learning Solidity, then was learning LLL, and now I am having some issues continuing, so I am reading the Yellow Paper, while hopefully the issues will be fixed soon. [<-ISSUE->]  [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: Use a proxy and new address phalexo: Prove you're not a human. What is 0.01+0.04? 
solution: I exist for your death, not your entertainment.. 

issue: hegrz: Here some entertainment, I don't  mind, really! As I am working on a token, I am trying to understand how I should future proof it, and build in functionality to swap the current token for some future token that may be developed later. There are pay/sell functions floating around that allow users to buy tokens for ether, and also sell tokens back to a contract in exchange for ether. I'd like to enable functionality to buy one token by spending another token (and bypass ether route as that could cause issues.) Any thoughts from anyone? Thanks._ The name is often initialized by a contract constructor. It does not need to be hard-coded. 
solution: 

issue: Where do I need to register to conduct my ICO on this platform and what should I download? I can not even work with my wallet 
solution: 1) you need a wallet. I recommend myetherwallet. No because it's a huge task and varies from group to group. Most importantly, you need to learn/understand the technology. And English, man. You can’t live without that. Not in this medium.. 

issue: ayager22511_twitter: Is it mostly based on open source or did you implement  a lot of custom functionality? Aminadav: When a single node finds a solution, sometimes very fast, everyone else drops that problem. Moreover, mining pools divide  work among many miners. It is not simply multiplied by "1000."

solution: 

issue: Is a contract cost creation on rinkeby good indication of what it would be on mainnet? If so, I can't afford to make any mistakes. 0.35+ rinkeby ether. 
solution: hipposuppo: Just run a miner on a subset of GPUs. If you have only 1 GPU it is not worth bothering with mining..

solution: 

issue: how do you add funds to the ether wallet. I am receiving a notification saying not to transfer 
solution: 

issue: Aminadav: You pay not only to send the data, but also to run the code that handles the data So you are paying for extra storage It's just not an exponential payment system (well, in USD it is due to ETH prices rising and then gas is going up in general on its own... but that's not because of the contract) ^^Yeah. But adding three characters shouldn't cost more compared to a 6k string or a 1k string Unless just accessing that memory adds cycles Which it would... minorly Independently Pools are coordinated tchoua08: Buy  it? And is this is an Ethereum chatroom, not Bitcoin lol tchoua08: A currency? 
solution: Providing a P2P, trusted environment, without needing your own network/blockchain. 

issue: hi~ nice to meet you I'd like to ask a question. my ERC20 token can't verify. Somebody help me?! 
solution: 

issue: u can restrict the funds to certain vendors who want to play by the rules,  for certain products and services. Or setup various accounts(using iterations of code) for the transfer of funds. The real question is... how do we identify people who need funding? but I feel like that could be solved pretty quickly... Im sure if we contacted habitat for humanity they could  help define a flow chart. 
solution: I am sure there are, just not following on the premise that a smart contract can be of help vs dedicated wallets and a central distribution point for donations, but yes, contacting someone on the ground could be all that it takes..

issue: kayabaNerve: Thanks for replying! The smart contracts use events to send info to the higher level interface (I'm planning to use web3.js) which then interacts with the storage. The flow of information only goes one way, but since the contract-storage interaction is also one way (contract alters storage) it'll prob be fine. I'm kinda new to all this, so if I'd done anything wrong some feedback would be appreciated:) kayabaNerve: To be perfectly honest with you, I don't really know...As I said, I'm new to this, so this is like my learn-by-doing project...I haven't got the time to read through the IPFS docs yet, so I can't give you anything more that what I just did.

issue: SteveMiddle12_twitter: You have to design "upgrade" functionality into your project. So you need  a very well tested and simple "router" contract that you don't need to update that  routes to a more functional contract. As an alternative a contract should have a way to be decommissioned and only leave a forwarding address to its successor, etc... So, it  is not trivial, and easy to mess up. SteveMiddle12_twitter: As I said before, you have to design your contract(s) in such a way that you could move balances to a new contract.  The new contract will have a different address, etc... Period. CraigJCarter23_twitter: Your problems are not technical, but arise from lack of understanding that your wallet knows nothing about balances. You have to sync your wallet to the blockchain. kayabaNerve: It's not as trivial as it might seem.

Like i know I wasnt scammed because they acknowledged accepting ETH from me and I can see the KIN sitting Etherscan that were transferred to me for the ICO, but the only issue is for some reason it is showing 0 KIN tokens in my wallet 
solution: Fakesuncheezy_twitter: The fact that you see it on Etherscan is meaningless. The only thing that means anything is whether or not you are controlling that account. You should carefully compare the account number you see on Etherscan and the one you see in  the Wallet. If they are different and you are synced, you might have a big problem..

solution: 

issue: Please excuse my ignorance, but I am new to ethereum and I would like to ask a question that, hopefully, someone can answer. I wish to create a new cryptocurrency for my local community. However, once this is done there will be certain restrictions on the use of the currency, which will need to be encoded. My question is this, do the restrictions have to be encoded when the contract is initialized, or can it be encoded at a later date once the community has decided what all the restrictions are? Once again, I hope I am not making an idiot of myself with this question, so please bear with me. Thank you.

issue: phalexo: I think you misunderstood - their service provider was blocking Javascript (JSON) files - so they never got downloaded.  The TCP session was reset.  Thus they were never delivered and the email archival never recorded a received email.  If the original encrypted keys was never delivered then the transaction was not completed - this was brought up to Ethereum.org within one week of the genesis block being issued, so there was ample time for the keys to be resent or reissued, but they were not.   So who is the appropriate POC at Ethereum.org to resolve this?

issue: Having an absolutely horrendous time on Binance/Bitfinex which isn't allowing me to send funds to it due to: "Identification issues" and no response from their support team. Stuck with 74k IOTA in my wallet that I can't sell I'd love to just sell off a bunch of this for eth because frankly I am no longer a fan of IOTA and the exchanges that support it. I'll of course go first and we would trade in small increments to mitigate risk. This sucks but it's my only option. KenoLeon: IOTA is the first crypto currency to not utilize the block chain. Instead it uses tangle which allows for infinite scalability and free transactions. it's mainly targeted towards micro transactions that would be fractions of a cent: e.g. paying for a cell phone plan per second of data used as opposed to a flat monthly rate a lot of different uses are being figured out... like using the iota technology to send encrypted messages over its platform

There pre-exists a P2P application doing just that ( except that it use GUI for a person to do the work.). In Proof of Work version of Protein folding, you compute the thermodynamics... it should not be too hard to verify either... Just throwing out an idea as my view on Proof of Stake is it makes the coin production a bit too easy...

He said yes. However, after I did, Kraken account says 0 and they say no transactions have done. I don't have transaction ID that Kraken asks me. I asked the person who gave me ETH for free. Later, he said his ETH that he gave to me was for TEST. But why he didn't tell me in advance and I can tranfer ETH to my Korean bank? I asked about this to him and he said he thought I had another ETH. It is wierd. But I saw changing $ everyday. and I can create my store and sell, buy ETH for myself. I have wallet but I have ETH 0 on that, I transferred from my smartphone android ETH application to Kraken. How can I attach picture file here?

issue: i'm a newby in ether coding. installed mist with testnet. can anyone answer : is it possible to make corrections in the contract ? yes so i will have bunch of contracts? i can't see any ways to delete the contract Avios64: thanks anyway for answering 
solution: 

issue: coreman000: You mean you deployed a contract want to update it? Upgradeable contracts are possible, but not through the default method of development & deployment. you'd be better off just deploying again. coreman000: You can't delete it. It's on the chain now. You can just ignore it though. Having a bunch of contracts is not inherently bad. You could just remove it ifrom Mist so it doesn't even appear in your interface. Actually that's a lie, youcansuicide contracts

issue: TarikMesanovic: same here. Did you read my messages? I've been dealing with issues downloading the blockchain with geth all month! With "Mist Wallet" downloading has now stopped at block 4,465,099 and now it is Downloading the "structure". It had reached 15 million blocks but I thought that was impossible since there is currently on 4.5 million blocks. I re-started Mist Wallet and now it is downloading the structure again and it's at 2.4 million blocks - I have not been able to begin my developer training because of this, but now the "test net" blockchain is completely downloaded and I'm waiting on the "main" blockchain to finish (if it doesnt get stuck again). I can't do anything until this finishes... :(

issue: hey guys I am new to Eth, but not new to Blockchain though my question is what can you do with smart contract? 
solution: “The best way to describe smart contracts is to compare the technology to a vending machine. Ordinarily, you would go to a lawyer or a notary, pay them, and wait while you get the document. With smart contracts, you simply drop a bitcoin into the vending machine (i.e. ledger), and your escrow, driver’s license, or whatever drops into your account. More so, smart contracts not only define the rules and penalties around an agreement in the same way that a traditional contract does, but also automatically enforce those obligations.”.

Had no idea it would take this long and have no idea where my Ether is.. Can someone help me? Thanks@KenoLeon, I was just looking at etherscan now.. It was only .24 ether anyway so not a big deal.. Found it! Any recommends for an online wallet? Yeah I'm using blockchain.info on my phone but was not able to import the Mist wallet yet 
solution: 

issue: Ldweisser: : The initial sync can take days or even not be possible depending on your hardware, if you need quick access to your funds you could try opening an online wallet with your Mist credentials, another alternative is to use a light client like parity (although right now you might be understandably reticent due to their exploit) if you have your txHash you can also check a block explorer like etherscan for peace of mind. I like Blockchain.info, but not sure if you can import from mist, myetherwallet is popular, just make sure you go to the right site, there's a few scam impostor ones. Ldweisser: Yeah, not sure if the web version has that functionality, you could try that, else you could try myetherwallet.

issue: Hi, just a short question, if i download the client from the ethereum website. This is not the Mist client right ? ahh okay yes the ethereum wallet exactly. this will download the full chain right ? and the website redirected me to the github release page from mist ( [<-LINK->] ) linux but thats the wallet and i am trying to understand is this Mist ? and if yes why ? because i thought mist is a light client which does not download the complete chain and if not where can i find mist because i installed it before but can not remember from which source exlemor: so there is not light client ? 
solution: exlemor: i accept the from marketing stand point  not being sexy. "Simulation" - replace 'S' with 'R' -Real world. I would be happy to have you as my mentor if you agree. We are here not dreaming about ICO. We started with simple problem buying a chemical 'Kcl' from alibaba.we wanted to buy in single click.  We went -1 step we found a problem in product classification , so we wanted a self evolving product chain that would solve that problem. Then we wanted a digital pool for all orders in the world which could identify the voids in the supply chain and creates opportunity. To make these ideas sustainable we invented few methods through which rimulation can be achieved. When we heard about EVM we wanted to have a single exchange medium which should be backed by goods produced and service provided. Which is when "Rimule" was coined..

solution: 

issue: Eth addresses don't include an internal checksum like bitcoin addresses, so it's possible to send Eth into oblivion a lot easier. Hopefully you just didn't pay enough gas and the tx will eventually fall out of mempool...

The node responsible for checking the balances is not responding, if the issues persists please contact us" anyone else having issues? 
solution: vin_bairi_twitter: Smaller altcoins will appear to "grow faster" because they are more volatile. If you like taking on a bunch of risk for profit, sure, buy a bunch of those and then sell them off later. In terms of value that will LAST? The ones with high market cap and good tech are your  best bet. BTC's tech SUCKS but it has the market cap to be safe. ETH has 2nd highest market cap and excellent tech to back it up, so it's probably even better long-term..

solution: 

issue: BeaconPark: how do they do verified on-chain computations, then? 
solution: Also, to anyon who might know: is there a way to increase the gas price for a pending transaction that isn't getting mined?. BeaconPark: I mean verified the way the Ethereum network verifies things, like to make sure tokens aren't stolen or minted without the proper permissions, etc. I think you can resend it by increasing the gas and it will be mined faster... since the miners first pick the high gas transaction... to make more... 

issue: I've increased the gas. but still my transactions remain pending. What happened ?

solution: 

issue: Jesin: im not an expert, but afaik a bubble pops when the actual & estimated value of a commodity are heavily out of sync. In case of cryptocoins there doesn't seem to be a commodity (flowers,metal,gold) behind it, but just trust. how would you define the difference between a 'pop' and a bearish movement? 
solution: coderofsalvation: the "commodity" is bitcoins, a currency whose primary utility lies in its ability to be transferred safely via the bitcoin network. The "bubble" would be the disparity between the price as tied to its ability to safely store and transfer value, vs the price paid by people who simply want to sell it to someone else at a higher price.. 

issue: You can be sure that when we would talking whole month about btc you alway would read "But nobody knows when the bubble will burst" But just the fact that price is still increasing will left... But big money is behind btc not cause of its utility There is something else what makes this coin special 
solution: LeVent5789_twitter: It is special because of greed and general insanity that runs in the human race..

solution: 

issue: hello every one. i deployed a smart contract last night, and my token was not rewarded. please what could be the problem? git-akira: i got the solidity code from proof platform and i deployed it on github 
solution: The inherited characteristic "mortal" simply means that the greeter contract can be killed by its owner, to clean up the blockchain and recover funds locked into it when the contract is no longer needed. Contracts in ethereum are, by default, immortal and have no owner, meaning that once deployed the author has no special privileges anymore. Consider this before deploying..

issue: deshraj_rana_twitter: Think of crypto currencies as gold. There is only so much of it, and has accumulated value because of the scarcity and versatility of the curreny. An advantage to crypto currencies, is the ability to send this currency across the world in a matter of seconds, miliseconds  even. And crypto currencies can be in a way tangible, because you can carry them on a specialized flash drive, i have forgotten the name of it. Also when purchasing something, crypto currencies enable you to make a purchase with any crypto at anywhere in the world. My guess is that it has the potential to become a universal currency.

issue: abbagarba1_twitter: I'd just read your message earlier. The ETH GHOST protocol seems to be very complex. The code that manages this must run on every full node for every block. it implies a lot of extra traffic on the network and it still does not prevent a larger pool from dominating the mining.

issue: @phalexo @Dumb_Stir_Fry_twitterPerhaps the best example is "the success of Satoshi Nakamoto". He invented blockhains, get others to "freely" - promotes BTC, creates more blockchains/cryptocurrencies, creates ICOs, etc.  Just my 2 cents quick-reference.Another quick reference I've been reading - https://www.investinblockchain.com/10-most-successful-icos/ Dumb_Stir_Fry_twitter: I've been trying Googling... But seems even Google can't find him/her? Hehehe!

[UnQuote]As for the second one, I wonder there's is any organisation/company starting up a venture to promote/use blockhains as the new CrytoRegistry/CryptoSocialSecurityNumber? This would be a good venture.! If yes, by all means do contact ME! SERIOUSLY - I'm interested! And should we called it  - CryptoSocialSecurityNumber ?

solution: If you apply for a government grant I bet you could get one. It is the other way around. Before you can apply for a grant you'd need one. It may be different in the down  under.. 

issue: You can probably find people who have experience writing grants around the bigger universities. Probably find people already getting crypto grants Some incubator sites are companies that spin off from research grants at universities. Around here there are alot of engineered ceramic start ups The first send but it can't be sent means it is trapped

solution: Rogeman_twitter: Not able to comment at this time.. @Rogeman_twitter    However of the "issue" would be  that the clock on your computer is close to real time.

issue: nadil017_twitter: try getting help here nadil017_twitter: can you provide the tx-hash your gas price is way too low, yes you can cancel tx, by sending another tx with higher gas price with the same nonce yes the replacement tx can be an empty tx Myetherwallet has a tool for this. Go on "Check TX Status" on MEW nadil017_twitter:  [<-LINK->] nadil017_twitter: you have to send another tx, as descibed in the link I provided melzohery: can you provide a tx-hash? 
solution: So you send from an exchange to a contract. It failed and didnt show up again in your account. You should contact the support of the Exchange. 

issue: i want to cancel the whole process? the gas price was send to me by credits ico? 
solution: Just overwrite with higher gasPrice, with the same transaction as last time, if you still want it. Remember to use the same nonce.. If an empty txn is used then gas will be lost, if he still wants that transaction..

issue: Hi all, quick question. What's the right place in the eth repos to look for key generation? Elphax89_twitter: I don't think the Foundation's email is going to help. They don't have a way of getting your money back. mounika23_twitter: Eth is open source, but what you're looking for is Ganache. Look for it at truffleframework.com It's a test platform that simulates a blockchain, so you don't need to be actually running a node or use (even test) Eth. The next step in production is usually to release to a test net - those are real online networks, but the eth is 'play' eth, not the real thing you buy on an exchange. Once you work it all out, then you can talk about going live with it.

solution: 从区块链历史上来说，先诞生了比特币，当时并没有区块链这个技术和名词，然后业界从比特币中提取了技术架构和体系，称之为区块链技术。从比特币提取的区块链技术称之为区块链1.0时代，那个时候的应用主要以电子货币和去中心化交易为主，比如各种山寨币。而以太坊将区块链带入了2.0的时代，区块链2.0不是推翻了1.0，而是在1.0的基础上实现了区块知晓、价值知晓、图灵完备，并进行了细节优化，从而形成了以智能合约为特色的区块链2.0。比特币定位于一个应用，而以太坊定位于平台，你可以在这个平台上利用智能合约做各种应用。.

issue: Hi all, I'm finding that an Ethereum (public or private) blockchain really isnt suited for storing large amounts of data.Does anyone happen to have any recommendations for a different blockchain that is suited for this purpose? AliceTheHive: ahh yes I've heard about the CryptoKitties clutter, however from my experience, even a private Ethereum chain doesn't do well with storing and retrieving large amounts of data ! Looks like I gotta do some research

solution: 

issue: I'm trying to understand the basic eth-powered web-app dynamics.  What's an ideal sort of token flow for setting users up on a site and allowing them to use tokens for various actions?  It seems like every user would need an address... so would you run geth on the backend and create a bunch of accounts like you would with bitcoind?  Then, sending tokens could be expensive gas-wise... so do you setup off-chain token banking on the site, then allow withdrawals? ONLIMAKE: Is that a standard way of issuing tokens to users, by having them confirm the TxHash after payment?  Why not use a separate contract that issues tokens when it receives ether? ONLIMAKE: Ah, I'm new as well.  I'm still at the testnet blockchain sync stage, just trying to understand the best use practices or how to bootstrap a site with a smart contract I've seen a lot of exciting sounding whitepapers, but few practical guides 
solution: rtbz_twitter: There are no guides, I think that's why they do not want to enter the market, they understand almost everything except uploading to the image (logo) of the token, if you like it, I explain everything in private, but they create a site with a token, you can not, but you can help create an ICO, if that's what you want to do.

I would contact the exchange’s support staff  [<-LINK->] does not see any transaction with that hash It means that EtherScan, a third party company with highly connected Ethereum nodes, has never seen a transaction with that hash. When mining a block, many different people could come up with a valid block at the same time If this happens, then only one will end up being used when the next block is built on top of it this results in miners spending time (aka money) mining a block, doing it right, and then not getting rewarded these blocks that are valid, but not included in the chain are commonly called “uncles” or “orphans" Ethereum includes references to these “uncles” so that the miners can still be rewarded for the work, even if the block is not going to be included directly in the chain, see this article for a more detailed description: [<-LINK->]

I can help you track your funds and help you figure out what address it's under, and we can figure out what encryption is in place. I have no intent on scamming you or accessing your private keys etc., but I think I can help deduce what happened to your funds. Reach me@jderocon twitter.

issue: adirmola: As long as you implement the ERC20 required methods, you can add any other functionality you need. You have to worry of course about ensuring that additional functions are secure, etc... sera_schiffmann_twitter: What you are describing is an ERC20 utility token, and yes tokens can be used as a form of payment, assuming that its users have confidence that the token carriesvalue.

solution: 

issue: gasperko: Banning any one specific id is a totally fruitless exercise. The slimy thief  would simply set up a new id. If someone could write a bot, I saw it done before, for this channel that looks for words like "help" etc..., and prints a message to NOT share keys, passwords, seeds, etc... it would help. It is simply a matter of making scamming less successful, more costly in time.

For posts containingminingormineprint some url with info.  Posts containing links to eitherscan  usually result in answers about syncing to the chain, or that transactions are immutable. You have to deal with your burdens. Some NLP models I've built take up 50GB of RAM. Probably not the way to go.

issue: Hello everyone,  I have a question. Can I write a function that will be called automaticly every 2days in smart contract? kayabaNerve: got it ~ thank you so much. So contract must be called by someone , it will not be executed automaticly right? 
solution: 

issue: Nope. You can have anyone call it and timelock it to two days, and then set up a centralized server to do it, but the contract can't. Isan-Rivkin: Swarm City uses it Yes 
solution: 

issue: phalexo: I don't like bulk transfer functions; yes they're useful but they're not standard and they provide a security gap. Multiple contracts have been 'hacked' over a mass transfer func. 
solution: kayabaNerve: I don't remember proposing that they be implemented in an insecure way. The fault was with stupid programming errors (that is stupid, careless programmers) not the method in general.. 

issue: So I can use this loop? :P What do you need the whole contract code? xD the token is erc20 standard 
solution: That's not the issue. The issue is access levels. Who can call that? Is in the ERC20 or Crowdsale contract?. Solidity is the biggest language used to develop Ethereum smart contracts; Parity is an Ethereum node. You can deploy contracts with Parity, and test them, but I don't think it includes solc (the Solidity compiler)..

issue: Does anyone know by any chance how the logsBloom field in receipts is computed, I know it's a bloom filter but can't find how it is actually encoded :( oops sorry just realized it's in the yellow paper :) I'm not sure but maybe if you I'm not sure but maybe if you're using a delegatecall if contract A is calling contract B using delegatecall, then msg.sender will be A

issue: Can anyone help explain this seemingly bizarre transaction?(1) Account A initiates a transfer of 0.01 ETH to Account B.The transaction fee is set at 0.000105 ETH:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x496abba8deee9a2e0b9986d25135a44c1ad98029aa9d1e326d4e50718ef5bc1c(2) When the block is mined, the transaction fee that goes to the miner is 0.09220999999995 ETH (!) and the value of the transaction, amounting to 0.00779000000005 goes to a new account, Account C(!):https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3b0ba19ea6e3870d8993a9b76e9415ffa2e112ab07b6033de99ff7023fdb2b82The result is that transaction that Account A sent never makes it to account B. WTF?Can anyone explain what is going on?
