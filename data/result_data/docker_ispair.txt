issue: madkinder: - would creating a “master” Dockerfile and then having each project haveFROM mymasternot work ? regarding adding the “project” into the Image.. justADD . /some/path 
solution: the set of Dockerfiles reflects the building pipeline I use to build the distro specific packages (rpm and deb), I use Docker mainly as a sane clean environment + depenency cache. 

issue: two main complaints I got to the existing pipeline is that:it is not reproducible - jars/pythom wheels/php packages are fetched from an uncontrolled source; the environment setup is not documented and enforced;\nit is very slow due to redownloading all the deps each build 
solution: I also considered using LXC as an alternative, but it doesn't have good facilities for sharing the images like docker registry.

issue: Hello, i have a setup including jenkins and apache. basically jenkins makes a new build from git, then updates the data container volume which is also mounted to the apache host. but there are symlinks involved and before using docker i was using apache graceful restart. now that has to be triggered from the jenkins container, to the apache containers. so my question is how can i trigger an apache restart, or access the host’s docker binaries to restart the apache container.. thanks 
solution: it seems privileged is not the answer. i can use a shared data volume with incron to trigger any event on the server. but i m just looking for a more legal way..

solution: mickadoua: If you're a begginer, as me, I really recommend you to use a interface like Rancher to work with Docker. 

issue: Hey all. Wondering if I can get a couple of opinions: I have a container that, during build, effectively seeds the application (specifically, it's couchdb and I publish a couchapp into it). Because of how volumes work, I can use a named or anonymous volume and it's seeded, but if I use a bind mount, it won't be. So these are my options: 
solution: 1) move the publishing step into the cmd (prohibitively slow). 2) use a bind mount, backup the seeded data, restore it into the mounted folder. 3) use a named or anonymous volume. I've gone with 3 so far but I want to move the docker volume to another physical volume and setting a specific location for a named or anonymous volume seems like something that goes against named/anonymous. :). 

issue: ztratar: - not really looked into 'workers' but I would either have multiple Dockerfiles in the root and chose which one at build time (so you can have variations) - or I would use/make a build tool that would compile a Dockerfile for me using switches/json-conf? I might be way off but thought I would reply.

solution: 

issue: Hey there. Is this a known problem?  [<-CODE->] 
solution: dmitriz: it reads like one ;). 

issue: dmitriz: : the easiest option is to upgrade the server. But if you can’t, you can also downgrade the client. If you can’t do that either, then you could run an older client in a container (i.e.docker run -e DOCKER_HOST docker:1.8.3 ps) dmitriz: you could trydocker-machine lsto see if your Docker is visible that way; and thendocker-machine upgrade VM-NAME (if I remember well) 
solution: 

issue: dmitriz: what kind of docker daemon do you have? dmitriz: how did you get it? Is it local on linux? On a VM with docker-machine? On a cloud server you created? That someone else created? 
solution: 

issue: liphvf: it is equivalent to "docker run -a stdin”. ‘-a’ option will attach standard streams selectively. 
solution: 

issue: hey all i'm still pretty new to docker and trying to wrap my head around it one of the things that I still don't understand is a typical workflow for getting code into a docker container are people typically using git for this? editing within the container? editing from outside of the container? how does it work? huh then the idea is that you\'d be able to move your code into the "live" version of the container using mt but then how does editing go? that's the part i'm most curious about or do people tend to develop locally and then push to the container for testing and deployment? or does it really just depend? 
solution: 

issue: tstirrat15: I'm using local folders and mount them as volumes in containers, depends a lot of your needs. Sometimes you can add the code directly into your containers, or create small containers with code and mount them as volumes in other containers there are a lot of ways:in my setup I have local folders mounted as volumes and a webhook that pulls the code automatically, all the edits are made on my local machine.  You can also have a container (like a toolbox, with all the apps you need) and run it with attached volumes from another container, you can execute a container and install a editor, but this is a rare case tstirrat15: you can mount local folders and edit locally

solution: 

issue: hi guys. I have a question about Docker and couldn't find an answer:  in my repo, I just change a line of code, then build the image and tag it v1, then another line change, build tag v2. When I pull v1 and v2, its redownloading all layers, when just one line changed. It's like 600Mo download for one line change. Why is it not detecting that just the last layer changed on download this one? Like when you pull the :latest tag, its just downloading the outer layers change, why is it not doing the same thing for tagged images? What I am missing? 
solution: 

issue: How are you guys doing docker continuous deployment? So far I can check a dockerfile into source control and recompile it in teamcity and push to a docker registry, but now I want to use ansible to detect if the image in the registry is different to the running container and if so remove the running docker container and redeploy the updated container. I'm trying to find examples of an elegant way to do this. What methods are you guys using to do this, or what orchestration tools are you using in this space? 
solution: 

issue: raphi: did you change 1 line early in the Dockerfile?  If your change between v1 an v2 was at the very top they dont have anything in common anymore as I have understod it. Even if all but the top line are identical docker cannot know if the first line did change anything that would make something crash later on, so it cannot reuse things after the line change. it fixed itself?@nlhkh if it did its still interesting to know, that the migration takes some time or whatever trivia: you can use --link orion  when doing things like <name or id>:<alias > bad explanation, when name = alias you dont have to repeat them

issue: i am running a spring boot application into docker container using eureka netflix service discovery with@enablediscoveryclientannotation. Running my application, it registers itself into eureka with a specific ip address (that of the docker container). i want to change this ip to the host machine ip address, so that my application will be registered into eureka with the host ip address were my container is running. fast answer pleeeeease!!!!! 
solution: mootezbessifi: If there is no security concerns, you can run your docker container with host network stack. In other words, run your docker container with--net=hostswitch.. 

issue: Other option might be to run a reverse proxy on the host and route traffic through that so eureka picks up the host ip. I haven't tried this myself, but it looks it might achieve what you want [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: just looked at that again, I guess custom name is even worse :)Because Docker container names must be unique, you cannot scale a service beyond 1 container if you have specified a custom name. Attempting to do so results in an error.. Thought it would just append -1, -2 etc but seems not created an issue for the ability to override the prefix :) [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: for the last attempt, may I ask what happens when you run the container with--net hostand without--add-host …?

solution: 

issue: MakanTaghizadeh: i found suitable solution and more secure. i just added my hostname of the host machine to the dns server now when i mount the application inside the container i mention (in eureka config side ) the hostname of the host machine as well as switching "preferIpAddress" option to false now while a docker container is executed into a host machine  as a process witch can be accessed via his exposed port number the application will be registered in eureka with the host's hostname and its own port number and bingo it works like a sharm i found this solution the most safe and easy to implement after some documentations, the --net option is a real damage the container notion is broken added to security issues

issue: hantc: The GitLab docs are pretty good on how to run GitLab and GitLab-runner in containers. hantc: I upgraded an existing gitlab instance to a dockerized one by simply using-vvolume mount flags to map my host dirs to directories inside the container.

issue: I have a Dockerfile that I need to modify (slightly) when a) cross building and b) building on the actual device (i'm using an x86 machine to build for arm). The difference is a few ENV, COPY and RUN commands. Is there any way to make this conditional so that I can use the same Dockerfile on both machines, but behave in a different way? Sudo? What error? Hmm, maybe I could use an ENV parameter in the dockerfile, and use indeed the RUN of script.sh where I do or do not do certain stuff based on that ENV param. Worth a try

solution: Glad to help.  The real best answer is "just run it"....the tutorials around this things are utterly brilliant, incorporating github and dockerhub to spin up whole test worlds.. FYI: http://www.oreilly.com/webops-perf/free/files/docker-networking-and-service-delivery.pdf(looked interesting). 

issue: Anyone know of a good recent resource for a production ready Docker workflow?

My focus is on LEMP stacks. Been building on top of this: [<-LINK->] 
solution: it should be cross-platform workflow, so I use Vagrant with boot2docker - so I can develop from Windows.

issue: pozgo: hm i mean to view files on docker host that being opened by the container. Is it Like lsof -c docker? Currently i stress test my web service run as container but the performance looks poor, is it because the limited resource the could be used by container? 
solution: 

issue: abudargo: I might not be following. But you could attach to the container and do a lsof to see the open files. If you are running into resource limits you can start the container in privileged mode as well. If you trying to view a log file or trace file of the application I would expose the file to the host so you can debug outside of the container.

issue: Question: a docker container and its host share the kernel. So what if my host has a certain kernel version, and I want to run a socket image based on a newer kernel? How would that work? /s/socket/docker 
solution: 

issue: it\'s just about the concept, I\'m not sure I understand how you can run an ubuntu 16.04 in a container, running on an ubuntu 12.04 host for example. I would imagine that there are some kernel dependencies. I read about the fact that docker is just using the host kernel for system calls, and that "running ubuntu 16.04" is about providing files/binaries. I can imagine that some "new" binaries expect certain kernel versions, so i don\'t understand how that would work thanks, makes sense if I fiddle with modprobe inside a docker container, for example, blacklisting a certain module does it have any effect? since the host and container share the kernel, I'm not sure how kernel modules are affected 
solution: 

issue: lvegerano: use volume. acording to the entrypoint source you can use sh, sql or sql.gz files. so first create a folder and put your file in it then docker run -v $(pwd)/sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d ... should do the job lvegerano: the context must not be on line build. add a context: . line above dockerfile lvegerano:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: @lvegerano yeah, as David said, you need to define a volume in your build from where sh script will take a list of sql scripts. so you just need to check if that folder is exist. you can look at such script in official mysql buildit would be something like following [<-CODE->] insilde you entrypoint script. hm . there is official build of postgress [<-LINK->] and they use the same script:)

issue: Hey! So I’m trying to deploy a server. I built a WP site on my localhost and it works perfectly. I did a “-v” for a local directory. However, I wanted to build an img so I can download it onto the host server. So i created a new clean img and linked it to the old DB and then did a “docker cp” and put all the files into the container. I then did a “docker commit”, “docker push” & “pull”… I found on the host server that the files aren’t actually there…. However, the new img on my local host has the files and it’s not linked with “-v”… I’m a bit confused. Could someone help me out? 1595 people and no one is on? david-guenault: I copied the files into the container.. there was no mounted volumes and then i wanted to build an image so I can move everything to the host. I then created a new container and “docker cp” everything into the container. After that I did a “docker commit” I then do docker push to my repo… and on the host server docker pull 
solution: 

issue: unipheas: no sure to understand. if there was a volume on the commited container, data from volume will not be commited at all (same as using volume in a dockerfile) unipheas: but you said " I did a “-v” for a local directory."

solution: 

issue: unipheas: @david-guenaultdocker newbie and a lil new to the convo, but wouldn't a docker tag <image id> namespace/image then a push push his changes to docker hub? 
solution: yup but you need to commit first (you push images to the hub, not containers) ;-). unipheas: not resolving everything but when you did the cp there are some remaining files (install) in the new container, so it start again the installation. 

issue: So should I keep my current workaround and hope that the Docker devs get to a usable interface someday? [<-CODE->] I don't think it's guaranteed no you can change the IP on your host via configuration Also, if using something like docker-machine, you'd connect to the boot2docker VM and not the host 
solution: 

issue: anyone know if it's possible to ssh into a docker host from a container? 
solution: hmmm i thought that IP isn't guaranteed and it would change. in your host do ifconfig. 

issue: Working with Docker Compose (v2).  Given the two containers, gitlab and drone, how can i start gitlab to generate a value that is then exposed as an environment variable and then pass it into drone's container?  Must I create two docker-compose pods or can I achieve this in one? (oauth secrets) Seems almost like a good time to try Terraform (for this)

issue: I think I may have understood docker incorrectly. I did a yum install of docker on centos and I just pulled the docker registry image and started the docker registry for a localregistry (private registry). I dont have any docker login credentials. Can I use docker on premise without having a docker account? I was trying to build my dockerfile locally with an intention to push it into my private registry running on port 5000. But the build command did not succeed. 
solution: kkindaface: you don't need a docker account to build or run a private registry.

issue: wormen: you may need to ship the binaries and keep the source code out of it, but it all depends on the language you're coding in wormen: one way would be to mount the source code into the container using volumes, compile it and move the results into the Docker image's filesystem which will be captured in the image you're going to distribute wormen: or maybe you can use two different containers, one for building the code, and another for distributing to your users

issue: Hello another similar question: if i start a nginx container,  could i get a conflict with the classic installation of nginx with the port 80 or 443? 
solution: 

issue: soapoperator: in prod you'd probably let docker pick the port when you start the container and use a proxy (nginx or haproxy) to route traffic to the nginx containers. or maybe thisisyour proxy container? But yeah, you'll have to swap some ports around if you have nginx going on the docker host already. Or bind to another host ip, if multi homed.

Here\'s my command and the ensuing output: [<-CODE->] If this shouldn\'t work, what am I doing wrong? If it should work, is there some way I can get more information about what\'s going on, like a debug flag or something? Thanks for the help!(I\'m running this command on FreeBSD, whose docker support is allegedly "experimental". So that may be the problem. I just want to be sure I\'m not doing something wrong.) rkgade: ,@JnMik- To follow up, I figured out my problem. FreeBSD's docker doesn't currently support volume mounting. If you're interested: [<-LINK->] 
solution: It did start, for sure. I can fire up a shell in an interactive session even when I specify a--volumeoption. No error message or anything which is definitely not ideal..

solution: 

issue: if your Dockerfile usesFROM some_image, Docker will download the latest version ofsome_image, but if new versions ofsome_imageare released, your Docker image won't get these versions unless manually executingdocker pull some_image any solution for this? even though I use an specific version likeFROM some_image:3, if the maintainers push patches to the3tag, I won't get them yep, I've triedlatestbut all tags work the same way: if that tag already exists locally, Docker won't check for new updates for that tag when referring to it in a Dockerfile

issue: I am just starting on this, and might just have to clobber everything and start over, but I have begun (out of the blue, or so it seems) to see this failure when trying to cp a file out of a container:docker cp ContName:/tmp/proparse .Error response from daemon: lstat /data/docker/devicemapper/mnt/f026a95035ddda726d32c653f88fc69b6c1efe909859d375e03d96608297c61b/rootfs/tmp/proparse: not a directoryI did have to relocate the /var/lib/docker folder, using a symlink, but this was weeks ago and that change has been working fine.I can run the docker cp command to push files in....no error results, but no files are actually xferred.  TIA!! FWIW, that most-odd-thing above was never really understood.  I restarted all involved containers and the matter resolved itself. 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] However, if the db was not up, then its container starts, and my app tries to query it but fails (since it takes a few seconds before the db is responsive).what is the recommended way to overcome this problem?p.s the db is the official couchbase image, and the component on my app that queries the db is a third party plugin that i can't configure.

issue: Engineero: For your volume mount problem, as you see an empty directory that suggests that the source directory doesn't exist.  Seeing your path starts with /c/Users/path makes me think that you're on Windows, probably running Cygwin.   Try -v /cygdrive/c/Users/path/to/my/files:/notebooks/my_files/  ... I'd have suggested also c:/Users.... but I don't expect docker will like that extra colon .... Engineero: re-reading your earlier post, sounds like you're sharing the file system from Windows to your VM to Docker.  So make sure your VM sees that /c/Users/path already ...  How are you running your VM, VirtualBox?  Docker for Windows? Engineero: I guess your VM has a private ip on the same subnet as your WIndows PC, so form the VM you should (if not blocked by firewall) be able to connect to that <ip>:<mysqlport>.   Look at your VM ip address with /sbin/ip a, then look at your Windows ip form the command-line with ipconfig, you should have an address on that same private  subnet. Engineero: For your point 3. sounds good.  I wonder if you can't just append your changes to the tensorflow Dockerfile (thus building your own image still), or maybe you need those packages installed before the tensorflow installation?

issue: Hello everyone, I have some permissions troubles using docker-compose. I'm building a django app and in my docker-compose file I use volumes to share data between my host and my django container. As soon as docker creates the volume, the shared folder is owned by root, and my django app cannot write on it. I tried to chown the folder in my dockerfile but it does not work, sharing the folder restores the folder to root. Of course, it is not possible to use chown to fix that once the container has started. I found some SO questions about it, but none of them seem to clearly fix the problem (or sometimes by some tricks as changing the user-id from the host, but I would like to avoid that). Has anyone a suggestion to my problem? Thanks!

issue: Hi! Any suggestions on how host environment variables can be accessed from a container? I've managed to dockerise some of our apps, but we follow a practice of storing sensitive data such as API keys, DB connection creds, etc. in env variables on our servers. If there's no way to do the above, what're some secure practices for building images with such data in the image's env variables? When I say secure, I mean not specifying the sensitive data in the dockerfile/compose yml. ksylvan: Thanks a lot! Will need to play with it, but looks like this should do the trick! :)

issue: testlab9000: the move part is not detailed there but if I remember correctly, a couple of days ago  I gave you a scp command example that you could use to transfer the data You can also use rsync over SSH to make it incremental in case you want to repeat the transfer  [<-LINK->] That is just a way to move any data over between machines, there are lots of options and it has nothing to do with docker, you just happen to be transferring docker container dumps with the purpose of restoring them on the second machine, but it would work for any type of data you may have to transfer. I  guess that is why nobody else documented that step in detail

[<-CODE->] the file test.txt is created in the docker container and in the host, but my idea is this file created just inside the container.. Ok, I understand, how can I copy the path /home/guest/app with a Dockerfile ? because I need the files in the same root as the Dockerfile, and in this case I don't have it My Dockerfile is in, /home/guest/docker/Dockerfile and my files are in /home/guest/app I'm thinking to mount the volume, and then copy the files in different path inside the container.. but is very ugly 
solution: 

issue: the idea behind a volume is, that files from the host system are linked to the container. You need to create your file outside the linked path. can you go with thedocker cp …Here you can copy all files you need into your container. If you want to work on files inside the docker container, without using a volume, I think you need some 3rd party tooling. Some time a go I used a Samba server on the container to have access to the files inside. I’m not sure if that is the way you need to go today. 
solution:

I have a docker-compose.yml file to link up the external db volumes into the mongodb image. The problem is I can't think of any good way to transfer these db volumes from the localhost to the dev server and vice versa.

solution: 

issue: Have you exposed any ports? Actually nevermind, I’m not sure you need that But what you might need is to bind the java ip to the container

issue: I have a weird error where I cannot build containers, I am using windows, docker toolbox, virtualbox 5.1.2 if I run from creating a machine to setting up environment and trying to build a container I get: [<-CODE->] yes which contains  [<-CODE->] (I am very new so if I have made a mistake anywhere please point it out) np, I am not familiar with it either but google doesnt really help here :( do I need to do anything special to get docker engine running? or is that justdocker-machine? oh one mo, I need to do these commands inside the VM? I thought docker dealt with all that for me 
solution: 

issue: You could always do an docker exec -it container_name bash It would run in that container alone. Not spawn another run off command 
solution: 

issue: Is there a way to force the daemon to look for volumes under a certain path? ie when using-v /some/dir:/datafrom the client, it would actually mount the host's/srv/docker/some/dir? I know I could probably run Docker in a fs namespace but that's starting to get weird

issue: hi everyone. i'm using docker 1.12 swarm mode what's the difference between advertise-addr and listen-addr for docker swarm init? 
solution: 

issue: hello! I'm using docker-compose v1.8.0 and docker v1.12.0 on OS X and I'm facing an issue related to container network. If all services declared in a docker-compose.yml file are on the same network, should service containers be able to ping each other using the service name? Because I'm able to ping just from containers that declaratively links to another container, but not the reverse way. Example: container A is linked to container B, I can ping B from A, but not A from B. 
solution: 

issue: also when using docker-compose during your development processes do you automate it in any way via gulp scripts or anything or is it a manual step to run it? well gulp is not super important as long as there is some way to orchestrate the loading of stuff on command line simply like ideally the process would be:Devs clone repo with app and compose files for container dependencies\nSetup containers for app (mongo, redis etc)\nRun app locally but depend upon containers and currently we clone, npm install, gulp and job done so I was hoping I could do same thing, but have the gulp step provision the machine/containers etc so no extra work is needed

Logs: [<-LINK->] marcelmfs: I am doing it the same. Just mounting docker.sock but still docker-compose is not working The most weird that I can find nothing on net 
solution: 

issue: so, narrowing the scope of the problem, you're in a dockerized TC agent, running docker-compose from there, checking out a repository that contains a docker-compose.yml file, right? maybe if you explicitly passes the file path as argument to docker-compose?docker-compose -f $(pwd)/docker-compose.yml?

issue: hi) could you tell me how do you usually solve the permission question inside data container?i think an ordinary case is to get into container and run script for setting permissions.BUT what about set  sticky bit chmod g+s .in image and then after docker run (or docker-compose up my_container) attached files from data container will get right permissions. What do you think about this? Did someone try it? 
solution: 

issue: how can you run a docker container that starts a repl also how do you set the workdir in docker-compose 
solution: 

issue: marcelmfs: Hm, I think I got it working so far. Now all files in my php container belong to root though and php-fpm runs as www-data. Could you point in the right direction to solve those permission problem when a normal user wants write access on a data containers volume?

issue: marcelmfs: Yeah … and what about the deps of package X? The only solution would be to use another container with the same base image to download the deps, extract them and use them in the final container viaCOPY… but to be honest … that's no real solution. Docker should have some build time credential support in the end.

If you're simply closing the window without terminating the command, it's still running.

issue: docker psnever seems to work in OSX for 1.12.0-a, I have no idea what's going on. Diagnosis always says the same. Restart does nothing and only fix is to Restore Factory Defaults not using it too frequently, but it seems every time I come to use it, it's dead 
solution: think I've resorted to factory defaults at least 5 times now :) My guess is that a particular container causes the VM to eat up all resources and then it loses contact. Not sure if Docker protects against such a thing, despite containing. 

issue: Does docker compose allow for a way to define all my infrastructure in one file, and then plug into those containers from other, unrelated compose files? 
solution: which in turn defines the name of the network, iirc. Hmm, looks like I can define networks in the compose files too!. 

issue: is this merged into docker-compose? and if so, in what version?  [<-LINK->]

solution: 

issue: you're not rebuilding bydocker-compose up<- this only re-instantiate your already built container you have todocker buildto have your build process to pick the newer module after updating package.json. 
solution: 

issue: yeah,docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)anddocker rm -f $(docker ps -qa)is always handy (but you also might want a localhost:5000 registry to cache some images locally and save bandwidth. not if you don\'t expose the port withports: "27017:27017"in your docker-compose.yml

issue: Hello I was just reading about windows containers for docker in WIN 10 Anniversary Edition, and it sayd just have to install a diffrenet verison of docker. Is there a way to install both windows docker engine and linux docker engine. And manage them withn the same docker clinet? Thanks for your help@marcelmfs 
solution: I can't help with windows questions. 

issue: Can you spin up a windows container? 
solution: Docker has partnered with Microsoft for windows conatiner but they'll only work on windows. See here [<-LINK->]. 

issue: jaksky: - you're on windows 10?  Is your docker using Hyper-V?

solution: 

issue: I don't know how etcd works with virtualips, but in docker you just refer to your container by it's hostname or container_name or(!?) service name definitions. 
solution: and, according to [<-LINK->] , it seems there is a volume-driver plugin that also achieve the same results with more compatibility options.. 

issue: Hi folks I’m looking for an approach to mount a NFS or GlusterFS share in container And I cann’t find any acceptable solution Is there really no possiblity to mount a network file system in the container?

solution: 

issue: am i missing something? i really like the way docker-toolbox runs on the mac ... isolating machines ... different IPs, etc i understand the benefit, in a hosting environment, of using docker on a single box / ip is there an official way of still getting the docker-toolbox scenario (using different vms possibly) on a single box feels more natural for dev purposes ?? or, is it somehow just a matter of installing / using docker-machine ?? (on ubuntu, btw)

issue: Hi. Is it possible to publish a container's port  if the container was created via a docker service? i.e. I would like to use a docker service to scale and manage my service cluster, but I would like each container to still be directly externally accessible without use of the routing mesh.

issue: Hi! Is anyone using docker for mac? I have file sync problem. osxfs is too slow :( 
solution: 

issue: miha-: how do you see that the container is out of space? As far as I know, containers use the host's disk space (host = the computer that your Docker is running on). So if the container is out of space, that would mean your host is out of space.

issue: hello. on linux is there support for connecting to a webserver running on thelocalhost(not a container)from within a container? i tried binding ports but the ports are already in use by the webserver 
solution: if you are inside a container localhost will point to the container's loopback interface, so I do not make sense to me. You could use the host's IP. 

issue: you can always fetch the ip of the default gateway of the internal docker network (it will always point to an interface at your docker host) or, docker0

I have a directory on my machine and am trying to mount it to the relevant directory inside the docker container using: docker run -v local/path/here:container/path/here container_image But unfortunately this Isn't working. I suspect this is because the Docker dir I'm attempting to mount is symbolically linked to two other directories inside the container - does this mean my local dir should also be linked to those directories? V3ckt0r: it seems to be equivilent according to the docker documentation: Note: You can also use the VOLUME instruction in a Dockerfile to add one or more new volumes to any container created from that image. V3ckt0r: and then you use 'docker build ... '?

issue: Run during build process can execute single commands and not start daemons like service. If you want a Container to run PHP-fpm at runtime, you have to use CMD PHP-fpm. 
solution: toughIQ_twitter: CMD ["php-fpm"]also tried. Says that php-fpm is not found in PATH. 

issue: MaximZavitaev: if I run your build instructions, I get an gpg key error and the build fails. I assume you need this special build? because it would be way easier to go with the default php:fpm image from dockerhub. [<-LINK->] colshacol: it depends on the project. ;-) but yeah, sure you could use a docker container. depends on the app. if its an interpreted language, like php, you could do it on the fly, by just mounting your local working directory into the  container. if its something which has to be compiled in some way, you would have to rebuild the container to reflect changes. but since building is done via aDockerfile, you just have to write all the steps down one time and all setup steps will be done properly at build time. /var/lib/docker/image/*but its not really a human readable format ;-)

solution: 

issue: You cannot scale with ports specified. Need something like a loadbalancer or docker swarm. Yes. This works. But exposed ports forbid it. You can't bind more than one process to a port on the host. And since compose alone does not provide a loadbalancer or routing mesh, scaling will fail.

issue: fjcero: afaik this is not supported. the idea of docker is, that a Dockerfile or build process should work anywhere, so relying on some local environment is against this idea.Why do you want/need to mount a volume during build time? this does not make sense, since this volume wont be available at the time and place a container is run from this image. ely029: There are some basic videos by Docker in this playlist: [<-LINK->]

I guess not, cause multi service architectures would be a bit tricky to manage

issue: If I've got a docker container running docker (teamcity agent running builds) what is the best way to mount a volume in the 'parent' container into the 'child' container? The 'parent' container has the host docker socket bound (-v /var/run/docker.sock:) so when the agent (parent container) tries to run a new container and pass some -v flags; the -v flags don't get mounted correctly as far as I can tell presumably because it's not actually a child; but a sibling; and the directory trying to be mounted doesn't actually exist outside the 'parent' 
solution: 

issue: Trezamere: I haven\'t actually messed with volumes in that manner, but have you tried using "volumes_from" by creating a sibling of the parent container that maps in the volumes from the host you want to use and then having the spun up agents using  volumes_from? hmmm, you could probably mount the socket, though you might need to run the container with--privilegedto do so, any particular reason?

solution: 

issue: galvesribeiro: in my experience that should be all you need to do. Are you certain the application is running on port 5000 inside the container?

issue: I am trying to run as a different user in entrypoint (docker alpine), but I am getting:su: must be suid to work properly. Any help please?`  [<-CODE->] that is my entrypoint to run start.sh as user dev. My solution for now is to specifyUSER devbefore ENTRYPOINT. I don't think so usingUSER devis helping me for now. 
solution: 

issue: Does the Alpine container come with sudo? 
solution: 

issue: if you want to leverage caching of build tasks, yes, that's the best solution. But to release a container for production, I usually remove build tools and ship the container with the minimum to run the service. 
solution: 

issue: one workflow I\'ve seen is having a "build" container that assembles all your dependencies and your package, and then outputting that to a local volume share, then having a second container that only has the application dependencies (not the build ones) and copying the build container\'s output into the runtime containerThis is quite same process .Net Core team is using... One container with the SDK and the other only with the runtime 
solution: 

issue: hey guys curiousity... if I spin up 2 containers no docker-compose or link enabled and I need to make them talk... is that possible? I mean, I spin up a SQL Server in one container, exposed the port 1433 and from another container I'm trying to connect to it will it work? hum? sorry I'm not following... DOCKER_HOST is a env variable for docker engine, right? 
solution: 

issue: you can open ports on host machine, and use DOCKER_HOST host for connection

issue: Hi guys, I want to access to one of my container from another device connect to the same netowk So I want to know how could I expose my nginx container to the network ? I'm using docker compose, so I can launch multiple services, and I need to share a specific service (nginx) It's not my question, I try to access from my smartphone that is connect on the same network, and I can't I launch my container on my mac and after try to access with my smartphone to the nginx container but doesn't work. I solved my problem by adding a new rul in my nginx conf, the problem doesn't come from my docker conf but my nginx conf. 
solution: 

issue: fr4ngus: when you start services ( that is what is called a unit in docker-compose ) you can access every other service of this "docker-compose.yml" file by using the service name ping <servicename> will work, but also telnet <servicename> 80 for your nginx-container you do not need to expose any ports in the internal network of services in a docker-compose network 
solution: 

issue: are there any strategies to speed up docker COPY commands. I have to copy several cache directories from host into my image so that my asset compilation and app build is fast. But these directories are full of files. Is it faster to tar them first, transfer the tar and untar it (or use ADD) even ENV commands take several seconds to complete perhaps I'll load host volumes instead of copying ah i see I'd have to mount it, run my commands then commit the container to a new image

solution: 

issue: can you pull and run just the container that you are trying to inherit from? msitruk: 
solution: 

issue: can you find another Dockerfile that uses it to see if it is just this particular file? I'm not sure I've seen two WORKDIRs defined in a single file before 
solution: that sounds like a failure of node inside the container, you might ask in the nodejs/node channel about that. 

issue: Hi, I am noticing that the container files don’t update after the host files change in a mounted volume.

solution: 

issue: hi@renegoretzkayou might need to ping the Rancher channel as I'm not that familiar with how that platform interacts with containers and forwarding at first blush I\'d check and make sure the containers are on the same network "segment" and then that you exposed the appropriate ports from the wordpress container

issue: Hello,I got Caddyserver running. The Database is working correctly now and moved the domain to point to my new server. Somehow I get just a clear Website, even when I curl the webseite I get zero response.I have made a look into the Caddyserver logs and WordPress logs and I get the request, but no response. I also installed nginx as a container and served the nginx to Caddy to see if Caddy is proxying correctly. I get the welcome screen from nginx. So this is working fine, but when I again bind the WordPress container to Caddy its just nothing.Do you have a clue what can be the reason to get no response on the client but requests on the server?Thank you!

solution: 

issue: I'm new to docker and have been working at getting react-starter-kit up and running for dev and prod using docker-compose. I keep running into issues no matter how I seem to go about it.  Using straight docker I get it running but I can't seem to browse to the server thats running in the container. When I use docker-compose I get an error likesh: babel-node: not foundwhich I think might be happening because for some reason the container is not in the right directory Anyone that might be able to lend a hand would be very appreciated 
solution: 

issue: Easier question.... for those looking to use docker for dev workflows that use hot reloading/auto reloading.... is there a best practise for node_modules folder? I mean the node_modules folder needs to be compiled on the container but conversely I need to setup a volume for the src so hot reloading works. Seems odd tonpm iinto a tmp folder in the dockerfile and then get docker-compose to copy that over into the host machine volume. Not to mention that folder being leftover after compose is shut down.

solution: 

issue: are you running this in house or on a cloud hosting solution? reading the Orleans whitepaper they recommend using Zookeeper if in house, or Azure Tables/SQL if elsewhere agreed, but Zookeeper/Consul/etc will all solve this for your containers, so what is preventing you from using those or Azure Tables as your MemberShipPool? or registry or whatever 
solution: I'd just give it a try using Azure Tables or whatever, then if it does not work, you have exhausted the possibility, if you haven't tried it and are just assuming it won't work, then it is hard to suggest alternatives. 

issue: From inside a container can I access the host ip machine (on docker virtual network) so I can make requests to dockerd REST api? dragon788: /@killerspaz? 
solution: or you could mount the docker socket into a specific container and present the REST api on the docker network, though security wise that is frowned upon. I cant use the socket hack because it is linux specific.

solution: 

issue: I think, I have something important to say.It's the second time that this happens with me. I install docker on Linux Mint and after some hours the disk is full. Dont know why this happens, but I found out one thing, that also happens these two times. I lost all my system backups (I use timeshift). I dont know if it's some kind of conflit, but I think I have to report this, because it's a shame. The last time I had to reinstall my system, because I couldnt even start the system. This time, when I realise I had just 6GB left, I deleted some stuff here to have at least 20GB free, then disconnect from internet, restart, delete all docker images (Yes, I installed yesterday and I downloaded 4 images) then uninstall docker, and the magic happens. 100GB free right now ... Someone tells me. How this is even possibel that docker uses 100GB ? I was watching the free space decreasing. C'mon. Fix that. Until there, I will be using docker on a virtual machine, because I cant trust this software anymore.

solution: @quaddo:matrix.orgassumingtelnetis installed on the VM, can you connect usingtelnet localhost 2376?. 

issue: so the runtime image uses a package that you are compiling in the devel image or it requires an environment similar to the devel image minus a few devel packages? the container ID is a random GUID, you can pass the--name somenameto adocker runcommand to give it a name you can reference, but it needs to be unique galvesribeiro: ^^ 
solution: @quaddo:matrix.orgwhy would you need to change that?.

solution: 

issue: I assume the docker host has a volume to which I have to write the outcomes of a python script inside a docker container. This host volume has to be mounted on the docker container which runs the python script. But how can I get this path of this mounted host volume and put it as a ENV in the docker container? (so that the python script knows where to write its data to)

issue: Is there anyway to force docker to store credentials in plaintext in the config file?  It is keeps using wincred and I don't want to use that... I've logged out and logged back in to no avail. I definitely remember my local machine storing them in the config file, but for some reason it now is only using wincred.   Any ideas? 
solution: killerspaz: It only gives a single example of setting it to Mac OSX's credential manager.. 

issue: Hi, am trying to debug a container that blows up starting my app and am down to looking at linux startup files that process various config files.

solution: 

issue: iDVB: may check hackmd, we build an awesome docker container there 
solution: 

issue: need some health monitoring internal and external to the container; something internal to keep checking the status of what you need running/accessible, and something external to poll it once in a while to know to kill/restart it.... there's unfortunately so many ways to accomplish this, it just depends on what level of effort you want to put into it. you could simplyexecaps | grep APPto see if it's running external from container on the host 
solution: 

issue: i think he's saying they check the container's health status based on the result of that HEALTHCHECK entry as likely listed bydocker inspect, and have an option to auto-kill the container should it be unhealthy

I've pretty well got dev docker workflow working. I'm starting to loose hope for that to translate into a prod docker stack docker-compose.ymlseems like a great implementation/standard file.... why did we feel the need to createdocker-cloud.yml? 
solution: 

issue: I think it's the mere fact it's integrated now? I am not really sure 
solution: Yeah i think that's what he was referring to, before hand you used a swarm image to do the management for you. 

issue: Swarm is integrated now. (named swarm mode) But there is still the classic swarm tool kit  [<-LINK->] vs. [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: @SISheogorathThe only nodes who have access to the controler API of docker swarm mode are the managersSo that means I cant have a docker cli connecting to it from outside it? The container will behave just as any docker client I just need them to have connectivity to the master nodes Thats all

issue: SISheogorath: saying i'd read the blog post exploring this discussion.. Something succinct with a focus. There's a ton of information here that could be explored in detail 
solution: Azure is very appealing, MS is very prominent in Austin and pushes it very hard. 

issue: oh yes! but we have to mention that in general nodejs already includes a cluster framework :D so not sure how useful it is :D But I'll give it a try 
solution: so each node.exe process is 1 single thread. 

issue: how to define links in docker-compose file if i want to deploy on the warm swarm 
solution: you should not use links in this case. Address the services and may add network aliases. 

issue: Afternoon! SISheogorath: the swarm init never worked :( nop... got one email from Victor Coisne saying in other words, wait :( 
solution: 

issue: jjohnson1994: it depends on your "secretness". If it\'s a deployment key and it\'s not a problem if everyone has it. Include it. If it is a problem, you can thing aboutmount the key to container\nadd it as environment variables\nwait vor 1.13 and add it as secret

solution: 

issue: hello there! hello there! I have a question on the fly! is anybody here?! if run docker-compose up.. should I see the running containers of docker-compose on docker ps?! 
solution: supposedly yes.. but it doesn't. 

issue: SISheogorath: interesting! Does that mean docker would fail to mount, or just fail to write? I would have imagined it failed at write-time, since the mount is legal but the write isn’t 
solution: To make containers more secure theUSERTag is used more often in Dockerfiles. This way you drop root permissions which results in a problem if you mount directories from your real host. Because you have an uid mismatch. 

issue: hello! do any body knows why command property in the docker-compose.yml file prevents docker to make the container up! [<-CODE->] I mean you won't find it on docker ps I just need to run bash script just after the container is up.. without override the default command I still don't get why it prevents container to be up! I can't see it in docker ps I don't get that why i feel like it's complicated.. I'm doing volume .:/app and once it's up I need to run specific bash script from that dir 
solution: 

issue: Mmmmm I\'m not sure I agree with the "not how docker was meant to be".... I WANT it to lose my env vars every time I restart my terminal, so I\'m not working on the wrong machine the whole concept of docker in general is transient/ephemeral run-time.... to me this is right inline with that mentality. 
solution: 

issue: docker-compose down && docker-compose build && docker-compose up, i used to be able to pair these and it would only rebuild images when things needed to be. my containers are now being rebuilt from scratch every time. any reason one could think?  [<-CODE->] used to be, that if i hadnt changed requirements.txt, it would reuse that cache. i have not changed requirements.txt and for some reason its bailing and not using the cache its rebuilding containers that i have definitely not changed. for example, im changing stuff in a django container, but theres a node container i never touch, and its going through all the npm install bs that usually only happens when the package.json is different (invalidates the build)  [<-CODE->] usr/src is being mounted as a volume could it be a log file or something being written from inside that docker?

It says refer to the docs but I can't find docs for 1.10.Can anyone point me in the right direction?I want to use depends_on but wait for the service that I depend on to report as healthly before starting the next service. I've tried just adding a healthcheck to the dockerfile of the first image, and can verify it is working independently, however, depends_on does not wait for the healthcheck to be valid 
solution: 

issue: git bash works nice and since I have vim on windows I can actually edit files :D 
solution: 

issue: with PowerShell for Linux you could probably add the Windows Filesystem as another "PSProvider" for cross system access 
solution: yeah, I think they are also working on the stdin/stdout in conjunction with the OpenSSH native binary for Windows. yeah, the native one that the OpenSSH for Windows team is working on is apparently hoping to go back upstream as well. 

issue: Did anyone have any issues running centos in docker? especially when restart services I keep on getting an error. 
solution: 

issue: sabrehagen:  [<-LINK->] sounds not really nice :D first idea -> reboot what exactly are you talking about? 
solution: if you are trying to run a complex multi-service application you need to use something liketinito manage the initialization, because "init" isn\'t running in most containers. 

issue: sudo service docker statusdocker dead but subsys locked So this is a thing… any ideas? Yea… I just made a new instance, reconfigured my load balancers, and cloudfront instead I think it’s for automating things ;o 
solution: 

issue: were you using systemd in your Ubuntu image as well or was it using Upstart or something else? 
solution: 

issue: Is it true to say that theswarmimage on docker hub ( [<-LINK->] ) is the old docker swarm, and not 'swarm mode'? 
solution: I keep gettingError response from daemon: Timeout was reached before node was joined. The attempt to join the swarm will continue in the background. Use the "docker info" command to see the current swarm status of your node.when I try and join nodes to my swarm. What could be making them take so long to join?. 

issue: Do you have all the required ports open and accessible between your nodes? I have multiple swarms running. Once I got all the ports and stuff set up, they connected without problems. See [<-LINK->] for the list of ports. Note that 4789 and 7946 are both tcp and udp. 
solution: 

issue: Hey I have a bunch of different Docker containers running a bunch of different web apps How do I create a container on 80 that will forward any incoming requests to the corresponding container, based on the Domain in the URL I am trying to configure Traefik, but its been acting annoying - am I going about htis the right way? Nginx config also drove me crazy when I tried it 
solution: 

issue: I trieddocker run --name mongo -d mongo -p 27017:27017to start a mongo container with port 20017 exposed to host however its not shown started whendocker ps 
solution: 

issue: Can a Docker on a host call another docker container on the same host? (if they are on the same network due to docker-compose) 
solution: 

issue: kinghuang: Ive set everything up to come to the conclusion that you need docker in docker to run adocker runcommand of course.Ive looked around and it seems that this kind of behaviour is discouraged. Is there any workaround to execute adocker runcommand without installing docker in docker? You can do it with the-vflag it seems. How would this translate into docker-compose? 
solution: 

issue: hi, I have been trying to figure out an issue for a few days. my containers is running a service on port 8080 this ports is exposed a68c91a7977b        d7d996294eb6        "/usr/bin/run_authori"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8545->8545/tcp, 8180/tcp, 0.0.0.0:30302->30300/tcp   lonely_cori but I can't connect to these ports on my host any idea ? when I login to the container, I can confirm that the services are running on the ports but not accessble from the host 
solution: 

issue: milanvdmria: don't use privileged, you'll have to mount the docker socket from the host into the container, don't do docker in docker, it's best to do docker outside docker as in [<-LINK->] ;) 
solution: 

issue: hello is anybody using docker to package parity ? looks like I can't access the any of the parity ports from the host when connected to the vm, i can see all is working ok 
solution: 

issue: Has anyone here been able to use hardware acceleration (DRI) in a headless Xvfb container to run protractor tests on WebGL enabled pages? I've tried to share the/tmp/.X11-unixsocket,/dev/drmdevices, and enablexhost +forwarding but still getting timeout when trying to target a page with canvas with protractor... 
solution: haven't attempted DRI yet, but will need to soon, I'd be interested to see your findings. 

issue: I see. Any way to reproduce the error if it\'s not a "personal setup problem" :D As we should file a bug report in case there are conflicts that are based on common setups galvesribeiro: related to [<-ISSUE->] there should be a swagger specs somewhere Not sure where ^^ but somewhere it should exist 
solution: 

issue: Hey, I'm a bit rusty with docker,  I have an instance of cassandra that is in a docker, assuming it's running on port 9042 can I connect from my pc onto it ? [<-CODE->] 0.0.0.0:9042->9042/tcp 
solution: You should be able to. 

issue: cedvdb: docker exec -ti <image_id> bash for connect into shell cedvdb: if you wanna check if 9042 is listening on your host, try telnet onto it or just use netstat -tulpn and see if your computer is listening on that port 
solution: 

issue: Using docker registry:2, TLS enabled, I can't seem to get a CURL request to the v2 api to delete images... Server keeps saying not a TLS handshake, but I'm using--cacertwith my curl command... Any ideas? omfg, i figured it out... i was hitting http, but it requires https... DUHHHH 
solution: 

issue: milanvdmria: you want to do a "docker-compose scale" if you want to run more containers iirc 
solution: 

issue: I want a docker container to build my assets, then I want nginx to server them in another container. Should I use volumes for that? Should I serve the generated assets from a volume? 
solution: 

issue: If it's a simple build process it's easier to extend the nginx container and build your assets during a docker build process. Reason: it's a lot easier to scale. But if you really want to build it in separated containers, yes, volumes are the way to go. neiled: see above nischay30: Hostmapping? Can you explain what exactly you mean? brunocfnba: In most cases this error appears when your entrypoint script orCMDis not intended the right place, Missing +x or has another error like missing Linux file endings if you build the container on Windows. You can may explain or link how you created the image 
solution: 

issue: Hey, I need to run a simple docker compose file with 2 services. I\'m using the entrypoint command in compose and getting this error when I run itinvalid header field value "oci runtime error: container_linux.go:247: starting container process caused \\"exec: \\Anyone faced this already?

issue: Hey guys, I am trying to use secret in docker beta 1.13.0-rc7 to share my local ssh-key to my dev container, however I have a few questions about it... as it is something RC, I've not found too much support for that yet.... Do you have any advice or another way to do it? pls... 
solution: 

issue: I wrote this the other day, it is long and filled with code, but may give you some ideas. [<-LINK->] it is my first attempt at doing any monitoring/logging management - feedback/corrections are welcome of course 
solution: 

issue: Has anyone solved the issue with a host with multiple network interfaces being able to route traffic to the docker container? e.g I have eth0 and eth1 serving external traffic that needs to be routed to my container. 
solution: 

issue: hi all ! anyone has managed to get containers with maven isntalled ... withouth needing to install maven everytime a container starts ? SISheogorath: do you mean : mvn install ? or the package of maven while I build the docker? 
solution: 

issue: originalsosa: As containers are kind of abtraction on userspace level (mostly) and routing is something you do in kernel space it's not the best idea to do it in container. Sure you can do it with docker but it possibly breaks the isolation. I would recommend you the usage of a VM in this case. it's better for isolated kernel operations. If you only need to route traffic directly to your container thant you should use another network driver like macvlan or ipvlan nischay30: did you create an overlay network for you application and joined your services in? if not you should do that ;) argeas: How about installing maven while your docker build process? argeas: What every you want to install :D nischay30: services like? [<-LINK->] ? buts101: context? erichermansson: What kind of network bridge do you mean? Docker uses a Linux network bridge by default. (in case you are on Linux) galvesribeiro: Lol I can't paste into the gitter.im app x.x I'll send it to you in slack 
solution: I prefer IRC but not for docker. As it is located on Freenode and my backlog on Freenode has thousands and thousands of messages :/ I try to avoid opening it. 

issue: anyone ever used Kafka in docker? ouch there is no official container :( 
solution: 

issue: Anyone know how to get bridged networking in docker? SISheogorath: the bridge im talking about is the kind of bridge I use on my KVM. Like the instans can be accessible via my router 
solution: 

issue: What do you think is best, a generic volume called mysql (as an example) of 10gb where all the databases live, or a volume per database? problem with a volume per database is that I'd might end up with a lot of volumes Fair point Thank you 
solution: 

issue: SISheogorath: thank you for the answer. i change right of my file and it seems to work now (?). If i want to enable mod_rewrite, the better practice if to run the commandea2enmod rewriteat start or to modify the container with terminal? 
solution: 

issue: Hi there. I have a question about docker compose. I want to assign a new memory limit to a container but on restart it does not propogate from my adjusted compose file to the container. Is there a way to force that without throwing away the container?

solution: 

issue: i try to run a simple container with docker-compose withphp:7.1-apache.Unfortunatly when i connect tohttp://0.0.0.0:10003/, i get a 403 error. I notice my volume are/usr/local/apache2/htdocs:rw. Is there a way to solve this right issue? SISheogorath: thank you for the answer.  It was a misconfiguration with the volumes. 
solution: 

issue: Is there a client for docker registry  http api v2 ? 
solution: I guess the first one is better because I saw more recent commits :D. 

issue: hi, is there have diff between docker-compose[entrypoint, command] , dockerfile [ENTRYPOINT, CMD] ? 
solution: 

issue: does anyone now the default location of where maven depndencies get install in container ? 
solution: 

issue: Howdy - if the trailing values on a run command are the following, how do i convert them to docker compose:    syslog+tls://logs.papertrailapp.com:55555 from [<-LINK->] is that a logging option? i dont understand the syntax 
solution: 

issue: Hi everyone! Does anyone have experience with the nginx-proxy image by jwilder? [<-CODE->] Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated! SISheogorath: Thanks! Rewrite got left in by accident. Just can't seem to get location to do anything :/ 
solution: 

issue: 4406arthur: actually yes. I met that issue without compose but the service was starting and worked so I ignored it :X SeanSassenrath: rewrite and proxy pass in the same statement? Sounds like your server answers before it passes the request? (guess) I really prefer Traefik as reverse proxy these days 
solution: 

issue: killerspaz:  [<-LINK->] <----aux-address? It's mainly to exclude addresses iirc but maybe it works with external hosts too :X doesn't really looks like :/ Another reason for not using docker compose :X wait there it is: [<-LINK->] I write systemd files :D with a start command with many many arguments ^^ 
solution: 

issue: I'm even not sure what you need this for :X there is dns outside ^^ 
solution:

solution: 

issue: Hi, I just installed docker toolbox for windows and on running it I got error -  [<-LINK->] Any idea how to fix it? Thanks 1.12.6 
solution: 

issue: You mean a central place like for the creation of networks? No. But you can use ENV files and include them killerspaz: default values are something I assign in the entrypoint script of the container, not the compose file. 
solution: 

issue: so i've been fighting this issue where my scripts with +x on them are -x in the container.... compose not telling me why, etc... finally build manually with docker engine, and of course it tells me:SECURITY WARNING: You are building a Docker image from Windows against a non-Windows Docker host. All files and directories added to build context will have '-rwxr-xr-x' permissions. It is recommended to double check and reset permissions for sensitive files and directories. buuuuuuut... those aren't the permissions on the file 
solution: 

issue: I've got to sleep. bye all. 
solution: 

issue: playground: I would still prefer the [<-LINK->] killerspaz: you are on windows and have unix file permissions? Hopefully you do not use bash for windows to build docker... as far as I know that ends in something broken :X 
solution: 

issue: hello, i run a container with php/apache + mariadb + phpmyadmin with docker-compose in a custom network. I would to run  another container... Is it possible to get phpmadmin works with all network together to get one url? Is sharing container recommand by the guidelines of docker? 
solution: 

issue: The recommendation by best practice says 1 process per container. Now you can think about is phpmyadmin an own process? not really but it's an own application so it's maybe better to  split it into another container because in case you have to scale there is no need in scalaing phpmyadmin. And maybe the scaling of phpmyadmin ends up in race conditions you don't want to have. So my personal answer is: split it out. and to bring them together on the same subdomain use a reverse proxy. My recommendation for this is: traefik.io but you can also add a simply reverse proxy rule to your apache config soapoperator: looks like your phpmyadmin is not configured to use the network maybe it needs tty? 
solution: 

issue: @SISheogorath Thank you for your answer.I am trying to split it out. In my container php + mariadb (container 1), i pass environment variable MYSQL_USER and MYSQL_PASSWORD. In my phpmyadmin container (container 2), i pass environment variables MYSQL_USERNAME=root, MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD and PMA_HOSTS (i try : the ip address of the container 1 and the network name). Unfortunatly i get an error when i try to login: [<-CODE->] Do i have to add php to the container 2? Could it explain the issue? 
solution: 

issue: I feel you're kinda missing the point of containers and how they work; might want to research docker a bit more... Try starting here: [<-LINK->] soapoperator: ^^ 
solution: 

issue: Anyone have any ideas why my rsyslogd dies withRUN rsyslogdin my dockerfile? but if I exec into it, I can start it fine (after killing the pid file erroneously left around) tty for what? it's the host and even when disabling the tcp stuff it still crashes  [<-LINK->] my dockerfile.... it seems to run, but no output in docker logs, so i can't even think of where to start debugging CMD is set through docker-compose, that's working fine (runs a node app) bah, figured it out.... I forgotRUNstatements execute during build, not runtime :/ can't believe i was hung up on that! 
solution: 

issue: @killerspaz Thank you for the advice  I read a lot of thing without practicing. It'svery new for me. Finaly i progress faster when i face to the problem. The problem was with a volume for config.inc.ini.@SISheogorath Finaly i succeed to make phpmyadmin communicate with the container help with: [<-CODE->] But when i add another external, it doesn't work. I will try to inverse: add the phpmyadmin network to my mysql container... 
solution: 

issue: As far as I understand this responsibility is of the App which is using Cassandra. I am also having a technology stack where my App is using Cassandra, it looks for keyspace and tables and if it's not there, it creates it. 
solution: 

issue: in general you shouldn't be able to build any image in docker-compose v3 anyways reason: v3 is for distributed deployment and builds are only available locally 
solution: ic. so lets keep 2 docker files instead. but in all cases, build should be available so people can develop using it. 

issue: why are you do this? do [<-CODE->] wc -l-> count lines 
solution: I mean, it call the API twice to check for dangling. it works I just tested, it just not optimal when you have tons of images dungling arount :). 

issue: hey allo ! anyone know how to target a specific device when running container  ?  from here it says : [<-LINK->] docker run -d --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb -e "DEVICE_SERIAL=yyyy" what is the device serial? the actual android device serial ? or the usb serial ? 
solution: 

issue: Hi I have searched over the stackoverflow and some other sources, but not get the correct answer My question is "How to use Django container connect to host postgres?" I had configure the host-postgres to accept all the connection and let container connect to host-postgres by this line [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: DJQTDJ: I guess you picked the wrong channel. That's an HTTP CORS violation. Check for CORS in you favorite search engine. aniket-21: Alpine has no bash installed. You can maybe add it byapk add --no-cache bashbut in general that sounds bad. Write  the script to work with/bin/sh 
solution: 

issue: argeas: hi all . i have 2 android devices..  I start the container like this  docker run -d --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb --name auto1 appium/appium-project-base:latesti can see both devices..but second container cant either device 
solution: 

issue: killerspaz: npm link/yarn linkis a very typical module dev workflow. It allows you to develop a specific module while in the context of a larger app without having to add/commit/push/yarn upgrade each time you make a single line change to the component. for us... it might be a docker-for-dev show stopper if there isnt a work around. I just tried making the changes to the dockerfile and gotERROR: Service 'web' failed to build: Forbidden path outside the build context: ../react-player () 
solution: killerspaz: I sense an abstract debate.... but is it not fair to say that people use docker as their dev workflow? so rather then deving on the host... you instead dev in docker? This is what we've been doing for a few months now... successfully too, this has been the first road block.. 

issue: You mac guys... :D Running Docker in linux is so simple, works out of the box and has no problems with anything :D 
solution: 

issue: I have a really stupid docker question. I had to reinstall docker on my mac, and now my ubuntu images don’t persist any of the apt-get updates I run in the container. Did something change? How do I get back “persistent” containers? 
solution: 

issue: hi guys, I’ve been using docker-compose to build my local stack [<-CODE->] The issue is that my apache server can’t connect to my redis server when It tries to connect through  localhost:6379 Is there something that I’m missing I’ve checked my /etc/hosts and the only reference is the web server ips and container id I’m using docker 1.13 What is strange is that I can connect to my database through localhost:3306 SISheogorath: thanks, you were right I needed to use redis on apache, you made my day :) 
solution: 

issue: hello, i use docker-compose to run some container (wordpress for exemple), do you have a clever solution to deal with the permission issue: volumes use ww-data:www-data.I try to adduser :"1000:1000"but it get a connexion error.The only solution i find is to add my usr to www-data group thenchmodthe folder. But it\'s not very elegant and a n arg in docker-compose could be more consistent. 
solution: But i try to install directly in another container apache + mariadb + php but i get an 500 error during the install... And i suspect the container user don't have right to copy and edit wp-config file.. 

issue: Does docker-compose up also build the image? or i explicitly need to build and then run up also is run only used to start a single docker container? 
solution: 

issue: @aniket-21 docker-compose up will build the image if it doesn't exist already.after that it will run without rebuild the image unless run with --build optiondocker-compose run is used to execute a one-time command in one of the services  configured in the docker-compose file 
solution: 

issue: Hi I am new to docker. When I do docker run hello-world in windows 7 where does the image files get copied to? I downloaded docker toolbox and running it from the docker terminal 
solution: 

issue: Why ship the output around? Simply build it and keep it in your image. Install all build dependencies, build your app and delete the dependencies and unnecessary packages/libraries/etc. But if you really want use a buildhook for it and do crazy things leon: But I also know some people who try to avoid a rebuild in the docker image so they simply install their build artifacts to the container and start them 
solution: 

issue: Hi Guys, I'm super frustrated with a really basic networking issue and am wondering if anyone could shed some light on this. It's really pretty simple: I have a little webserver (karma) that runs on port 9876, and it spawns another process (phantomjs) which connects to port 9876 and runs the tests. None of this is to be exposed or externally mapped. All I need is karma binding to 0.0.0.0:9876 and phantomjs to connect to <whateverinterface>:9876. The problem is that this doesn't seem to work at all in Docker 1.12 or 1.13 on Linux or OSX. Any ideas? Same container. You can test this with any container which has any port. just run your container and then exec -t -i <container> sh 
solution: 

issue: I have a deployed a springboot app and mysql db on docker swarm. The app unable to connect to the mysql on port 3306. It works perfect in docker single host using "docker run" command but not on docker swarm mode. any help? I dont see any errors in the docker logs. 
solution: 

issue: I am facing this issue of file name too long with sbt build [<-LINK->] and setting max file name size to 72 doesn't help issue happens cos docker storage is encrypted anyway to have unencrypted storage on docker? I didnt get any solution around this 
solution: 

issue: hi all:I am trying to start a container and have it see a specific device(phone) is it possible instead of : docker run -d  -t -i --device=/dev/bus/usb/001/066 .   to use the device serial number? at the docker run command ? dragon788: thought the same.. thanks ! 
solution: 

issue: it probably can't see the device's serial number with that USB access, what you'd need to do is a pre-script that queries the serial number on the host side and resolves it to the correct USB bus and passes that into the run command 
solution: 

issue: is there any downtime to currently running services when running astack updateto  add a new service to the stack? 
solution: so you'd guess that only changes would be implemented, current services would be untouched.  just wasn't sure if it essentially stops the current stack and starts everything all at once with the new stack config or just looks for changes in the config and implements those. 

issue: ely029: could you be more specific ? you can mount a set of sql files in a given location and those would be executed when you start the container official documentation provides that 
solution: Awww I will set it up in volume in yaml file. 

issue: Hi all,I wonder that  the lantency  in swarm replicated services model ,if  I set redis replica = 3,  the state of them always keep same ? you are right, but I didn’t setup redis cluster config, swarm mode also sync it

issue: does any one know why the time is out of sync for docker native on osx  [<-ISSUE->] I am unable to pull my own public image it downloads some layers, and thn fails with unauthorized error 
solution: 

issue: Does bigger docker images take more RAM ? for exaple mysql in debian jessie vs mysql on alpine ? killerspaz: -- i am on osx, i did not create any docker-machine when i do date command on osx, i see ist time when i do docker info command, it shows me UTC time nope, now its a native application, and dont need docker-machine 
solution: 

issue: killerspaz: Docker still uses a VM but it doesn't rely on any non-native libraries to do it. It uses some kind of Virtualisation layer based in MacOS kernel. LuisUrrutia: you're welcome Depends on your docker-compose file

issue: guys in the production server? what do you prefer in booting a docker container? create a .sh file or start it from running docker-compose up in the terminal? 
solution: I have problem in docker. It seems the php and apache is started up but When I was refreshing the php file its looks like a text file. 

issue: Can you share your problem here maybe someone will help you and also, you should ssh into the container to see error log does the Apache not run or your web app failed? hum, weird

issue: Hummmm I'm not an expert but, old VMWare apps uses VTx for virtualization, and Docker needs new Hyper-V virtualization 
solution: If you disable Hyper-V to run VMWare with VTx, it seems that Docker will not run.

issue: Hi everyone, I am new to Docker, I have just successfuly deployed a new Rails app to Docker Cloud. But It looks like everything (all services describled in docker-compose) is packed as a single image running on Docker Cloud. So that on the production, I cannot check to see the status ofpostgres,redis,sidekiq, etc. Everything work well on development mode by following command:docker-compose up, but production. Any ideas? 
solution: 

issue: can anyone point me in the right direction to get docker networking set-up to run home-assistant run inside docker and still be able to scan all the devices on the pysical lan?

issue: weickmanna: depends on the number of gap versions weickmanna: most important is kernel's hosts versions weickmanna: I use my Docker 1.13 for building images and run it on Docker 1.10 in production 
solution: 

issue: kbluescode: wtf... i\'ve tried on OSX, Linux, AND windows, literally a simple node scriptconsole.log("STDOUT information here"); console.error("STDERR info here");and all i ever see when i rundocker-compose upisSTDERR info here.. i have to usedocker-compose logs <service>to see STD out info i mean i made these docker images, and i know it's not the container 
solution: 

issue: killerspaz: what version of docker-compose? also it might just be the container itself, honestly 
solution: 

issue: with a windows container in docker is there a cap on the amount of memory it can use? i have ms build integrated into a container and it keeps reporting its out of heap space 
solution: saw a cpu and memory slider when working in linux but nothing in the ui when i switched to windows. 

issue: Speaking of... does anyone have any sources for discussion around the future of docker on windows? I keep hearing that docker-toolbox isn't going to be supported in the near future, and want to know what that means for us that can't run hyper-v i use docker-toolbox which utilizes the virtualbox driver... the main instructions discuss hyper-v installation as the only alternative for windows, which runs native windows vm's. So i'm pretty sure either way, it's virtual machines. In my linux environments, the docker daemon runs natively in linux, and doesn't require any docker machines

solution: 

issue: RobertBroersma: how did you share the volume? I'm actually not sure why you share the code by volume >.> 
solution: 

issue: ideally you would do the copies in your Dockerfile, you would simply volume mount your code directly where you need it in the container then any changes you require will sync both ways if you need a one way sync where it mounts the code but can't change it, you can change the volume mount options for that 
solution: 

issue: I just read that I shouldn't ask my questions here. Should I go somewhere else?@SISheogorath Like I said I'm new to docker. I'm not sure why either. I just searched how to share my code with another container.@dragon788 I'm not sure what you mean. How is it different to volume mount in Dockerfile than in compose file? Basically what I have on my client container is a dist folder that I want to share with my nginx container 
solution:

solution: 

issue: If you really run docker in docker you need it. In you case you want to use the CLI. Not sure why it breaks. Can you runlddfor the docker command? To make sure nothing is missing Oh and try to run your container with-u root 
solution: i saw group_add, which i added a user/group in the host, and added that user to docker group as well, so i'm expecting it to have elevated permissions.

After some reading, i am trying to add it like that: [<-CODE->] Unfortunatly i get a 502 error.Who can i add multi commande line correctly? Maybe i have to add this line to the server :nginx:latest Without this, the container works well. 
solution: soapoperator: - i think you need to add  this inside Dockerfile. 

issue: xav19: does the docker CLI use HTTP or does it use a direct socket connection? 
solution: 

issue: oh now i (xav19) see the crap dragon788: i guess it uses the socket, boondock uses it on any unix system, and it works it certainly mimics how the cli works but that's just guesses 
solution: 

issue: damn, ok so via cli i can access, but jenkins still can't :/Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock can get it working with sudo added to the container image, but i really don't want that Finally got it all working, just took some stupid guid swap: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: @killerspaz i try this way with for example: [<-CODE->] But the container is running well but i get an 502 error when i try to access to php files. right, i didn't give all the config: [<-CODE->]

solution: 

issue: Hello, I am new to docker and docker registry. I have one particular question regarding tagging images. Does thelatestwork in a similar fashion as SNAPSHOT in maven (latest points to the latest image in the repository)? SISheogorath: So what is common workflow used when you want to have versioned history of builds but having your compose everytime pull the latest for development purposes?? SISheogorath: Don't they override each other that the only last one is valid? That was my impression. Are you aware of any documentation where I could find that?

solution: 

issue: Why is there a bunch of whitespace between host and container definition? In general there are no quotes need but the scheme is HOST:CONTAINER 
solution:

solution: 

issue: hi all,  in docker(1.13) swarm mode,I am going to build jmeter distributing load testing in docker swarm.Is it possible communicate between container crossing node use container’s ip,I am using default overlay network and ingress network, created by docker stack deploy. gadget_mnky_twitter: in my point of view, I thought cross node communicate depends on build-in LoadBalancing ? Thats why I wonder is there a probability use container’s ip 
solution: 

issue: Whats the docker-compose equivalent to CMD from the dockerfile? What is setup in CMD is executed like its typed into the command line, right? Is it executed form the workpath, or the root of the container? 
solution: So in general if there is a entrypoint scriptCMDprovides it's parameter. In case of no entrypoint script it is placed after default shell. In general that should be/bin/sh -c.

solution: 

issue: Anyone knows a good solution to use php-cli and keep the container running it alive? I’m trying to run a micro service (Lumen) by only using php-cli. But the problem is that my container exits by itself Probably because php-cli is not running a daemon 
solution: 

issue: tulpn: I could explain the whole thing but it would take me long time as I am on a smartphone. I recommend you to read the user guide in the docs [<-LINK->] comeUpWithItLater: you can run the reverse proxy on your host but I would recommend you to run it in a container too. Make a lot things easier. The mentioned images are both for containers 
solution: 

issue: Can anybody come up with an explanation as to why docker is not creating iptable FORWARD rules?  I've just got a default DENY rule and containers can't be accessed, if I do iptables -P FORWARD accept then the containers can be accessed. Normally docker creates FORWARD rules but since reinstallation it's not doing that.  It's creating other rules, just nothing in FORWARD. 
solution: 

issue: Is there a room to ask questions about accessing docker go client or docker libcompose? I'm having issues with it authenticating against my registry 
solution: 

issue: Pretty straight forward I'm just trying to get the go libcompose to recognize my private registry: [<-CODE->] but I can see it parsing the auth configs when I added log dumps to the libcompose. There is probably some simple call I am missing? when I use just docker-compose it works fine 
solution: I traced it... The project calls pull for each service and each service calls pull for each image.... 

issue: has anyone had success with dockerized jenkins running docker within? I've volume moutned docker, and from within the container i am able to fully do anything i want with docker, but jenkins is complaining access denied (i'm testing with jenkins user of course).... this was working earlier today just fine, i just restarted all the services due to a non-related service change. now all of a sudden it's access denied non-stop from the jenkins ui (again, inside the container works fine)

SISheogorath: thanks for the reply, yes mount my x session sounds good I didn't know you could do that . Dumb question I assume this is done inside docker container right? SISheogorath: thanks !! 
solution: 

issue: Hi I have a bit of an awkward issue regarding container to container connectivity whatever I export or publish, I only getConnection refusedwith curl full details here: [<-LINK->] it would be awsome if someone could have a look on that 
solution: 

issue: I got huge question here fellas, so i posted here [<-LINK->] to not flood the channel 
solution: 

issue: vyscond: I would recommend you to ask this question in [<-LINK->] because it's a setup which possibly needs addition information etc. jeserkin: in genereal I would recommend [<-LINK->] But in genereal Docker for Windows and docker for Mac create a VM for running linux containers. But they run all docker commands inside this VM. So the docker image itself is not a VM template. Docker itself uses linux kernel internals to isolate containers. For Windows containers the same applies to windows. In this case docker doesn't run a VM. But I can't say much about windows containers. As it's nothing I use. 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys! How to install docker on ubuntu? 
solution: 

issue: Hopefully a quick question, I have a service like so: [<-CODE->] And another like so: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] ryanturner: what exact command are you running to try hello-world? Problem with dial: dial tcp: lookup mysql on 127.0.0.11:53: no such host. Sleeping 5sis what I keep getting, as if it has no clue where to hit a DNS? hmm... I'm t hinkinghostnamedoesn't actually have an effect on the DNS config, i think it jsut sets the hostname of the container in /etc/hostname 
solution: 

issue: well downloading an image gets you the base, and then you create a Dockerfile that can run additional steps to build a "container", containers != VMs, a VM can emulate other hardware to run the OS, Docker containers require the host OS to have a similar kernel (ie Linux containers on Linux, Windows containers on Windows) though sometimes you can work around this running a container within a VM, but that\'s not a common requirement

issue: Mornin' Guys, how can I enable network connection to the internet from docker container So for example my project in container requires files to be downloaded through curl But I'm getting [<-CODE->] ping command is sadly missing as well Sry guys. Seems VPN network somehow conflicted with that. Once it was off, everything was fine. 
solution: 

issue: It did help a bit. My main question would be, what is considered to be an image? e.g. I've created aDockerfileon my system. Can I specify to run it somehow as an image? e.g.docker run /path/to/local/Dockerfile 
solution: 

issue: jeserkin: : docker build -t image-name:[tagoptional] -f PATH/Dockerfile or just exclude  -f PATH/Dockerfile and do "docker build -t image-name ." to build an image.   I think the . should work to show the build context anyway :P then type "docker images" to see your "image-name" in the list and you can run a container from that image with "docker run -p host-port:container-port image-name" Syntax should more or less be right - I mostly use docker-compose nowadays but you can type docker <CMD> --help to get more help on a command. 
solution: 

issue: Docker parts translated to classic schemas:Dockerfile - Source CodeDocker image - Programm (compiled binary)container - ProcessIt's not completely correct but to understand how it works, that's maybe helpful 
solution: To have a tagged image you need to add the-tflag to yourdocker buildcommand. 

issue: Hi, Can I ask a question about docker-compose? I`m writing docker compose file and how can I make a service as the effect of "docker run -t" to prevent the container exit ? 
solution: 

issue: @SISheogorathhey.  When I writeFROMinDockerfiledoes it mean mean, that I'm referencing only image orDockerfilefrom what image was built? Does it matter whereEXPOSEis located inDockerfile? I am marking, thatEXPOSE 80 443, but in resulting container there are no ports provided out of the box. Only if I add myself. So few questions left from my interaction with Docker. [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: Anyone run into an issue with a node project wheredocker-composesetup is yielding errors about a node module not found, yet you can run the container manually and it works?  [<-CODE->] vs [<-CODE->] should be pretty straightforward not sure how that would solve any problems related to this? it's 100% listed just above... dockerize is the only thing i have added besides node no entrypoint set 
solution: 

issue: I'm not completely sure but I would say there is a difference between the run statement and the settings you pass by compose killerspaz: do you run an entrypoint script or similar? 
solution: 

issue: killerspaz: I’ve had this issue with docker-compose in general before with npm modules. switching to yarn w/ a yarn.lock file solved them for me but I’m not sure what the real issue here is and whether it’s with npm or docker-compose

issue: hi guys running docker toolbox for Windows on MinGW64. I am running a container which has localhost port 8000 exposed.  Because of this vm machine set-up for Windows Home. is there a way to find out which ip it is exposed now on this container?  I have had success with server all containers with ip 192.168.99.100  [<-LINK->] EXPOSE 22 8545 8000  is in my dockerfile i am getting portainer to show up on [<-LINK->] when i do      docker run -p 8000:8000 -it embark-container  [<-LINK->] maybe there is another way to get access to the index.html file.COPY embark_demo/ /usr/src/embark_demodocker run -v " xxxxxx " -it embark-container how do i run the container so the embark_demo folder is exposed in my laptop.Also would this work when my container is running the app.  Will I be able to open the index.html this way?  [<-LINK->] nice managed to lick up the volumes. are the changes made to the container folder show up in the host folder in real time and vice-versa? looks like the container is properly networked  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: and for sure it's running on 8000 inside the container? sorry, maybe i misunderstand your point. As per your question earlier, you should be using whatever daemon you're attached to viadocker-machine Niko-La: look up volumes 
solution: 

issue: lanyangyangIs there anyone uses a GUI manager for docker in Linux ? 
solution: 

issue: langangyang: portainer is a nice GUI manager. Works on all platforms, for everything else I have to say no. I prefer the CLI anyways Maybe take a look at rancher but notice that it's not pure docker anymore 
solution: 

issue: I have been trying and found that you cant change the port forwarding /volume mounting etc once the container after it is created is there a way we can achieve this? 
solution: 

issue: In genereal: If you have a problem with restarting/recreating your containers the image or container is broken. Containers are there to be rebuild.In your special case: You can, but not without a very hacky solution. The hacky solution is using iptables to rewrite your ports

It works. Next step add basic authentification. 
solution: 

issue: Niko-La: Because they have different tags, but are actually the same image.

issue: I have installed Docker for windows. Do you have a good guide for how to bridge the windows host and linux host so they are linked and they can resolve from eachother? 
solution: 

issue: SISheogorath: Thank you for your answer. It put me on the right way. I finaly notice,  either we use command and flags or we use traefix.toml. But both don't work together... finaly incomand, it doesn't find the flagweb.auth.basic.users. So the solution .toml could be more robust.

solution: 

issue: soapoperator: I used a simple container in front of it. If you use Traefik you can simply use it to do this.  Otherwise there is the possibility to use one of those nginx images which are laying around on docker hub and provide basic auth soapoperator: maybe check [<-LINK->] bitsofinfo: possibly you should try to use go templates. Not sure if it's possible for environment variables. I should read the sources related to this later. If you can edit the container maybe simply use the hostname 
solution: 

issue: vforsythe: but how do images get into it, is it built in another container on that system or just pushed by a dev? I ask, because there may be layers in your daemon that could be pruned as well. I typically clear up anywhere between 30-100GB/day on our build system

solution: I think that you can tag it to another image. 

issue: yes.@papaiatis, you should be using docker commit Example is:docker commit -m"updated perl modules" 2327e636355c sopanshewale/gdrive_php here - "2327e636355c" is actually your running docker container instance\'s id "sopanshewale/gdrive_php is my container tag/name .

solution: 

issue: Guys, is there a way to map exposed volume without loosing it content inside container? I see, that it is possible to add mappings relative to current directory with docker-compose, but I can find how areRUNcommands handled in docker-compose in comparison to Dockerfile. 
solution: 

issue: There are noRUNcommand in compose. Compose is used to orchestrate local docker containers while the Dockerfile is there to build images And when you mount a named volume to your directory the structure stays. If you mount a directory from your host it's always empty or contains the things you place into the location on your host. So you maybe run your container one and copy everything out or change the image to bootstrap the filestructure into you volume if it doesn't exist.

issue: Hi guys. How can I use Docker with Angular CLI? I want to be able to build my app and push it to a production docker container that is serving nginx as well. So the problem is, I want to build a dist folder in the docker container, and during development I would be able to watch the folder and serve the webapp Anyone could provide some guidance on how I could do this? carljmosca: Thanks for that, didn’t know I can read other’s dockerfile. But anyway, what’s the point of building images? Isn’t everything run via docker-compose? Why would I build an image? Yes! Haha I don’t quite understand the docs, despite reading them countless times. I could just do a docker-compose up and it all runs nicely And there’s no image that is built 
solution: 

issue: MaxGoh: I am not sure I can sufficiently answer that in a few short lines.  Containerization has many benefits…portability, lower overhead, simplfied maintenance, etc.  Ultimately, your image can be deployed (as a container) to  production…is that not your goal? 
solution: 

issue: hi, I have a program written and tested on mac, and now I want to make it easy to distribute -- can docker help in this case? 
solution: a mix of python and c++. 

issue: So "docker for mac" will allow you to run a linux specific docker image. So if you can convert your code to a linux specific image, then docker will help you Unfortunately, no. I had high hopes when the BSD added the linux support, that MAYBE someday Mac OSX would too. But it looks unlikely. 
solution: 

issue: hi, is there a way to block a specific container from sending smtp? 
solution: 

issue: dragon788: thanks for the feedback - the problem is that these containers are being managed by AWS ECS - they get launched dynamically on demand and they might get moved around… I need some way of defining on the container itself that it should block outbound port 25… it looks like —cap-add with the right options might have given me the ability to turn on IP tables within the container… but that’s not supported by AWS ECS for some insane reason 
solution: 

issue: YuvarajMe: that's something you have to define in your deployment process.Depending on what your setup looks like you may want to use TravisCI, circleCI Docker hub, Docker Cloud, ... In combination with Ansible, SaltStack, Puppet, Chef or a Shell script with SSH, ...

I try to add letsencrypt for my nginx-proxy which installed globally.I found goo sample for docker compose https://github.com/fatk/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion-examples/blob/master/docker-compose/v2/simple-site/docker-compose.ymlBut I can't understand some things.... SISheogorath: I reconfigure now globally nginx proxy container and now that's work.... Oh shi~. But how off ssl encrypt 4 some containers? 
solution: 

issue: Wow that's super complicated .-. you use one container to generate nginx configs, one to serve TLS and jwilder's to reverse proxy everything. I would suggest you to use Traefik it's a hundred times simpler .-.  [<-LINK->] see theproxyservice... That's all you need 
solution: 

issue: jbelmont: in general you have to use the docker internal networking. Thumb-rules: [<-CODE->] Also remember that the docs for your couchdb image says it is created in [<-LINK->] . So you have to create the database with our application or by hand if you expose the port (wich you don't do) jbelmont: you actually don't need theEXPOSEstatement EXPOSE is mainly used when you do things likedocker run -Pwhich I never did because why should I want to provide a random port?

Im starting up my server using/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f /docker-compose/docker-compose.yml up -d although the bridge is setup independent of that 
solution: looks fine, I would say yourDNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAINis from somewhere else. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] I have read tons of manuals and still can't grasp how to run services in a running container automatically. Now I have to attach to each and run it manually. Hi, first of all. SISheogorath: thank you for your reply, I read them again, but still didn't find an answer to my question. 
solution: 

issue: you could try going into your container and working with mongo directly from there? ie. typedocker psto see a list of all your containers, find the CONTAINER ID for your mongo container, then executedocker exec -i -t <CONTAINER ID> /bin/bashreplacing<CONTAINER ID>with the actual container id (a hash likecdd536e1fb5f). realisation: Yeh@realisationeven if it container has an entry point you can still do this  to get shell access to your running container and poke around and what not 
solution: 

issue: Whatever yourCMDis gets runs when a docker image is run. Many base images set this to bash so you can poke around in the images by default. When an entrypoint is set, this gets run instead. Depending on the "form" used in the dockerfile, eitherSHELL ENTRYPOINTis execute when a container starts, orSHELL ENTRYPOINT CMDis executed. When you usedocker execnone of that matters, and it just executes whatever command you tell it to in a running container. 
solution: 

issue: alexeydemin: you can't start MySQL using the service file. A docker container is not a VM and only stays alive as long as the first process of the container doesn't exit. If you start MySQL using the service file, it forks into background which exits the initial process and end up in a dead container. Check the official [<-LINK->] or [<-LINK->] image on docker hub if you want to know how to run MySQL inside a docker container 
solution: alexeydemin: you should avoiddocker commit(as a low level docker command) in general because it prevents you  from providing reproduceable images.

solution: 

issue: buyology: you can usedocker ps -fto filter your container to get the right id. If you use docker compose you can also dodocker-compose exec composename binaryor if you need an interactive shelldocker exec -it $(docker-compose ps -q composename) binary. There are many ways to achieve your target. Stay creative :) And in general using container names is a good advice ^^

issue: hi guys - anyone know how to configure logging with docker-swarmkit and supervisord running in containers ? confused on whether to share the /var/log directory or redirect to stderr, etc . what are you guys doing ? SISheogorath: thanks for this - my host is running journald. is there a way to ensure that docker logs go to journald and are tagged with name, container-id, etc ? @ SISheogorath: wow this was a big EFFORT. how to properly tag docker logs with swarm names and container labels and then making that available to query from journalctl. it is not documented anywhere - had to pull from bugs filed in other places.

issue: hello everyone... just getting familiar with docker and started playing around. I followed [<-LINK->] and im stuck on "docker-machine ip MACHINE_VM". It returns: Host does not exist: "MACHINE_VM". The wordpress setup is available under 0.0.0.0:8000 though. SISheogorath: i am completely new to docker and follwed the getting started and [<-LINK->] docker-machine is installed but it seems like the problem is i run docker for mac and i read something like docker-machine isnt available this way seems like i have to install docker for mac and docker toolbox as well to have docker-machine working on a mac ... 
solution:

solution: newrelic, if you are happy paying money for it. 

issue: Datadogs does a great job for monitoring docker. They have a free plan for 5 or 10 hosts (Without alerts). For a on prem solutions I would suggest Prometheus wcgcoder: possibly related to: [<-ISSUE->] In general I can say I noticed a similar behavior related tonet.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 fixed it with a few scripts and a systemd.timer :D 
solution: 

issue: is there a good solution to managing volume permissions on a host mounted filesystem yet?  I think the two best options are to have an entrypoint script to gosu as the user or to pass the /etc/passwd and /etc/group as ro and pass the --user UID:GID; both have drawbacks something like a volume plugin? 
solution: 

issue: In my docker-compose.yml I runcommand: bash -c "npm install && tail -f /dev/null". I need to do tail -f to keep the container up and running. Is there some other, cleaner way? I tried couple of things like tty: true and stdin_open: true but container always stops unless I pass tail -f to the command. SISheogorath: got it, thanks 
solution: 

issue: how can i add my host machine volume to a running container? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: timilsinabishal: the current "mostly used" way is to simply access it like your host is a remote computer. (means use it\'s public hostname) and then go the regular way. If you try to connect some kind of loopback TCP port: No, not possible as long as you don\'t use--net hostornetwork_mode: host. Problem with those modes is they break the network isolation of your container and also possibly cause trouble related to IPv6 since there was a bug in libnetwork

solution: 

issue: damilare: Check out [<-LINK->] damilare: Your question needs a little clarification. Are you trying to use python to access the docker container or are you running python in your docker container and trying to simply execute pdb? The latter would be something like:  [<-CODE->] 4406arthur: I haven't tried it but I would remove with yum and then try to yum install the specific version like so:  [<-CODE->] This assumes you have the following: [<-CODE->] lukewatts: If the volume is mounted to a host dir then yes. eg [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: Hi all, I'm on my 3rd day of learning Docker. Going well. I'm just wondering about volumes. When something is changes or generated inside a running container is that reflected on the host? Or is just from host to container changes are reflected? chadlyon: @SISheogorathPerfect! Thanks 
solution: 

issue: chadlyon: so the picture is there is a process running in a container already, a web app process. if I put a pdb statement in a line, and I hit the URL, I want to be able to drop into a shell to introspect the data 
solution: 

issue: damilare: without more specifics I still can't really get an idea of exactly what you are trying to do but play around with my second comment to you above. That will get you a debug shell inside your docker container. That will give you a good start. Alternatively, running a regular interactive shell like bash in your container would be:  [<-CODE->] lukewatts: Perhaps your nginx config is not pointed at the correct dir in your container. You should see changes in the container reflected on your host path. As a test you can do: [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: SISheogorath: ,@chadlyon, thank for replying, but something I notice need to do,  remove /var/lib/docker will occur cannot-remove-device-or-resource-busy, explanation in  here [<-LINK->] ,I think reboot is more convienent..to much process I need kill..and also need uninstall a dependency lib - docker-engine-selinux, for solving conflic problem SISheogorath: , I am little confuse.. Monitoring or orchestration? 
solution: 

issue: SISheogorath: Sorry this is a late response. But in reference to my node_modules volume on my host machine being empty, I set it up like this:  [<-LINK->] So now it creates the node_modules directory on my house, but it's empty. I am using yarn to do my installs, not sure if that matters. 
solution: 

issue: FuzzOli87: you create a separate, unnamed volume for your node_modules. It's normal that this wouldn't be visible to your host.  The content of node_modules is a mountpoint in you container so you can't see it outside 
solution: 

issue: how do i get on the docker slack chat? 
solution: In general I read something about a mailingliste that is possibly found for moby which then would be the place for development :D.

solution: ripper2hl: depending on what you need help with, you'll may get some :D. 

issue: KramKroc: docker compose always prefixes a project name. By default it's the name of the folder you started docker-compose in. if you want to use the volume you created in a separated step, useexternal: truein your compose file. [<-LINK->] KramKroc:  [<-LINK->] ?

Do I need to setup the mapping to my own filesystem via cmd or the dockerfile? 2. If I used the pull method, where does the dockerfile get stored?I'm using this image https://hub.docker.com/r/fauria/lamp/Thanks for your time :) thebuccaneersden: Thank you I saw those lines in the docs, but I was concerned since they were already mapped SISheogorath: Thanks man, I see what you are saying about the single responsibility issues of that image. I will go through that guide as well, thanks, have done tutorials in the past but I was just unsure about this one aspect where I had no dockerfile to play around with. thebuccaneersden: Thanks man, will check it out checkout https://training.play-with-docker.com if you want to have some very detailed guides Just thought I'd let you know that the SSL certificate is currently not working, so just got a bit of a scare on the https link 
solution: 

issue: thebuccaneersden: how can i use "--net host" in docker-compose.yml v3 ?..I am using docker stack deploy command to up the service. 
solution: 

issue: @Asiddiki the only way to set the networkmode to host is this setting: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#networkmodeBut as the documentation says: It's ignored during stack deploy. You can't use networkmode host in swarm

solution: 

issue: Hi! Is it access to connect a container network created by docker compose via it's network name and host name? I can access the container by getting it's ip fromdocker network inspectbut not via it's hostname Well, a network connection ;) For example I can access elasticsearch's http api (which is one of the containers specified in compose file) by writinghttp://<ip_from_inspect>:9200. Why can't I access it by it's service name likehttp://elasticsearch:9200or maybe something likehttp://projectname_default.elasticsearch_1:9200 
solution: 

issue: Hey Guys can you please tell me how to configure docker registry on https with certificate directory not with certificate name ? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, in our team We have some difficulties with mapping host user <-> container user (host user does not own it's files after running container). Could You please point to some nice article or documentation? It seems to me, there is no such mapping in docker, which seems a bit weird to me 
solution: 

issue: Hi. The volumes are mounted only from the host to the container? That is, changes in the container are synchronized to the host, and changes in the host into the container will not fall? Or I something not so do? @dragon788 i write [<-CODE->] in docker-composechange a file on the host, but the container changes do not fall Everything is fine The problem lies elsewhere. Server on NodeJS should watch for the file to load a file and reload the browser page when changing. Changes appear, but it does not reload the file and page browser pjetr: i use webpack and hot reload. pjetr: with nodemon it will be long enough to build the project 
solution: 

issue: wouldn't it be loads easier to this using CI? 
solution: 

issue: To deploy your stuff use docker-compose with overwrites. See the docker-compose in production page in the docs about how to do it. This was you can simply define the environment you want to go to. And in your CI description add a simply if clause about what branch your are running to decide the Target for deployment scippio stop the docker service and remove/var/lib/dockerif you have nothing important like volumes on your system Alternative is to unassign the IP from your interface and remove the container then beniamin-kis: removing the docker-compose.yml shouldn't stop or affect any created service

solution: 

issue: chrisaj: in General Docker shouldn't effect the network performance a lot as it doesn't do very special things with the host's network. But I can't explain it completely. In case you want some very experienced and detailed answers the best was to go is asking in the [<-LINK->] or the [<-LINK->] . nuomi: portainer and rancher have something like an "AppStore" but tbh I\'m not a fan of it and I don\'t think they are build to be used by endusers. And for sure not auto-scaling. Maybe dokku is something you like to checkout too scippio: the only way to do that is breaking the network isolation of your container and run it with--network host any reason why you need it? oh I see you have mutliple interfaces not really perfect ._. an alternative would be to redirect traffic that has dport 25 vito-c: you should checkout the most recent changes in [<-LINK->] it's possible that it is the case. Can't say much about it but sounds like the plan they had when they splitted out the moby repository scippio: on what OS are you? 
solution: 

issue: Would anyone know why a docker container wouldn’t copy all the files from it’s directory to a mounted volume on the host OS Just one of them I used the following run commanddocker run -it --name AureliaBoilerPlate -v $(pwd):/var/www/src -p 9000:9000 -p 3001:3001 webgnostics/aurelia to mount the volume and only one of the files contained in it appeared on the host although when i nap shot it and browed all files where present in the src folder of the container 
solution: 

issue: zsjohny: like makeing sure a tag is not replaced? As far as I know that's not possible right now. But you can use the image ID to make sure you don't get the wrong image moringaman: iirc this is not possible because docker uses bind mounts where no creation step happens. That's why it doesn't copy files to your filesystem. If you want to have the files usedocker cpto get them out of your image or named volumes. 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I have faced strange (for me) result of the command 'docker service update --rollback servicename'.

solution: 

issue: can we install a complete OS in container? or are containers just for applications, like DB, etc.. ? I am still new to this 
solution: brittanyrutherford: you can, but defeats the point a bit.... but I see some containers for ubuntu. yeah, they're a little misleading, more of a very minimal distro (minus system kernel etc) to run your apps or services. 

issue: @brittanyrutherford just to make sure you don\'t get container wrong: the base images like "ubuntu", "debian", "fedora" or "alpine" have one reason: Tooling. [<-CODE->] To run Linux containers on windows you can use Docker4Windows. In it\'s default setup it creates a VM in background which runs linux and executes the containers for you. You shouldn\'t notice it. On docs.docker.com you should find a few easy tutorials. But if you want an more interactive way to learn how to use container even if you have no idea about Linux, maybe http://training.play-with-docker.com is the place you want to visit. The tutorials are very detailed and should help you to get started very easy and fast moringaman: you can run them directly ->docker exec CONTAINERID /path/to/command arg1 arg2or you have to setup something likesupervisordinside your container which manage these things but I don't recommend it MajorasJack: have you tried to access your application when it "hangs"? Becausedocker-compose updoesn\'t detach the log so the command "doesn\'t end" by design (if you want to detach it usedocker-compose up -d). Sry if you know that and you\'re sure it\'s a but, just ask to make sure you don\'t miss anything NikIvan: You use the docker toolbox, don't you? Does [<-LINK->] help? looks fine, can't say for sure, as I don't use windows or virtual box the easiest way to see if it works or not is testing it 
solution: 

issue: why do I need to use container to push my changes to container registry, then to AWS/Azure? I am not seeing the value of docker if it can't replace virtual machines :(

issue: brittanyrutherford: Thanks, what’s the problem with supervisord? 
solution: 

issue: Hi folks. I’m doing some investigation into docker 1.13 & swarm. We use Spring Boot Microservices with Eureka for service discovery of the services. I’m having problems with getting our services to see each other. Some of the services start on the ingress network, and others on the network I created for the stack. It’s pretty confusing and I’m not entirely sure if it’s an issue that I’ve created in docker stack setup or how I define my service definition in Eureka. I’ve created a much smaller microservice system that reproduces the steps I followed and I wondered if someone could take a look to see if I’m missing something from my network definition or service definition in the compose file: [<-LINK->]

But when I do awgetfrom container A, it only works for the ip address on the container network.

issue: gdeverlant: If you’re trying to acces the database server that runs on hostmachine, it would be better to run your database in the container and use docker-compose to set up network easily 
solution: 

issue: nischay30: write a Dockerfile that is based on the cassandra container andCOPYthe config into the container fthamura: check minfs, iirc there are people using it. I don't know about performance etc. I guess it's slow YuvarajMe: use the apache2 binary? vignesh-kumar19: compile it yourself or use something else. As on any other distro, too gdeverlant: use a build argument. There is no other way. Main reason: your containers should not depend on anything related to the host. If you need any kind of information inside the container: copy it or use a build argument. That's the way to go

solution: 

issue: this does not work from within a dockerfile, what should I be doing ? I'm trying to add a label from inside the dockerfile . LABEL GIT_REF="$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)" 
solution: 

issue: I'm pretty sure that you can't use$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)inside a LABEL tag. Reason: It doesn't run inside the container context, it only add Metadata to the image manifest (don't quote on me, but that was the conclusion I came to, when I thought about doing it)

issue: I'm having trouble with docker-compose and iptables. Something keeps wiping out our iptables, and we can't figure out what/why. Everything pretty much goes to hell when this happens.  We'd love to use a static iptalbe, but there's no guarantee that our exposed container is going to be reachable at the same ip/interface/bridge/what-have-you. How can we fix this? I've played around with creating another bridge, but I can't seem to change it's name on the system. It's dynamically generated and has the formbr-26a6c5ff90b7as listed byifconfig 
solution: 

issue: The docker daemon is setting up a bunch of rules that docker-compose is using for isolation/communication. We're not surewhatis doing it, but yes, something is completely wiping out iptables and breaking our services. docker-compose up does actually touch the iptables, as cycling docker-compose fixes the problem. I think wemighthave gotten it fixed.

solution: 

issue: Rahulkrishnan(rark)How can we attach iscsi volume in Docker containers Rahulkrishnan(rark)Sheogorath (Gitter): I searched for volume driver for docker for iscsi but could get any info related with it 
solution: 

issue: Rahulkrishnan(rark), if you want to use iscsi volumes as  docker volumes you have to search for a volume driver that supports it, or mount them locally and use the bind driver. I don't recommend using the bind driver for production because it maybe has bad performance. I think there are storage drivers using iscsi but only from proprietary storage providers/vendors. So probably you have to write an own plugin Westen0x: is that inside your container or outside in some docker directory?   No problem 
solution: 

issue: Well how you sync these directory is up to you. Some people actually use something like rsync in a cronjob, others run drdb I personally like to use glusterfs, but on a 3 node cluster (hint: you can't run swarmmodr on only 2 nodes, without loose the entire cluster when one manager goes down) This image doesn't look really useful to me. It runs the entire cluster on the same machine >.> What's the point of that?

issue: does docker cp turn on a container for the image, copy things in/out and then turn off that container? to be more clear, I have several docker cp calls in my build script that copies build artefacts out of the docker image to be held onto as cache, which is then copied back into the docker image before building dumb question, i'm already building a container, it's just not on

solution: 

issue: hello, i have a big big problem.. somehow rancher recreated a container and i lost all the data which were in the container.. is there any way to restore it? i did not have a volume attached 
solution: 

issue: renegoretzka: there is a little chance. If the image used for the container has decelerated the directory you need to restore asVOLUMEthere is maybe a unnamed volume remaining, that holds the data. Check withdocker volume ls. If not, it's gone but in general: no volume, no persistent data imaia: you have to declerate the volume path (inside the container) in theservices:inside your container, not in the volume section. There you decelerate things like the volume driver and options shawninder: should be fixed now 
solution: 

issue: renegoretzka: I recommend you to use this amazing plugin that I'm using in my cluster with docker swarm It's a legacy plugin but it does the job  [<-LINK->] it will create your volumes with persistency and never delete them like when you use docker run -v /path/to/my:/path/to/container but with volumes it is very usefull 
solution: 

issue: hi guys, i would like to ask if is it possible to use docker in windows 2008 server?

issue: Interesting, thanks Carlos!  So I'm trying to create a Docker image for my automated mobile tests for iOS.  I would then pass that image to Shippable, in order to create continuous integration - Shippable detects a change to the repo, then kicks off tests in the Docker image.  If I created a Docker host in network mode, would this conceivably be able to communicate with my local machine, i.e. actually run the tests on my local machine, after being triggered from Shippable (cloud based)? Ok thanks.  So there's really no method yet to use xcode command line tools in a regular cloud hosted docker container? lol owned by Apple says it all.  Oh well thanks for the info!

issue: I'm a bit of a beginner with linux - could anyone help explain why I can't update my docker engine I've ran: sudo apt-get update which includes Hit:8 [<-LINK->] xenial InRelease Then i ran sudo apt-get upgrade which said there was nothing to upgrade docker --versionDocker version 17.03.1-ce, build c6d412e I thought it had to be called docker-ce 
solution: 

issue: Apt-get update is to update the local package management database for apt, not for upgrading packages .  You probably just need to apt-get install docker again if your updating to a newer version 
solution: 

issue: the version its trying to install there is suuuuper old 
solution: yeah I thought it would be.. 

issue: yes, this should work@rossdargan not really. You have to overwrite the file shuntera: you can use the same script or useapt-get update && apt-get upgradeas usual rightisleft: you can maybe use an environment variable if you want. But that doesn't make the things easier

solution: 

issue: jbelmont: This can't work. You can use multiple from for multi-staged builds, but you are still limited to oneFROMper image in general. So at the end of the day you can use golang as base image OR mhart/alpine-node. If you need go inside your container use the node base image and install go. Or use the go base image and install node. It mainly depends on when you need what. I personally recommend to use the base image for the environment you want to use in runtime, not during build.

issue: JinnaBalu: simply install everything you need. what's the problem? JayZeeGP: you want them to write commands on start of your image or during build?

issue: if anyone has the same problem - I had to change driver from auft to overlay2 in/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/10-machine.confand start manually the service. the change was somehow introduced from 17.05 to 17.06 , but I couldn't find a binary to revert back to 17.05 to confirm it 
solution: 

issue: Hi everyone! I spent my last two days reading about docker and its concepts, but there's one thing I don't quite get: Take the example of nginx and php-fpm. Each comes in its own container and you would use docker-compose and link to make them work together. but both still have some redundant common base, e.g. alpine, even though they compose a service together. Why is the common way of doing things to link two independent containers instead of creating one container that contains both nginx and php (which would have less overhead, and possibly be more performant).

solution: 

issue: JnMik: i need your help if you success i need to run cassandra in three machines connecting to the same cluster please help me with the docker commands to run. Currently I am running Single node cluster, in one machine I want to run with multinode in three different machine, One node will be the contact point for my application \\ i need to configure this on three different machines what is the right way to achieve this 
solution: 

issue: Well I do have my cassandra cluster running at the moment, healthy and everything What's the issue with yours ? The only thing left to solve in my setup is the deployment strategy for 1 container per node and I'll solve it with labels. sysadmin convinced... ! Well, not really but he gave me the "go" to test it in our developement environement lol 
solution: 

issue: JnMik: points to benoted. Quorum is new to me. If you have any docker commands or docker compose for cassnadra please send the configuration I have currently having 32 gb 3 server, i'll run elastic search and cassandra in two machines , application and cassnadra on one machine, I will run application with docker stack deploy or docker compose. 
solution: I want to experiment, but if you have so that would save my day. Anyways I go nice inputs to work on from@JnMikand@SISheogorath. 

issue: Hi all, whenever I rebuild my container, it always build from scratch even though I only change a file that's ADDed in the last step. I believe it's theRUN apk updatecommand I use that stops the cached image version from being used. Does RUN invalidate the cache? How can I make it so I don't have to rebuild from scratch? here's my Dockerfile [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: sabrehagen: It shouldn't invalidate that caching layer if you haven't changed that line. What docker version are you running and what command do you use to build your image?

solution: 

issue: i tried many times to understand what docker is. please tell me if i am wrong we are using images as environments like .net or something else and put our app in .net image, so our app runs on every machine same way? SISheogorath: so when we run our app on another machine, it runs on same filesystem and settings right? to my understanding, when we run our app in container, docker creates virtual filesystem and arrange settings for this container. SISheogorath: no, i have limited experience with unix and linux

solution: 

issue: this is supposed to run inside of an Alpine image arm64-alpine 
solution: well, as I already asked, do you run the image/container of the image privileged?. 

issue: anything from SELinux or AppArmor? Maybe you run into limits there? and as already mentioned, you should verify that the container is actually running in privileged mode Also verify that the binaries in your image work and are not for another architecture /o\\ that would be the worst case

The first is inserted through/etc/docker/daemon.jsonand is what I want. The 2nd is appended by docker (libnetwork) and prevents proper usage.

issue: Hello. I’m developing a very unique application and it involves starting and stopping hundred of containers. So far on my Mac I’m only able to get 1.8 containers/sec (containerCreate + containerStart) using the golang sdk (which to my knowledge just invokes the http api) does anyone know what kind of throughput docker can support? Does that number seem normal (about 1~2 container starts per second). I could not find much documentation on that kind of benchmark online I’ve given my docker for mac 7 cores and 14gb of memory, and switched to the overlay2 storage driver, is there anything else I could try to get maximum startup performance, I am just running an alpine container that performssleep 600 
solution: 

issue: gdverlant: Well, what you need then is to use an public DNS Server and reference the IP of your host service the registry. If you run it in swarm, then any swarm member. Or if you don't want to go for an public DNS server you have to provide a default DNS Server to your DinD instance which knows the needed DNS names. kerbymart: Hi ninogomez: not really, and it doesn't make a lot of sense because in dockerlocalhostis broken. So it's better to fix the software Simply use the--dnsoption of the deamon Simply usels ./react-appfrom the directory your docker-compose.yml is in. If you want to have the "in container" view, usedocker exec -it $(docker-compose ps -q <servicename>) /bin/bashthen run ls for the path you specified MaxGoh: The word you are searching for is: Reverse Proxy checkout Traefik.io

issue: been using docker toolbox on windows everything ok. now i've changed to ubuntu. it says for ubuntu server, i can still use this on ubuntu desktop can i ? this is for docker ce, i can't get docker toolbox for linux 
solution: cavapoo2_twitter: : you’re right, it isn’t exists a docker toolbox for linux, you can use docker itself from the ubuntu apt repository.. docker ce is the community edition for linux systems, and docker toolbox is utility to use docker on windows and osx. 

issue: Docker toolbox more precisely provides a tooling around a Linux VM with docker-ce installed

I think I can't do the latter, because the schema is managed via migrations and is subject to change could you clarify the first sentence?@karanhiremath thank you

solution: 

issue: crebuh: IMHO, setup your host nginx as reverse-proxy to provide reqests from Internet to dockerized php dockerized php exposes 9000 port (if you use php-fpm). and host nginx must have fastcgi_pass localhost:9000 in nginx.conf file (or IP:9000 if you set up container with bridge network) mcarpenterjr: htop for host processes, ctop show info about containers in realtime (use docker stats)

solution: 

issue: rsegecin: You can use distributed storage, like S3, to mount a volume on your Docker container [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: I have a question with named volumes When create one with local-persist driver and map it to some directory in user home, app/ for example. app/ has permissions 775 and 1000:1000 Then i've run new container with nginx:latest with this new volume as /usr/share/nginx/html. Container change permissions of app/ to 755 0:0 (e.g. root) I've change permissions to 775 1000:1000 again recursively. Copy my files inside. All good and works. But when i re-create container (change nginx config for example) with docker stop-rm-run, permissions to app/ (only for app/ ) 755 0:0 again. If i simply re-run container with docker stop-start, all fine. With shared folders never see the same :(

issue: is there a way with supervisord to promote a subprocess' shell to the foreground? within a docker container of course 
solution: 

issue: ebcodes: acording to [<-LINK->] there issupervisorctl fg <process> it's the same as outside of a docker container. Keep in mind the container only provides the environment for your software. Not more, not less. No magic involved rsoeldner: do they run in different containers? Well, this can't really work because you need to run supervisord first before you can attach the application in general it's not a good idea to do this but it's possible 
solution: 

issue: I receive strange  errors inside a docker container. My jvm application writes files to disk and directly call another process with a system call.

issue: Is there a way to set password on a docker deployment? 
solution: 

issue: that makes me even more torn :/ I never update my config, so that's no problem, and I'll stopp all containers and launch new ones whenever I refresh the app anyway... BUT I was planning on copying in all my files into my container... But I don't know if nginx can access the files if they are inside the php-fpm container? 
solution: Richard87: as@igorbarkowskyalready pointed out. Both work. If you are already familiar with nginx and php-fpm that's the better way to go for you. If not, I would suggest to use the Apache combo. If you know neither Apache, nor nginx, apache is easier to start, nginx better to master :D. 

issue: @Richard87But I don't know if nginx can access the files if they are inside the php-fpm container?Maybe, volumes_from: directive in docker-compose.yml helps you. [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: hello, i'm starting in docker and i have a project in python, i manage its dependencies with virtualenv, so reading many tutorials the recommendation is install virtualenv inside the docker image, but if i have my virtualenv in the host machine, why do not just copy using copy or add commands and not build a new virtualenv?

And it confuse me as hell and i even dont know where to look at anymore.  Here is all details [<-LINK->] ndpratas: it is on that post on SO. But here it is too: [<-CODE->] ndpratas: my host for docker is localhost e.g. 127.0.0.1 . Other port sharing works fine e.g. nginx, postgresql. It only doesnt work for mongo-db via docker-compose. It works for mongodb via docker. And it works for everything else via docker-compose. netstat show as expected e.g.TCP    0.0.0.0:27017          0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       25132 carlosjgp: yes port mapping. No i dont have any other containers and i tried to map to different host port same result. No error in docker-compose 
solution: ndpratas: it writes Connecting To localhost... and then clear screen and in command line again and thats it.. 

issue: aldarund: Port sharing? you mean port mapping? Which error reportsdocker-compose? Do you have any other container running with a port mapped to the same port (27017)? as@ndpratassuggested usenetstatto find it out ordocker ps aldarund: So why do you think/know it's not working ondocker-compose? Can you post how do you run Mongo withdocker run? So it's not that you can't connect to Mongo, it's that an error is throw after connecting (sorry I'm not a Mongo user) aldarund: Could be an error related to the container, or thedocker-composeordockeryou are using.I'll recommend updating both and if it doesn't work raise a GitHub ticket for the Mongo image, I use lots of other containers withdocker runanddocker-composeand they behave in the same wayTry to update your Mongo image toodocker pull mongo:latest aldarund: So, in my opinion, that container is "broken" try an older version and see how it works

issue: hey guys. Problem withAutoteston cloud.docker, described there: [<-LINK->] Essentially I wonder if docker-compose.test.yml is run without docker-compose.yml so the thing doesn't work?  [<-CODE->] ^ docker-compose.test.yml  [<-CODE->] ^docker-compose.yml I read part1-6 already do you mind being a bit more specific ? my files are not "stack files" I guess? I dont understand, do I have to make a different compose file for docker cloud? sorry I dont understand. if you could make complete sentences..

issue: Hi There.. I have an docker with an old installation of PHP5.3 because I need it for transition of a project.. I link the web directory into the docker.. But now I dont have the right User and Group inside Docker to make the files run with Apache.. Can I tell Docker to rewrite the user and group he gets to another, inside the container 
solution: mpathy: I don't know if you can do it directly with Docker. If you can't,  you can use this : [<-LINK->]. 

issue: If i need to give a secondary user access to the docker daemon using the official docker-dind image - whats the proper group requirements?  [<-LINK->] will that work for dind? i didnt see a def docker group only dockremap 
solution: so when i look at the group who owns the sock file, inside the go container, it saysroot        993. 

issue: i have a container which must accept git commits over ssh, i am not sure yet if this is the best practice or way its a machine to receive code, build and deploy it and i now see in the dockerized sshd example they say that the env commands wikl be discarded because the way the sshd is run(using CMD) so@denel-manilovi guess i can do the echo "export VAR=X" >> /etc/profile trick but then i repeat some lines in my Dockerfile since i need them for the build process as well 
solution: 

issue: for example, you are developing a site on the PHP so as not to build an image for each code change you mount the volume with the directory of your code inside the container

solution: 

issue: Hello everyone, it's again me with all my  problems.. I get docker to run my app it tells me that [2017-12-01 12:05:53 +0000] [14] [INFO] Listening at: [<-LINK->] (14) however nothing loads on 0.0.0.0:8000 I'm not sure where to find my app. I looked up the IP for nginx, and for the django app i.e. [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->] but also there nothing... where it's running> ?? 
solution: 

issue: your local docker container may be running at 8000 but you need to expose that port right? so you may map that port from the container (8000) to the host (23456) so then it would be localhost:23456 
solution: 

issue: How can I get the mac/hardware id of host in container ? I want to license my app binding with the host,  and my app deployed with container. So,  need to get host id(MAC/host name etc.) on runtime. 
solution: 

issue: koolay Linux or Windows container? Found this from Docker CLI \'docker inspect <container name or id> |grep MacAddress|tr -d \' ,"\'|sort -u\' what language? 
solution: Maybe I’ll using anther solution. Running a license server in host, then the app verify license  with license server, since license server can obtain id of host.. 

issue: hey everyone, I have docker running fine on my localhost however when I change some code I need to run againdocker-compose up --buildso that it's reflected I'm trying to understand how to avoid that in development I think that I understood that using volumes is the way to go is that right? on my nginx image I have these volumes: [<-CODE->] while on my web I have: [<-CODE->] does this.:/codemeans: the local folders in this path (.) represent the folders in the container under the path/code? if this is the case, why it doesn't work? 
solution: 

issue: przemolb: When you create a volume, it is stored within a directory on the Docker host. When you mount the volume into a container, this directory is what is mounted into the container. This is similar to the way that bind mounts work, except that volumes are managed by Docker and are isolated from the core functionality of the host machine.A given volume can be mounted into multiple containers simultaneously. When no running container is using a volume, the volume is still available to Docker and is not removed automatically. You can remove unused volumes using docker volume prune.

solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] Originally I didnt have the entry point and was wondering why the docker build was just running forever but then once I saw your bit I realised I needed to have the last commandclamdto be an entry point yeah yeah, but thanks to seeing your stuff, it helped me solve my own so as you were soldier nothing to see here

issue: Hi guys, I have an application container (php+apache) where all the code etc is inside the docker image... but It's incredibly slow! (again, the container have no volume mounts), it takes about 3-4sec pr request (testet with [<-LINK->] ) while the regular linux host processes a request in 200-300ms... What can I do? 
solution: 

issue: hello there. pls help. why i can't access from php container to postgres container ? 
solution: 

issue: docker has an api you can connect to over tcp? maybe http? that you can communicate with, and I'm trying to figure out if there's a simple way to expose it to a container app, so that app can communicate with that instead of a volume bound /var/run/docker.sock (or whatever) well that's because your daemon doesn't start I'd check your system logs journalctl 
solution: yeah, because I get an error from containerd, grpc: the connection is unavailable. 

issue: if you're using overlay, does that mean that your volumes are actually stored in/var/lib/docker/overlay? 
solution: It seems like it :/. but It seems the data is in the volumes folder. 

issue: hey, I'd like to have log output show when Idocker run. Is that possible? and have ittailthem so i can keep seeing output? 
solution: 

issue: truthadjustr: it logs all std:out and std:err from your container. Which means as long as 1 process starts in your container, yes. it's entire output is captured if no process is started because you want to start a program in a path that doesn't exist, for example, it won't can't capture the output since there is no process. But it'll iirc tell you indocker ps -a simply dodocker logson it. Logs persist as long as the container exists. So when you don't start it with--rmyou are fine checkdocker ps -aif you need the container id, but names work withdocker logs, too even when they are killed don't use the -f flag for them

issue: elcolie: keep in mind that the php image doesn't use the packaged version of php I just wanted to mention that because you may run into a problem like: Mhm, why is php twice in that image When the driver depends on the php package and the php package is not installed by default… I guess you understand ^^ Maybe check the "add more extensions" section [<-LINK->] If that doesn't work, then maybe And you should maybe usephp:5-apache 
solution: As mentioned, follow the instructions for extending the image, not blindly use package management. It'll fool you in this case. Since it'll install a php version you don't want. 

issue: check how the container exited when it's 127 (or 128?) then you have to check where the binary is. Otherwise I suggest to exec into the container and start a regular debugging and by exec into the contianer I mean doing something likedocker run <your parameters> -it --entrypoint /bin/bash <yourimage>and then run your commands manually with debug flags etc the 101 linux admin job ^^

Thanks Frederik, obviously first time I hear kubernetes, will look at. Systemd look necessity for the purpose. Since I had run 8-9 months of nonstop containers never faced with a process stop issue, but it pinned to my head nowadays. 
solution: 

issue: JohnyWaynen_twitter: If you want container health / orchestration you can add kubernetes on top of your docker these two work perfectly in sync with each other You would need to add some kind of health check inside your container that kubernetes can react upon It depends on what your container cotains, but Systemd is defiantly one road you can take if its a web or a java application with Spring Boot there is web interface you can use to do health checks

Same if I map it onto another port, like-p 1234:9011 and my Dockerfile does have anEXPOSE 9000 9011line I don't think it's the application's fault because it works just fine outside the container

issue: good day to all...May I join in and ask for some assistance? I am running a docker swarm and having this strange issue.Adding a network to a service will stop it from coming up and be stuck at "starting". Anyone have any idea on how to tackle this issue? cs-mahmoud-khateeb: why would you do that? the container already "inherits " the resolv.conf file from the host so, pretty much, any address the host can resolve the container could also no? @cs-mahmoud-khateeb I believe you can set the IP for the dns in the daemon.json (so, in your local docker daemon) instead of setting it in the container itself.It may not be as clean as you would hope but at least it keeps matter separated.https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/custom-docker0/ then you can set the dns to be whatever the host's IP is 
solution: 

issue: is there a way to let a container (in bridge mode) use the host for dns queries without hardcoding the host ip address within the container ? felps: it doesn't work if the host's resolver lives on the hosts itself (in case of having a discovery service for example). I am using172.17.0.1but I feel it's a hack that will give me headache down the road.

(In your example docker) when it now finds a container with this prefix, which is not listed as a service in its compose file, it expects that it was deleted from it but the container was never stopped and this way became an orphan container

issue: “Still waiting for any and all assistance with my gunicorn/docker issue” 
solution: 

issue: is it possible to connect to mysql port 3306 from another container without exposing the 3306 port from the mysql container docker file? exposing is exposing the port to host for outside connection or also for docker bridge network I need to expose certain port? I have a bridge network setup up on all my containers with static ip. I don't want to expose the mysql port to outside world through the host. I only want the httpd container to be able to access the mysql container to access databases.

issue: yes, all ports of containers are accessible when they are on the same network exposing is only needed for external services and don't uselinksbecause you expose all environment variables of container A to container B which is from a security perspective pretty ugly

solution: 

issue: I do not think you can "update" a container per say. You have to kill it and recreate it using the updated image I thnik you should schedule a pull of the image and be able to catch a change. This way you will avoid killing / recreating the container for nothing 
solution: 

issue: ye, just make sure to store your critical data outside of the container with mounts - so that you can recreate them at any time and keep your data yepp that should be part of this external script what do you use? cli commands, docker compose or some orchestrator? 
solution: but you should never write a cronjob that stops all containers like that, at some point when you add others you'r gonna be in for a surprise - always name them. 

issue: so if I wanted to make sure the container is always up to date I would have to schedule an external script that regularly kills the container and then recreates it?

issue: Hey folks, hope y\'all having great day/evening! I\'m working on configuring dev env for my team and I\'m packaging several services into Docker containers. It looks like I\'m almost there, but the problem I\'m having is the following: I have 3 services (app, db and redis). The last 2 will need to be accessible from the first one (app). As far as I understand, by default all of them live on the same virtual network and be able to communicate. So I use <links> directive under the app service to explicitly define that fact. However, when I try to ping / connect to the database container, I get "could not translate host name "postgres.local" to address: Name or service not known". Is there something I\'m missing? My assumption was that Docker will automatically add postgres.local (alias I defined in the Docker Compose file) to my app service and that container will be able to resolve the hostname.

issue: hi there . i want to add wordpress container in [<-LINK->] route and django app in api.example.com and example.com for serve react app. but i have problem with serving wordpress app in /mag what kind of stack should is use to this. i try jwilder/nginx and even traefik but i cant find any solution to do this. is there anyone that can help me to find the right solution ? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-ISSUE->] Could anyone please help me with this? I managed to find all of the workarounds to get till there, but when I restart the container it forgets the vhost.conf that I save I am using a volume to persist data. 
solution: 

issue: I use nginx as a reverse proxy and nginx or apache in the container. works for me. yes. I think it's better to have each service in a container and use nginx as a reverse proxy. but I'm probably wrong 
solution: 

issue: Greetings Everyone! I am stuck with the common problem that a dockerized nginx running in the proxied mode, does not pass client's real IP to subsequent containers. Deviad: How about mapping your vhost.conf as well? I mean make use of volume, and mark the file as ReadOnly(RO). So the file modification can be only one way. Containers consuming vhost.conf cannot modify the files content, it can only read it. Make the changes on the host machine, restart the web container, and your web container will spin up with new conf.

solution: 

issue: pavel-sindelka: EXPOSE 3000 just run the service to accept the connection on the said port, but it doesn't exposes to the external network.-pflag does expose the port to external network. Docker Network and System/Host network are two completely different network. Try creating one more container and front this container, access you new container, assuming you have named the new container as node_container, like curl [<-LINK->] . You should see the response because both are running on the same network, docker network. dstockhammer: Is nginx installed on your container ? zhuhuizhan: Try withdocker update --restart=no <container_id OR container_name>

solution: 

issue: General question, I’m training a CNN in a specific docker service, the service crashes as the swap memory gets full. It’s like if it stores everything from each epoch of the CNN instead of automatically deleting what isn’t used anymore.

issue: Guys, inside a docker service, I have a celery job that runs a CNN. The service crashes every time I run it, but it runs a little longer when I give it more swap memory. Solutions? Yes, the CNN works fine outside of docker. nickvermeer: use docker-compose. Definitely recommended. As you grow, use Kubernetes instead of swarm. That will allow you to orchestrate turning down machines for 24/7 up-time. zillerium: short answer, yes. hwkd: I never said it was better or worst. Kubernetes is more of an industry standard. It will be more helpful job wise if you work with that one anyway. Many companies are backing it, being open sourced from google after all. 
solution: Well you did mention to use Kubernetes instead of swarm. Just wanted to clear that out..

issue: Hey all! I'm trying to create a new container and connect it to an existing container, but I can't seem to get it right... [<-CODE->] I'm trying to get the new container to talk to the mongo container that is already running on the 'app-net' network, but I can't seem to get it right... What am I doing wrong here? I can connect to the mongo container from the host terminal, so I don't think that is the issue. alternatively (and preferably) how might I do it in a docker-compose.yml? [<-CODE->] still didn't work... [<-CODE->] is what I end up. And yes, setting the local port to 37017 is intentional DinoSourcesRex: I'm not sure what you mean by seed. Could you explain? 
solution: 

issue: papaiatis: our work flow for this is to just destroy the container if it is running and start it again. Docker should download the updated image if it has changed 
solution: 

issue: after reading through [<-LINK->] I understand a little better. But I'm still left a little curious, is seeding required to make the link work? bboyle1234: thank you! The problem was that I was actually using the wrong container name for my mongo container. This is an excellent piece of reference though, thanks! 
solution: 

issue: so I have an image, it's building and pushing to my private registry. Now I want to run an instance of that image/container on another linux host. This is where I'm having some hangups about the best way to do this. I have a dockerfile, as well as a docker compose that works when I run on my local machine. so, are compose files only really meant for local machines? I have a compose, which runs my app, memcached, and postgres server locally, just fine. I've got the build process figured out, and I'm pushing an image to a private remote registry. I want to now have another remote machine run that image as a container. problem is, it's in the project path, and uses sh files and such to build and execute.

issue: Hey guys, quick question. I'm having an issue with executing a command inside a container. If I run: [<-CODE->] And then on the bash shell of the container I run my command it works correctly with no issues. However, if I do this: [<-CODE->] It fails to execute correctly. I have even tried using a workaround in the following way: [<-CODE->] and [<-CODE->] With both failing because the container is not TTY while executing the standalone command works.Any ideas? To clarify, the command itself is not failing, it throws an error that otherwise does not appear by executing it directly. [<-CODE->]

solution: 

issue: DinoSourcesRex: if you exit docker, as in stop the docker process, your containers will exit if you restart the machine, the behaviour of the container will depend on the restart policy applied to the container I often have 'unless-stopped' as my restart policy, so they will start back up automatically unless, of course, I have manually stopped them with docker stop foo

solution: 

issue: Hm, sounds like you are using GitLab as your registry for Docker images instead of Docker Hub, correct? Well, I feel like a registry and a Git repository shouldn't really be related.

solution: 

issue: Hello, can anyone explain what could be going on here? I have a base image and I'm trying to start a container, but every time I run eitherdocker run { imageId }ordocker start { containerId }, the container immediately exits process I didn't see anything :/ This is consistent and I'm pulling from an official image on docker hub so idk what else could be happening 
solution: 

issue: Sounds like a broken image / broken container. What do the logs say? 
solution: 

issue: Hmm, what you could do is to save the actual database into the image so every time when you run it it's already has the data without initialization I would run the containerinitialize the databasesave out the files in mysql case/var/lib/mysqlcreate a dockerfile with a COPY so I have the dband build that as an image It should working with commit though 
solution: 

issue: I am not sure I followed all the conversation. But I think it is an interesting topic. If you want to initialize your db this way. You would need to make sure all "initial" set up si done in your image, and only starting the database remain in your container starting I didn't know this docker image, did you tried it ? seems to be what you want to do ... 
solution: I personaly would not use it on the long term because it seems a bit too custom for me.But for a first approach of the functionality; it seems to be a good start :). 

issue: you can mount the volume for the first run to initialize then mount it as readonly the datadir move would make sure that the database is not stored in a volume 
solution: 

issue: David... dumb question here... you're both exposing the port from the container and also from the system right? So when launching the container, you're specifying the port should be exposed and that's the same port you expose when building the container right?

I'm not sure if it handles the kerberos tokens though :D ^ in that regard it usually clearly throws an error that it is a certificate error, hanging is a weird issue, I only experienced it when my registry had a proxy try use the registry:2 instead latest I've had some error with the latest recently

solution: 

issue: limpep: not sure if I can help... but I've done this a lot.

issue: Greetings. Is there an easy way to allow inbound connections to docker container but block outbound connections? I'm using docker-compose.

I tried setting iptables rules on the host, but docker doesn't respect host rules unless you use a host adapter (i think?). And I do not want to use a host adapter.
