solution: 

issue: raniesantos: I think the only place the message will exist is if somebody was subscribed to instant notifications via email on a channel 
solution: 

issue: DutchMarcel: the email notification system is still fairly legacy and needs some much more significant change to bring it up to speed with desktop & mobile logic @lydatech not explicitly, but you can effectively do it by muting the conversation, unless they start @ mentioning you in the PM...is someone harassing you? if there's any issue, don't hesitate to report it to us here orsupport@gitter.imwith any logs/account info. 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I wonder how to rename my community because I can't find any feature on Gitter. 
solution: 

issue: is there a way to block someone from PMing you? not me. a user in our group but it hasnt been an issue yet 
solution: 

issue:  Can someone please explain me why does it say this?UDP like you just dont care :D 
solution: 

issue: i've tried to find how i can change my username./nickisn't listed as a valid cmd, and can't find anything in the KB. anyone? but that isn't my Twitter acc name, it's onlyjouni_kantola. the suffix_twittergot appended automatically ok. guess i'll have to settle with what i got then. thanks,@MadLittleMods. 
solution: 

issue: Who works on the design for the layout. It does NOT work for touch devices like my Surface Pro 4. I have a large list of one on one conversation and I'm not even able to scroll through the list. 
solution: 

issue: How do we delete Communities we’ve created? I took the intuitive route, but they still appear in the “Add a Room” dialog 
solution: 

issue: (I was wondering if Matrix bridge I [<-LINK->] was having some issue here as one line wasn't visible and also sorry for spam as my phone seems to be misbehaving at the moment, pasting is difficult) 
solution: 

issue: Hey How Can I remove a person from Chat room? I created the chat room but  I still can't remove a person It's a private chat room It'd be awesome if some one can help I am not getting a Remove option when I hover over the person image. I am getting that for other channels under same namespace :/ 
solution: 

issue: Hi I'm new to the community. It's nice to be here, I am just starting to work with Linux any advice would be greatly appreciated 
solution: 

issue: MikaelaEric Eastwood (Gitter): the link doesn't work on Gitter mobile client. And IIRC I tested a few days ago if the bridge was working here or not as one message got missed and got to conclusion that it worked and apologised for testing explaining what I was doing and where one could possibly get more information if they were interested.

issue: hey guys, can someone help me with my code? 
solution: 

issue: Wait, why can't i find the repo for the android app? Damn thats confusing, thanks for info tho@dragon788 
solution: 

issue: A suggestion: When a moderator deletes a message there should be a notice to the chat something along the lines of " This message has been removed by So-and-so" Is there any way to do something like this? grahamperrin: That makes sense. It was a topic that was brought up. You have given an eloquent way of putting my thoughts. Thank you 
solution: 

issue: @lydatech I'm relatively new to Gitter, have not yet encountered moderation but for what it's worth, I would prefer:(a) discretion by default; absence of a public notice.Why not public? Because a notice could be interpreted (by all readers) as penalising a person for an offence of unknown severity.Better for a writer to be discreetly (not publicly) given the opportunity, the encouragement, to express something in a way that will not invite repeat moderation. 
solution: 

issue: per what@mydigitalselfsaid you can also apply that as the default to all rooms after setting it for one, or at least there is a link there@joeblew99 the first is still open, probably the second was closed but linked to the first as a duplicate if you aren't using the Gitter.im web client you might not see the colored links, but they have lovely green for still open and red for closed 
solution: 

issue: is the irc gitter gateway open source? 
solution: I was looking for that 32 nicks limit per chan, I thought it was hardcoded. anddam: You can track [<-ISSUE->]. I see, so the API returns a certain amount of nicks (30 default) and the client doesn't know/has a concept it needs to query all the nicks through pagination. 

issue: I dont how its work? I'm in Europe and I had just a few channel that is normal guys? Thanks for reply me! ;) 
solution: 

issue: So, is there need to report unable to connect to tcp/irc.gitter.io:6667, or is that a known issue? 
solution: 

issue: mydigitalself: re: [<-LINK->] I'm in the UK. Tconcept22: this room is complementary to [<-LINK->] for help with Gitter 
solution: 

issue: Hello everyone!Is there any kind of sandbox room for me to test gitter's Markdown?Also I don't really like Gitter's Unread indicator and at slash all mentions as it force me to read messages that are unrelated to me. grahamperrin: oh it is not really obvious to new users. showing list of rooms when going to gitter.im homepage is better [my-2-cents] grahamperrin: i tried. it is reproducible.I am the person who open issues but never Pull Request 
solution: 

issue: I try to deploy my site in laravel from bitbucket to my host using git. I do "git clone" copy repo  but I dont understand how update my cloned repo on hosting, when I change him on bitbucket

issue:  [<-LINK->] @BluscreamCreate a new issue [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: is gitter blocking to show site information? normally in firefox there is the option at the left of the address bar to show page information ok then I guess it's an issue with my browser firefox what? 
solution: 

issue: @MadLittleMods @julisan1 I guess these suggestions? 
solution: 

issue: ok, makes sense since # gives you tightly integrated GitHub issues/PRs so it wouldn't work for a channel name 
solution: 

issue: almost daily running firefox if i leave gitter running I get an error that a script is not running correctly. Then I have to stop it and restart gitter. The script ishttps://cdn02.gitter.im/_s/7136ee1/js/vendor.js:9is this a known bug?  [<-LINK->] image to followup on the above question 
solution: 

issue: grahamperrin: archives working for me.. maybe fixed since you asked lydatech: never got that error for me on firefox 51.0b6 win 10 64bit. Then again, I don't usually run for over a day. Pressingdebug scriptand finding more details about the error might help? 
solution: 

issue: @grahamperrinhttps://gitter.im/trueos/Lobby/archives/all remains cold and empty after ten or more consecutive reloads.yep I'm having problem as #1528 i.e. network issues, it seems specific to that room. I'm on chrome; not using gitter.next

issue: hello every one i have one problem any one guide me?....Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'msie' of undefined(…) MadLittleMods: yes sir? 
solution: 

issue: I think he's saying read the linked message from that timestamp seems a lot of people end up in here by accident 
solution: 

issue: I'm having a problem with git, and am wondering if someone can help me 
solution: 

issue: Have any one got this problem ? [<-ISSUE->]  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Anyone know how the Gitter link parsing logic is implemented? Will a pasted linkusuallyshow the actual URL to which it points? (I sayusuallybecause it seems that links to certain locations -- GitHub at least -- are treated specially, withAvailable on GitHub. Or is this behavior over which the user has control via Markdown?) My concern is the potential to click on a malicious link that is disguised as something else. Absent the ability to e.g. hover-over the link and see where it actually points, doesn't that seem a bit risky? (thank you for responding so quickly, by the way!) 
solution: 

issue: cbj4074: Could be. Browser link peek, SSL certs, and the address bar help the situation. It's not something I am worried about but trying to think of the genuine situations it would hurt if changed 
solution: It actually strikes me as a fairly serious concern. What's to stop bad actors from posting links dressed-up as links to GitHub repos or something equally innocuous-seeming? We all know that all it takes to be compromised these days is clicking on a malicious link of a certain variety.. 

issue: hi everyone i am new to gitter , can anyone tell me how i can use with my project? 
solution: 

issue: pasting a multi file Gist seems to greatly uglify the Gist preview functionality note the trailing slash on the second word vim/sed syntax is s/badword/replaceword/(magic gitter doesn't have) appears to be could be straight up busted and you can only edit 1 message back, not within a whole block not busted, because 'appears to be' was "also" before :) 
solution: Yeah, in IRC you just receive the messages from gitter so you see the pre edit and edited texts. 

issue: how do you trigger text correct s/word/repacewiththis ? I tried just typing that on the next comment but it didn't work s/work/workie  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: you can only edit 1 message backI have not noticed that restriction. 
solution: 

issue: Has anyone had the issue of all fonts being italic? Using Edge It only happens on one of my machine Clearing cache, signing out etc nothing helped 
solution: And it started totally out of nowhere. 

issue: Just eavesdropping here... I wouldn't necessarily assume that Microsoft isn't modifying the OS without your explicit knowledge or consent. So "out of nowhere" may not apply here. 
solution: 

issue: that doesn't look normal at all, does it look like that in other browsers? like FireFox? nope it's not really documented, it's just always existed 
solution: 

issue: mydigitalself: is this feature of being able to tell whether or not someone read a message documented somewhere? I don't think Slack has this feature. 
solution: 

issue: Read receipt is the kind of feature that makes me not want to use gitter. It encourages antisocial tendencies and violates my privacy. The first one is more arguable. 
solution: 

issue: I just accidentally deleted a huge message I wanted to edit. Why the hell Gitter neither asks for confirmation nor offers cancellation?! grahamperrin: @dragon788My problem was that I clicked delete whle my intention was to click edit. The message was removed immediately without confirmation or cancellation. BTW, I complained about this problem like a year ago. 
solution: 

issue: Would it help if the system could recognise an edited post of, say, five characters or less as an accident? dragon788: @lolmausdone, you can try for yourselves at [<-LINK->] . For some users at some computers where drag and drop is attempted, this notification from gitter.imError Uploading File. Could not find a bored instance. No responsive uploaders Compare (a) my https://gitter.im/trueos/Lobby?at=585734d8d99b1dd03d2d211e and my post a few hours later in the same room and the subsequent report from @Mystified1234 with (b) my https://gitter.im/trueos/troubleshooting?at=5857863f61e516c1578e1edb good result at an adjacent notebook with a superior connection to the Internet.@Mystified1234 what's your geolocation?

issue: Hello world,  Is anybody here new to Linux? what is the difference between BSD and Linux? I'm just starting out on my adventure in the CPU world and want to eventually get to do some coding!

solution: Agreed. 

issue: Hi there! Is Gitter.com unstable? Or is it my laptop? Keeps crashing. It crashes often. Now it doesn't show my last line.  Anyone? ? 
solution: 

issue: Happy new year folks!@liam4unfortunately, chrome --app= [<-LINK->] then seek the wordGitterexposes a known issue on some platforms; the long list of search results is without a scroll bar, which can beextremelyfrustrating if the user is without a mouse with a scroll wheel. Workaround: zoom out until the scroll bar appears. revisualize: join me at [<-LINK->] , the explanation will be probably not specific to Gitter. Hic.  [<-LINK->]

issue: Hello everyone. Why does Gitter client have such a high energy impact on mac OS? It constantly reports as high energy impact and that it requires the discrete graphics chip on macbook pro THis is while running in the gitter client and while running in safari. running in Chrome does not appear to have that issue I've also noticed a lot of spinning when posting messages with markdown on a very slow or flaky network/internet connection is this some issue with gitter client itself or more likely a safari/webkit issue?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: AABatteries: i noticed that the server was sending a /who query once a minute... perhaps your client is not responding, so the gateway disconnects you? zachwelch: things that a per-minute /who query is a bug too, but whatever... zachwelch: has yet to hear a response to issue that he has brought up here, so i'm kinda losing my interest in using this platform irc just works AABatteries: if it's not a settable option, then it's probably a code change AABatteries: i'm not familiar with that client, so i don't know what knobs you can turn AABatteries: if it's not responding (which, again, is just a theory), then it probably is just disable (or returning information that the server doesn't like) AABatteries: thanks for that feedback. i'd be curious to hear if you can see them on IRC when you type messages into the webUI while connected via IRC that would pretty much confirm my hypothesis that the behavior is by design right...  bug zachwelch: wonders who is in charge around here

issue: Room organization? Like, a lot of rooms? 
solution: 

issue: Is [<-ISSUE->] going to be fixed at some point?I may be wrong, but it seems like an easy fix, and the issue has been open for over a month now. texas2010: That's normal. Your connection is just slightly unstable or your connection to the Gitter servers has high latency. 
solution:

I have a problem with send message often. when i send message in chat room. it keep delay then post it in chat room act like internet was disconnect. but my internet is fine. my internet dont have a problem.  it is more like gitter problem.

issue: Hello, Gitter!My name is Ionut (written with an "i")I checked the topics and this problem doesn't pertain to any of them.I tried to install the Gitter desktop messenger app.Upon scanning it on virus-total.com it came up with 2 VIRUS warnings. Even if it is a false positive, I'm not inclined to install it. Too bad because I checked the Chrome Task Manager & this webpage takes  158.000 of my RAM.

issue: Question regarding third-party permissions with GitHub and Gitter. If I transition an organization from "no restrictions" to "restricting 3rd party access", will there be any unforeseen issues or outages? Is it as simple as approving Gitter once again? I’ve referred to [<-LINK->] but it only addresses the initial setup of Gitter community, not transitioning OAuth permissions.

A long time ago I accidentally removed Gitter Private integration on GitHub, gitter broke, I contacted the support, they did some magic and it started working again (as far as I remember), but I never added that integration back. Could it be because of that?

solution: 

issue: glennbennett: do you mean viewing its source code or you are visiting normally 
solution: 

issue: pysantanyi_twitter: thanks. The first is reminiscent of [<-ISSUE->] , which is closed but (to me) the symptoms remain horribly problematic and I can not positively identify the symptoms here with other, open, issues that are linked from the closed one. Do you use Firefox? 
solution: 

issue: Why are comment edits on GitHub counted as new comments in activity? I nearly spammed up the activity section in another chat because of that, which wouldn't be fair to issues that commanded the same priority, and can lead to potentially abusive behaviour by burying another issue with "Edits" to an intentionally typo-filled post. 
solution: it can/should be dealt with at the repo level.But it can also be dealt with here whereby editing the same one comment with more information doesn't post the same comment in activity. If there is more information to be had for a single bit of activity that is appended later, it should be the submitter's responsibility to announce there was an edit to said comment on gitter with significant information.If I forget some punctuation, misspelled a word, then saw Aw crap, I misspelled another one I shouldn't be polluting activity with those tiny, insignificant changes in any community. I don't check myself compulsively all the time to prevent these mistakes. That, and my laptop's keyboard sucks.I could also, y'know, leave the mistakes in but I don't want to look like I didn't make it out of high school with honours.. 

issue: B5Bena_twitter: This room is for Gitter support, not general technical support. Please read the welcome message when joining a room and mind the topic/description at the top of a room. You should probably go through [<-LINK->] ramses0: See [<-ISSUE->]

issue: Hello gitter devs, Has there been any change in the rules for sending by email, the notification of unread messages? I do not access gitter all the time, so this is a feature I liked. mydigitalself: ok. 
solution: 

issue: I'm not seeing much at [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: I have my own gitter room. But I can't delete my room, maybe because leaving. How to fixed that? InternetUnexplorer: @arch-masteryes. I'm not owner anymore 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I am using Gitter Mac application, but everytime I click to a notification from Gitter, it doesn’t show the latest messages in the room. I had to scroll down to see the latest messages. It is a bug? arch-master: Is it not about direct messages, I mean the room :) Anyway, great app, thanks.

issue: Anyone know how to add this to quassel? It shouldn't be this hard >_< ok I need some help, I still can't get connected using quassel and I know it's possibly or should be but it's not working for me.... never mind, I got it setup I was able to get myself up and running in quassel >_< 
solution: 

issue: Anyone with permissions here?You can try mentioning MadLittleMods or mydigitalself, they are often in this room. If all else fails, creating an issue should work, @beeman. 
solution: 

issue: I'm new here and Any one help me , I can't find a chat room based on web penetration testing and Kali Linux 
solution: 

issue: So, I went to create a community for my organization, and specified "lyndir" as my organization domain, which it linked to github.com/Lyndir, and "masterpassword" as the community name, thinking I was creating a "masterpassword" room inside the domain.  Apparently, that is not what it does and it created a gitter community at [<-LINK->] called "masterpassword".  Can I get this community renamed to "lyndir"? Interestingly, gitter itself can't seem to make up its mind on what to call this organization, calling it "masterpassword" in some places and "lyndir" in others...  quite buggy. Perhaps I can just delete this and start over somehow? where would I go for technical support on this? 
solution: 

issue: MadLittleMods: It would be grand if I could get an opinion on the above or a pointer on how to go about reporting this issue in a way it can get looked into / resolved.  It appears communities are rather immutable right now and furthermore communities with names that do not match their domain cause countless strange bugs.

issue: I'm in a classroom next to the troll who has been banning everyone next to him, can I get a repeal? 
solution: 2012728: @lxBlakexl@BenQ77What is the username of the troll? Which room did this happen in? Why is the troll an admin of the room? Who should be an admin?. 

issue: its true. i would like to graduate. diegolg got me banned i'm innocent 
solution: . lydatech:. 

issue: That person definitely didn't test their bot beforehand... it doesn't read like they planned, I bet. 
solution: 

issue: argh, thought i copied his username before deleting those messages, clearly not ah cool, tks 
solution: 

issue: I see Ive been mentioned.@MadLittleModsWhats up? MadLittleMods: @BenQ77Ben wwas banned I banned him. The message has been deleted but it was a proper ban 
solution: 

issue: Metoer2017: Hi meteor. Unless you enjoy introducing yourself before asking for technical support relating specifically to the gitter chat service, I suspect you may be in the wrong room. saparvia: If your messages aren't getting through, perhaps mention MadLittleMods. He is often active in this channel and can likely find out why your emails haven't been getting through. darsparx: Services have been having some issues a few weeks ago. I heard that they were resolved, I guess not? Hmmm. This is why gitter needs a service status page. If I had time, I'd make one, but it would be better if there was an official one. ShaikNazeer: stop it. You're in the wrong room and you've been pasting that question everywhere. Questions like that are not for this room. gitterHQ/developers. I see you already posted there. 
solution: yeah I only know of it because I'm in there though I've not messed with angular in forever since I'm more focused on my c++ stuff right now. 

issue: ok I'm a little werided out, I'm using the irc connection and I'm wondering why is the thing constantly rebooting itself at least 2-3 times a day? nope, it's still rebooting several times it did it twice last night apprently actually 4 times 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys, been using gitter for a while but noticing an issue on one machine only: The edit button is always disabled. I know it disables after a period of time. But on that machine, "edit" disables immediately. And this is on both chrome and firefox. I have tried dumping cookies and cache, but no change. Anyone else observe this behaviour? Anywhere else I log into gitter, no problem. MadLittleMods: HI Eric, no I don't have the twitterz. Only a github account. Been using gitter for a while now, these are messages I write, that are immediately locked off from editing. 
solution: 

issue: darsparx: we're not sure, we were only made aware of this recently, for some reason none of our alerting systems were telling us that the ircd was being restarted 
solution: 

issue: MadLittleMods: Any ideas on how to get my userbillyyumyum2x2functional again?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: it's done it 3 times since I looked yesterday mydigitalself: well it's definitely still doing it, it's weird 
solution: brianamarie: done :). 

issue: "Any room admin can now delete messages from other users now." according to [<-LINK->] . Flagging spam is an open issue, it appears: [<-ISSUE->] pdurbin: subscribed too mydigitalself: thanks, that's very nice of you. However, I probably won't be deleting any messages because I connect through the IRC gateway and I can't imagine that deleting messages from there is supported. Now I'm curious if there's any tracking of who deleted the message and if it can be restored. That's good. Thanks. I'd highlight your name but I'm using the IRC gateway and I can't "tab complete" your nick/username, Graham. I'm not sure why. 
solution: 

issue: So, what ever happened to thetopicsfeature announced like 6 months ago?  [<-LINK->] All I see is the same single-thread-confusion in busy rooms :( Is this where we discuss gitter.next ? I have a fun bug where my left nav duplicates itself 
solution: Topics have been enabled for a while, it's a separate section per community. if you visit [<-LINK->] you should see them in the list there. 

issue: Hi, is there a way to create private rooms? it's mentioned on the Billing page and I could swear I used them in the past but now just can't find a way to do it. Oh never mind, found the way to do it from theAdd A Roombutton. Wasn't clear to me from the new community creation workflow. 
solution: pixxx: You can't reallyleavea private conversation, you can only hide it.. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] @KennethBruen_twitterYour name reflects your name on Twitter. You can't get rid of the_twittersuffix  [<-LINK->] @paulo-raoniTriple backticks ``` on separate lines above and below your code sdogruyol:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I'm not receiving email notifications for some time. Any idea? 
solution: 

issue: How do I create a room pointing to a private repository to a user, not an org? The two ways I've seen where I can create a room are both broken from my POV, the one under "All Conversations" on the left where I click "Add a room" forces me to use a community, and if I do not, selecting a room name based on my repos on GitHub just sends the background into a 404 and the create button stops working. That was this prompt: [<-LINK->] The second one, from [<-LINK->] is more stable, but I can't create a private room there. Also, I seem to be completely unable to delete communities, right now I've been testing this out and I've got 11 empty communities in my list I'd like to remove 
solution: Without selecting a community, typing the start of my repo under "Room name" and clicking on it sends the background of that popup into a 404 and breaks the create button. 

issue: Hi All Quick Gitter Q, is there a way to change your displayname?  Mine seems to have added "_twitter" to mine and I don't like it :D Can't seem to find a profile or acount page anywhere to update/manage it 
solution: 

issue: anyone using gitter app 64 bit on linux? MadLittleMod: my actual question is "is anyone using gitter app 64 bit on linux?", but I'm looking for responses from anyone using it to say yes. my inner demon concious says it was rude for me to reply like i did to you. I have a very sensitive inner demon concious. so im sorry if that seemed rude

issue: Hi, all,I found there are multiple subrooms under a repository, likehttps://gitter.im/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/earlyadopters MadLittleMods: Is sub-room an old feature inaccessible from current version of Gitter? 
solution: Atry: Yes. 

issue: Big news @/all! Gitter has been acquired by @GitLab.http://blog.gitter.im/2017/03/15/gitter-gitlab-acquisition/ He doesn't have access, yet,@Alex-Bond :) Alex-Bond: Gitter has excellent backups, thanks to@omame's hard work :)

issue: Was Gitter created just to support freecodecamp? Was the internet created just to support Facebook?@InternetUnexplorer No doubts that Karmically it was Why was both strings quoted, while i put > only on first? 
solution: 

issue: I highly doubt it. yes, nice starting point, thanks, I hadn't seen that, I don't believe 
solution: 

issue: To speakers of English who are not from Britain, a quickyes/noGitter-related question:without consulting a dictionary, do you equate "rhubarb rhubarb" with background noise? 
solution: If I search then browse [<-LINK->] I guess that I'll find a handful of issues about on-screen positioning of elements. tl;dr I reckon that the current position of the globe causes it to be overlooked or (as part of a set of elements) simply ignored by some newcomers.. 

issue: any way to reach the Gitter staff? I've sent a message but nobody seems to reply ticket, but no idea what's the ID (deleted the notification) my request is simple: delete a community that - from reason I cannot understand - I cannot delete, so I can recreate it again I've created the community not via the Github account so that might be an issue... just sent a ticket again:  [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: Razva: was the message via e-mail, or some other channel? [<-LINK->] kapilkd13: drop in the message field. 
solution: 

issue: Razva: looks like you created the group using a twitter account, not this GitHub account if you sign out, sign in with your twitter account, you can add your GitHub account as an admin listochkin: thanks! @AshleyGrant it will mean that Gitter will be open sourced, so perhaps the community could also help with search.also worth pointing out that all of our public conversations are indexed by google etc... and we see a lot of search happening off network, so the information is out there. 
solution: 

issue: … drop your favourite groups (only groups, not rooms) onto the bar.Thanks @mydigitalself does that explain:why I can not get GitterHQ to the left of that bar; and/or 
solution: for 1, if you click on Groups icon (the fourth one down) then drag GitterHQ onto the minibar. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] Is it no longer possible to get a gitter URL that mirrors your github URL, or is there some different way I should be doing this?

solution: 

issue: @jhalterman yip, we're moving away from being GitHub only, and step 1 has been to break away from personal projects namespace like that. right now we still respect GitHub's namespace, so the reason that can't be created is because /failsafe exists in the GitHub namespace.obviously as this unfolds, we'll be entirely breaking away from the GitHub namespace in the futurehttp://blog.gitter.im/2017/03/15/gitter-gitlab-acquisition/ 
solution: 

issue: my account can't send any message in gitter even in my private room...the api status code is 200 means the message is sent and return the message id , but when i using api to get the message by this return id , it return an 404 not found message. UserId : 58ca6fa0d73408ce4f51317d

issue: MadLittleMods: thanks for unlock , i just try to make a gitter ai to provide a translate and wiki command function who live under the china fire wall 
solution: 

issue: I've just persuaded a head of an open source project to use Gitter over Slack, and starting the community in Gitter was extremely frustrating for him. There seems to be no way to make thegitter.im/org-namechatroom public. And once a non-admin org member leaves that room, they can't get back in. And the mobile app seems to be feature-limited in regard of starting/managing a commnity. mydigitalself: Well, we just started a new community, and this special room was there, and we were clueless that it was special...

issue: Hi all. I'm trying to integrate gitter on our team's workflow. Last thing - are there any way to integrate it with redmine? I can hack redmine to send webhooks, but how can I instruct gitter, that #N - not gitlab's one, but redmine's ..? 
solution: Frodox: Not possible at the moment. You can track [<-ISSUE->] and [<-ISSUE->] which may mean a more general solution that would support redmine. 

issue: MadLittleMods: Same issue with that same user neal23mike. could we get a ban please. I have banned him from the FCC chats but hes contacting users via IM

issue: gitter for windows not good 
solution: 

issue: The missing scroll bar has reappeared. I wonder what causes it to sometimes not appear … if I can make it reproducible, I'll make an issue in GitHub. MannikJ: does the issue affect rooms that you have joined? Or is it limited to rooms that you have not joined? 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys,I just installed the gitter app for windows, and I think I typed the wrong github credentials password in during the OAuth process. Now, gitter asks for my permission (it does it anyways, despite the fact that my credentials were wrong) and when I click either deny or allow, the gitter window disappears. the process appears to be still running, though. is there a way to completely reset the typed-in credentials ? I tried uninstalling and re-installing it again, but the problem persists. 
solution: 

issue: Hi Gitter, is there any limitation to the chan avatar? I tried uploading a 256x256 png, but it just does not show up even after the small progress bar has completed its tasks hello@mbrsalman5 whoops, wrong chan, sorry 
solution: 

issue: How are you supposed to say Hi, if you dont familiarize yourself, or as familiarizing yourself would mean saying hello, now youre stuck in a while(true) loop. 
solution: But you cant say anything until you familiarize yourself.

solution: 

issue: grahamperrin:  you seem busy today! Thanks for the work you've been doing here, I'm surprised they haven't offered you a job yet :P 
solution: 

issue: I think they should add a feature to gitter that us lines to point to responses 
solution: 

issue: lexicalunit: i think you are getting an incorrect error message. at the moment, we "share" GitHub's namespace, so you can't havegitter.im/nanodbcas your url as there's already a github account with that name.

issue: Frodox: i'm afraid not at the moment not in the short-term, but it's something we'd like to do in the future 
solution: 

issue: is gitter even open source? Why hasn't anyone added user-blocking/muting for over 3 years Honestly even if it's a shitty clientside block, it would be like 10 lines of code 
solution: yeah I know, I commented in it when that dude was shitposting. 

issue: Yeah, I sympathize. I'm getting tired of it, too. 
solution: 

issue: Hi all, I have a doubt, If I sent a message to someone and then deleted it before he read it, would it still be delivered. Thanks Is there a fixed time we wait before sendingunread messagemail 
solution: 

issue: Folks, please consider shifting to [<-LINK->] for chat that does not relate directly to support. Thanks. 
solution: 

issue: Are there any plans of adding moderating features beyond /ban to gitter? (like mute) yeah, i know what you mean@grahamperrin, but since it is ignored since 2014 i thought I'd just ask. Running gitter in a community full of 11-14 year Minecraft wannabe developers is pretty difficult/rough when the only tool you have is /ban. Well, it's not like we paying for the services of gitter so I guess we can't really complain much about it. 
solution: Yeah honestly, it's just too hard of a feature to add.The gitter team just can't seem to wrap their head around it.Real stumped on this one.. 

issue: TitouanT: the font is fixed width.Are you sure you are properly formatting it? TitouanT: looks misaligned on my side as well. Specifically, it seems the┬character is out of line.

solution: 

issue: Hi Can someone tell me why I can't access to the freecodecamp chat room? Ohhhh okay I see thanks guys@MadLittleMods@grahamperrin 
solution: 

issue: Those amber/green statuses don't work (and never have). 
solution: 

issue: we added other moderation tools a while ago, including the ability for admins to delete messages and to set other admins, even if they aren't part of the GitHub org but the problem has certainly been growing and we'll look to do some self-moderation soon personal moderation is a bit more tricksy, it's not just a case of display:none, there are a few other considerations 
solution: 

issue: There's no question that it's a complicated problem. As I suggested in the aforementioned thread, why not just let client disable automatic image/video previews? That would solve a large part of the problem. And then you can work on the more complex aspects... but something needs to be done, like, now. 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I was trying to create a room for the "Angular" community, but I press the button and nothing happens, I check the console and: [<-CODE->] I'm not a member of the "Angular" team. I need to be a member of "Angular" to create separate room for that community? There's a lack of UX possibly due to that error. Yes, I tried to refresh the page. that error trigger every time I type on the name input form or click "create"

issue: InternetUnexplorer: @schas002FYI [<-ISSUE->] my recollection of the keywordmobilearises from theAndroid-related issue that is cross-referenced near the foot of issue 1004. 
solution: 

issue: I have issues. I am getting PM insults and belittling comments by an individual via this medium. Who do I report these issues to? LWSS: Just a note.. I saw your comment. I know it is in jest. But, I'm currently in the process of doing a live screen recording and doing multiple screenshots for my lawyer and employer. 
solution: 

issue: revisualize: I am sorry to learn of those misbehaviours.I have some privileges, but not enough to take appropriate action in a case such as yours. I assume that a (more privileged) moderator will chat privately with you as soon as he or she reads your post. moderator-alert  [<-LINK->] above leads to a related issue in the GitHub repository for Gitter. Please using voting to emphasise comments in that issue (you'll see my votes there); add another comment there, if you feel the need. 
solution: 

issue: Hello everyone, I have a GitHub organization and I had 2 chats, one for each repository of the project those repositories have been moved to BitBucket and I'm unable to configure it to work with the repositories (the feeds) 
solution: 

issue: MadLittleMods: i already had a chat with@revisualize Zoey76: do they still exist on GitHub? 
solution: right... that's going to be a problem then. if the room was created from a GitHub repo, and the repo no longer exists, the room is not going to work any more. 

issue: Hiding roomsI'm almost certain that I have hidden https://gitter.im/gitlabhq/gitlabhq at least twice but just now I found a green numbered badge for the room and again I hid the room.Has anyone else found a similar symptom, with any other hidden room behaving as if it is not (or no longer) hidden? 
solution: 

issue: Wonder why Windows Defender doesn't squawk about it. 
solution: check the first link i put up. defender and symantec scans were performed and didn't catch it. 

issue: Hello, is there a support email or ticket system so I can keep track of the issue I have experienced' 
solution: 

issue: grahamperrin: on the email it only says: "Check out the example Welcome Message from our gitterHQ/gitter room.". BTW, I'm looking at this on the phone. 
solution: 

issue: j127: Haven't had that happen, personally, but I'm pretty sure that Gitter is self-contained with the exception of the start-on-login feature. Just remove it from the Startup items in Windows 8, and then trash the Gitter app itself atC:\Users\you\AppData\Local\Gitter. That's been my experience, yes. But if you think about it, there really is no difference between "remove" and "hide". (given that the conversation between you two is never deleted) Well, I'm not sure about "never", but you can't initiate any such deletion yourself (to my knowledge) 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] @j127See [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] @magaronovYou need to setup a standalone bot app that uses the [<-LINK->] through the bot user (just like any other user)  [<-LINK->] @Zoey76I have removed the GitHub association from the community and added you as an admin  [<-LINK->] @nofilenamedYou can track [<-ISSUE->]

issue: … app for mac: 1. whenever I open it, it loads, like if it would open the first time, …@MadLittleMods for what it's worth, I was glancing at the keychain aspect of https://github.com/gitterHQ/desktop/issues/183#issuecomment-284573322 benomatis: does the application not, or no longer, work with keychains? 
solution: 

issue: benomatis: We still distribute 1.x for macOS because we want to improve the auto-update process there before rolling it out. Whenever opening the app, loading is normal. The desktop app is the web app inside a desktop container  [<-LINK->] @TechievenaThe main Gitter app isn't open source yet 
solution: Zoey76: well, I guess one would need to make a survey and see how much a native app would be wanted among the userbase... probably a topic for further out in the future. 

issue: Whilst Free Code Camp does use the Gitter service for some things, I doubt thatGitter supportcan help with your Free Code Camp beta issue. You are – now – using Gitter apparently without difficulty. Please approach Free Code Camp for support. Thanks.

solution: rahmanoh: This room is for Gitter support. You probably want to be here [<-LINK->].  [<-LINK->] @DanielGGordonThreaded conversations. You can track [<-ISSUE->].  [<-LINK->] @joeweldsAre you behind a proxy/vpn? [<-ISSUE->]. 

issue: can anyone tell me how to get out of a never ending loop with windows Gitter? i click "Allow" and the integration is enabled in Gitter on the config page of the site, but it just minimizes the Gitter app when I click Allow MadLittleMods: nope. not behind a firewall or on a vpn. 
solution: 

issue: How do I change the default notification settings for rooms? Right now any time I join a room I have to remember to switch it. MadLittleMods: Thanks! I can't believe I missed that.

issue: We would like to create a chat roomhttp://gitter.im/xyz/xyzfor our private organisation/repositoryhttp://github.com/xyz/xyzbut get the error messageThis address is not available.I am owner of the organisation and repository. Any advice?  [<-LINK->] Yes. Both Public and Private Repo Access. Resolved. - I am in multiple orginisations and access was granted only for some of them. Not that clear from the user interface, see above. Thanks for the support. 
solution: 

issue: SellersC: hey, scroll up a handful of messages, please follow the link toOrientation for newcomers. awb715: no such plan, as far as I'm aware. Orientation for newcomers includes a link to a blog post about GitLab. MarcWeber: from:MarcWeber  [<-ISSUE->]  [<-ISSUE->] evol8hektve_twitter: I guess, [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: If not Github, then Twitter? 
solution: well gitter has twitter authentication but its just not as commonly used as email or facebook, so acquiring members wouldnt be as efficient. 

issue: btcmacroecon: Gitter just integrates with GH, we're not part of GH 
solution: . 

issue: Ask them to take it to a DM? It's not great, but I can't think of another way to isolate a specific conversation between 2 people. Perhaps a slack-style thread feature? 
solution: It's not between two people, unfortunately. And it's often relevant to the room.. 

issue: hey what does this mean  [<-LINK->] and how can I give permission for that I can't find anything about it anywhere my repo is not tied to any organisation it's just tied to my name or is that wrong? so can someone help me set up a gitter channel I can’t seem to do it :) :(* 
solution: 

issue: InternetUnexplorer: where is the orientation at? Obviously I'm also a newbie. 
solution: jarrod817: The orientation is [<-LINK->] .. InternetUnexplorer: just wants [<-ISSUE->] to be fixed, is that too much to ask?. 

issue: Can that not be made "more official"? 
solution: 

issue: Hello, can I get a redirect from [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->] (both) to [<-LINK->] (as previously discussed this 2 rooms has been created from noware removed GitHub repositories) from now removed* manselis: I do not understand what you mean. 
solution: 

issue: Hey yall, I want to add a hubot to my room but I can't register an application.  On this page]( [<-LINK->] I click the Register the application link and it does a redirect to the homepage (Sorry for the broken messages, seems like it automatically sends on mobile firefox if I navigate away) 
solution: 

issue: Hey boys and girls - Why don't you add a feature "List my question during the last 48 hours in a short overview so that I can jump back fast and check for replies?". Not having a well working search is bad. Or can I log to a file and search within that? 
solution: 

issue: This might sound like a dumb question how do I change my emoticon in gitter 
solution: 

issue: Hello Gitter heroes. A question: is there any way to get some historical stats on activity for a Gitter room? I see that I can go to the archives page and see a heatmap-like view - but I'd really like to be able to show the growth of our Gitter community over time Any easy way to see growth in users, growth in posts to our Gitter room? (We're getting tons of value from Gitter, by the way - our team uses it for the [<-LINK->] and I don't know what we'd do without it...) 
solution: 

issue: HeyIs their any room for android app development? I found one but dont know in which language they were talking Thanks@grahamperrin 
solution: 

issue: Why my Image is not showing? How can I edit my profile? grahamperrin: Now I am seeing generic Gitter Avatar 
solution: 

issue: @InternetUnexplorerFriendly reminder that when you search "FreeCodeCamp", the first result is gitterHQ/gitteri don't see that - where are you getting that? 
solution: I just tried it, too, and I don't see that, either. The official freecodecamp room is indeed first.. iamchetanp_twitter: twitter was returning a really odd response for your avatar, i've updated manually so should work now. 

issue: despite saying I only want emails related to threads I'm following (which should not be the only available option) and not actually following any threads I'm receiving almost 100 emails daily. I left the chat room and changed my settings again and still nothing. This is insanely annoying and there are literally NO options for just not receiving emails at all and the filters you do have don't work.  I don't even see a settings option for just leaving Gitter, this is ridiculous. 
solution: In other words, I'm confused as to why you can't click the Settings icon (the little slide-toggle thingy at top-right), click Notifications, click Configure Defaults (link at bottom of modal dialog), and uncheck the "Send me email notifications" box.. 

issue: so far i haven't found a way to contact anyone? why is there no option for just simply not getting any emails at all?  is there a way to just delete my gitter account completely? 
solution: There is such an option, but it sounds like you've already unchecked it. Something seems disconnected. Mike Bartlett is a staff-member, so you've already reached one.. 

issue: Okay, so I have conducted some testing with private rooms, with Graham Perrin being the tester. Now, talking from his name: Given a private room you're a member of, after you leave it, it's found neither in the list of all conversations, nor in search, which is normal. But a 404 appears after you successfully leave (This isn't the chat you're looking for, sorry!) and each time you try to enter the private room. It should be better to observe a plain English acknowledgement of departure. Moreover, I would prefer a forewarning that after departure from a private room I can't join it again. 
solution: 

issue: mydigitalself: What if you can't/don't want to log in using GitHub or Twitter but still want to chat on Gitter? That's how I understood it. 
solution: there's no option for that. 

issue: Create community in app is not working iPhone 
solution: jdmcwhinnie: What's it say?. You push and push but nothing. It's the create and finish button. 

issue: Hello, is there some iPad/Safari support for shift+enter/ctrl+enter for inserting lines in chatmode and sending the message in compose mode? Hello, is there some iPad/Safari support for shift+enter/ctrl+enter for inserting lines in chatmode and sending the message in compose mode?I submited this as a support question now. Thanks

issue: how can i  delete my account? 
solution: 

issue: hello.  ive sent a few messages on here and 2 emails to support and im getting no replies.  im getting hundreds of emails from freecodecamp yet im not actually in any of the groups.  im getting very annoyed and would like to delete my account.  Someone please help!  Thank you. yes i remember i sent this before that conversation was read and responded to.  all set, thank you for the help 
solution: 

issue: akroll222: i know how you feel, i've been getting a lot of e-mails as well. yet i didn't want tot delete my account entirely. so i set my preferences to not wanting to receive anything, and now i don't actually receive anything. cbj4074: i can imagine, i thought it be fun to part of such a community but the constant stream of e-mail drove me crazy to. really sucks if you can't turn it off. 
solution: 

issue: Reinoud-Zuyderhoff: He tried that but disabling does not seem to work.@mydigitalselfwas supposed to look into it... like a week ago. (sorry to name names, but I'd be pretty frustrated, too!) I think his case is a true anomaly. I turned it off and I don't receive any. And I've never heard anyone else say they can't turn it off. I suspect that he has two accounts or there is some weirdness behind the scenes. 
solution: 

issue: This is a test of the disappearing avatar bug Nope, doesn't occur in browser. 
solution: 

issue: @thebombzen Better to use https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/sandbox or your own private room^ ref for that issue, gitterHQ/gitter#1700

issue: akroll222: If you're on Windows, try opening Task Manager, click on the "Startup" tab, and disable the Gitter app there. 
solution: 

issue: Is there, currently, any difference between Current and Next? (Last I heard,chat-cachewas not recommended. That aside, I never noticed any difference.) 
solution: 

issue: mydigitalself: , hi,no my sidecar room is not private - im pretty sure. when you ask "did you specify in the javascript" are you saying i am able to specify in the script?.. i'll check it out. I basiclly just copied pasted the script from the sidecar gitter page. . . . once in the room, i entered the 'settings' and kept the "only github users" checkbox, unchecked.i thinking thats what open/not private means 
solution: 

issue: bhaugen: I would directly contact Gitter staff immediately. You can PM mydigitalself or madlittlemods, they are Gitter staff. That is probably the most direct way (also, thanks :)). 
solution: 

issue: Hi there, I'm a new gitter user that signed up through github. I kind of expected my name to be displayedYung-Jin (Joey) Hu #TheGhostHuCodes but as you can see above, it's displayed asThe Ghost Hu Codes @TheGhostHuCodes, does gitter cache the name somewhere and it's not getting refreshed? 
solution: 

issue: Hey Gitter should stop automatically submitting the image I'm uploading without my confirmation to the chat Drag / drop file and it posts to channel without me editing it first When I want to post an image, I want to get image markup first then edit and add it in my previous message 
solution: I repeat what you said in your first message, it shouldn't post image without my confirmation.It should do as in Github, paste image code, don't click "Comment / Post" button for me.

solution: 

issue: Where's the right place to ask questions on the iOS app? 
solution: 

issue: unsure if it's asked before, but is it possible to unify my gitter account here? i signed in with twitter and github.. little did i know it would be separate i thought the email would be the unique identifier nobody answered my question about gitter :/ 
solution: 

issue: How to link out out of python to my terminal and im using atom ? 
solution: 

issue: It appears that Gitter does not support issuing notifications onactivityin a given room, e.g. when stuff happens in the right-hand column, such as new commits or CI build breakages. Is this correct, or have I missed something? 
solution: You should get notifications in a given room. It’s working on my end@cbeams.

issue: @/developersI'm on my phone using the Gitter App. I'm trying to login to Gitter on my desktop using Github & instead of being logged in I'm receiving a 404 error message from Github. Windows on Firefox.

issue: PFCKrutonium_twitter: @PFCKrutoniumre: [<-LINK->] did you work around your GitHub authentication issue and if so, would you like to delete your unlisted video? 
solution: Off-topic from Gitter: I recently worked around aGitHubTwitter authentication issue affecting Diaspora – [<-LINK->] – by avoiding browser extensions. Firefox in my case.. I lack the technical knowledge, but I'm curious.@PFCKrutoniumcan you recall, did you delete cookies for both GitHubandGitter? In retrospect, I wonder whether attention to just one of the two sets might have worked around.. 

issue: MadLittleMods: thanks for coming back to me! I send the mail 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] @pawniI assume you mean communities (in Gitter terms). Those communities still exist as you can't delete a community. Click the "Add a room" button at the bottom of the conversation list to see it listed in the community dropdown. Can you give some more specific URLs? 
solution: 

issue: Is it possible to upload images the way Ghost does it, by adding empty![]()then uploading my image? Or, what is the best practice to share screenshots/etc ? Using some public image hosting service? 
solution: cpq: You can upload images by dragging them into Gitter, that's one way to do it.. I use ShareX, which takes a screenshot, uploads it to imgur, and then copies the link to my clipboard..

solution: That's by design I think.. Lilyheart: No problem, it happens :). 

issue: Oh wow.  I apologize.  I thought I was in my own chat room.  Not sure what happened there! 
solution: 

issue: Dids: you can't  remove activity unfortunately lolmaus: long story, but email notifications work a little differently from desktop ones. best to change your default toMute. You'll still get direct mentions but not@/allmentions. You can do this by going to Notification settings anywhere, then clicking on the default option at the bottom. it's not on the todo list at the moment, right now we're open sourcing gitter, then adding GitLab integration, so it's fallen behind the list of priorities until that work is done@lolmaus jimtryon: just explain a little more what you are seeing. 
solution: 

issue: Just builded and posted new release of GitterMobile – fully (almost) featured native mobile client for Android (and iOS). [<-LINK->] Give it a try and post some feedback.It's open source, so everyone can contribute to it, open issues and submit PRs.  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: cavapoo2_twitter: Not much difference. The desktop app is a Chromium instance (just a "wrapper"), so they are basically the same. 
solution: 

issue: How long does it  take for Gitter to be able to see a user's ogranisation membership after third party access for gitter has been approved and shows in the third party application access policy page of the organisation? I can't do anything, gitter claims it can's see my org, but everything is enabled according to github 
solution: 

issue: grahamperrin: @cbj4074I like@abhisekp's [<-LINK->] on that bug.Also, I feel embeds don't bother me as much as it used to.Not sure why; one or more of:the communities I frequent are aware and are careful to not link to embeds that often

issue: hey guys, I just started using gitter, I logged in with twitter first and downloaded the Mac OS X app, but then I found some rooms that required me to be logged in with github, so I logged out in the browser and logged back in with github, but I can't find how to logout of the desktop app to make my account a github account only or how to add my github account to the twitter login so it knows that I have a github account too Thanks!  I didn't realize there was a menu bar option, I was clicking on my picture on the main app, looking in the menu, and using the command-comma to look for something in the options.  Gitter n00b :-)

issue: Why I get this errors when I run Jest after adding RouterEffects to the application? [<-CODE->] Here is last commit after what I started to get this error: https://goo.gl/j46JfY. Here is effect file: https://goo.gl/JGpJCEYes I inject Router there. But why I get error? I have RouterModule in the CoreModule. I test a component from the DiaryModule. Here is how I configure the testing module: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] It was small text but expanded to my over9k mad faces :D MadLittleMods: any thoughts how to do this? Oh, if I remember correctly you are owner? What do you think is this feature useless or not? I am not sure it is a good idea to spam such messages as I did... 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] first: an upload button is highly appreciated second: the URL in this comment on the very bottom is in [] and through that not clickable thanks a lot for all your work, is there already a release date for the source code? oh fine, thanks ^-^ 
solution: 

issue: Is there a way to filter mentioned chat messages only? Or favouriting a message for reference? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] @teenmatchml_twitterI work at GitLab. Being an admin/moderator of a room doesn't have any direct monetary incentive 
solution:  [<-LINK->] @mrossetThere isn't a way to refresh the token in the UI. I have removed the token and you should be able to generate another one by going to [<-LINK->] again. 

issue: MadLittleMods: Still not open-sourced the Android app, i see. Rutwik28: This chat is for Gitteronly 
solution: 

issue: Hi ! Recently started using Gitter with both public and private chatroom. In the Android client I can not find any hint as to wether a chatroom is public or not Apparently a padlock is shown on the other client. Seems like an important oversight. Or am I missing something? Sure will try to do it later today. Thanks Reported the issue::// [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: hi there i like to receive notifications with the OCD, is this possible? hnn, seems like there is an issue here on Chrome, i enable the notification of the desktop OSD notification and do not receive them 
solution: This is cool though. 

issue: WaterYourRoots: Not on topic here; this room is for Gitter support only. 
solution: 

issue: Why did you ban my matrixbot? Unrelated links? 
solution: 

issue: um I looked around but couldnt find an answer.... how do I "univite" someone? I accidentally invited the wrong person..... thanks so they need to accept first, yes? ok, i appreciate your help, but I dont undertand. what does /remove mean? 
solution: 

issue: Databugecho: They're not a thing here. Perhaps you meant to ask in the FreeCodeCamp room? 
solution: 

issue: What is gitter? Can i get help in monetizing codes? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, how do I get rid of this stupid green tab at the top of my screen that says "NEXT"? It's extremely frustrating to have it constantly visible. 
solution:  [<-LINK->] @mariobehlingIt needs to be associated with the GitHub repo in order to create a room with that name. If it isn't appearing in the typeahead or auto-associating, you probably need to grant private repo scope on that org, [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Hi. I see blog posts about an open source version of gitter. However, I can't find any references to source code or downloads. Is that available anywhere? 
solution: 

issue: I'm having the opposite problem; there seems to be no way to compose a newline on Android. 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys, I did something stupid, by mistake i revoked gitter access to github and I lost access to a community. Is this by any means recoverable ? @MadLittleModsI did but i still can't do anything, the community no longer appears in my list Ok this is weird, I logged in from the mobile app and I can see it Thanks anyway 
solution: 

issue: what is the economic model of gitter? I can't find it anywhere. Is there any pro accounts or something? i suppose that money is needed for the servers for example.. nafg: thanks!!! 
solution: 

issue: luminosidade_twitter: they used to be their own company and charged for private rooms but then gitlab bought them and made it completely free. They plan to integrate it more with gitlab. 
solution: 

issue: I cannot paste an image into gitter from the macos app, is this a known issue? or is it me? 
solution: portenez: See [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Hi, there I have a question. My bitbucket events aren't being posted to my gitter community despite enabling the integration. Am I the only one having this issue? MadLittleMods: Thanks for the reference 
solution: 

issue: Help me:I today signed up on the web app using twitter. Now I can't find how to connect my github account too. Can't join many rooms as they allow only Github users. How do I connect github with my new gitter account? cbj4074: It will connect my github to this account if my github account has the same email id. Otherwise it will result in two separate gitter accounts. Am I right? 
solution: 

issue: ShubhamBadal_twitter: Sign out of Gitter, and this time, sign-in with your GitHub credentials. (not your Twitter credentials) 
solution: 

issue: @Janisku7 I don't have any further steps to try if you already ran through the instructions linked.Did it previously work? Did you just update Windows and now it is not working? We don't necessarily support the bleeding edge Windows insider builds that may have bugs 
solution: 

issue: Hey all. I can’t seem to figure out how to log out of the desktop version of gitter for macos. I’m trying to switch from my twitter to my github login. Help? 
solution: 

issue: The android app is lacking in a lot of features, and has several annoying bugs (such as messages automatically being posted when you rotate the screen/press the back button). Hopefully the source will be released soon so the community can work on it, as the Gitter team seems busy at the moment. 
solution: 

issue: MadLittleMods: Resolved. "Allow Private Repo Access" still did nothing but the "Github private access" button did open a new tab when I explicitly added gitter.im to allowed sites hm, actually, I'm still not seeing this organization under "my organizations" how do I fix that? 
solution: 

issue: Hi all. I'm in a bit of a weird situation at the moment, and can't find any solutions in the Gitter documentation.  Some time ago we started a Gitter room around a group Github user (SARSky). That worked fine until we converted that user to an org on Github (which removes it as a user to log in). Ideally we'd now like to start fresh with a Gitter room based on that org, but we can't access the old one any more, and would like to use the same name for the room. Any ideas? MadLittleMods: Thanks, that'd be great. I've changed org membership to public. We don't mind if all the messages are lost. 
solution: 

issue: How do you force a refresh of a profile picture on hover? the display and the hover avatar are out of sync MadLittleMods: I did that no luck, Im using github login MadLittleMods: Thanks must be my cache 
solution: 

issue: Gitter is installed in my Ubuntu 17.04 Its showing in my dashboard but It's not responding when clicked eragon996: solved it with deleting .config/Gitter folder 
solution: 

issue: I am having trouble with my desktop client on MacOS. It suddenly starts with an empty white window. Tried to delete the cache folders without result. What is the procedure to get it back to a working state, or is it a known issue? jmcmurry: how do you fix it, as the client in the browser works without problems, only the electron app stopped working :( >_< Ok, so it seems that opening gitter.im in safari times out on my machine for some reason... and that is why the "desktop" app fails MadLittleMods: Gitter version: Version 1.177 (1.177) 
solution: 

issue: Ugh! If you do the OAuth flow within the application, i have absolutely no reason to believe that you aren't stealing my credentials. The Mac OS app is useless to me 
solution: 

issue: Any one know why gitter 3.1.0 crash when exiting in Ubuntu 16.04? No crash reported when quitting from tray icon menu, weird! 
solution: 

issue: Guys, I'm having an issue with Gitter. I can't seem to figure out how to just send someone a private message. I searched for 'groups and people' and they didn't show up, but they show up when I attempt to add someone to a chat room and put in their username. 
solution: 

issue: how do I delete a community? or change its settings? I can't find any way to do that MadLittleMods: I would like the community to be calledmyprojectnotmygithuborg 
solution: 

issue: can I change an existing community github association? Thanks@MadLittleMods, I'll follow up with support. btw, maybe it's just me, but I find the settings icon not very intuitive. I see that icon normally associated with Filters, not Settings. A gear is more common for settings. Just my 2 cents :) 
solution: 

issue: Hi thereI highly appreciate that gitter is open source since it was aquired by gitlab! however, development seems to have stalled since some time (according to the latest commits in your gitlab repos). In particular, I was looking for a desktop app and once again was tricked by your advertising that you have a linux desktop app. unfortunately, it's not true, it's only an ubuntu (maybe debian) desktop app.  Could you give a small update about gitter's development status? and, I'd really appreciate a desktop app for fedora linux!many thanks. ?  [<-LINK->] already in march but I don't get your point of why repos should move to a different solution then. gitter still continues to work with github (and hopefully soon with gitlab but this is related to my question above) they did, but there is not much activity  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: maybe they have moved repos to gitlab, did you check it? 
solution: 

issue: I think GitHub is basically the de-facto best natural way to log into Gitter with the least restrictions. There's gitlab stuff going on, but it's historically been for discussion around GitHub projects, so you should have an account. Presumably twitter accounts include the__twitterthing to avoid the potential for conflicts, they added that avenue to provide a limited way for strangers to get into a (public) channel. 
solution: 

issue: Hello, is there a way to change the access token?+1, is there an issue for this? SISheogorath: That's been bugging me as well, check [<-LINK->] . 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys, are you planning to make the Gitter Windows app available through the Windows (10) Store? 
solution: 

issue: pydo:  [<-LINK->] @MadLittleMods [<-ISSUE->] is not in the Wayback Machine, can you tell what it was? Thanks. 
solution: 

issue: I'm currently testing the [<-LINK->] (creating .rpm packages for fedora) and was finally able to get an .rpm package. However, the gitter desktop-app won't start. Actually, even without going through the build process, running the development version vianpm start(following [<-LINK->] ) only gives me the following error:  [<-CODE->] what did I wrong? InternetUnexplorer:  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: silberzwiebel: Are you using Node.js 4.x? 
solution: 

issue: pydo: I figured out the relative change of address. Added it to the ticket. 
solution: 

issue: What is the latest version of the Glitter IM Client for Windows 3.1.0 I am on 
solution: 

issue: dloukadakis: two browsers, both set to notify, maybe? FWIW sometimes when I launch Firefox I get notifications for pages that are not yet open. 
solution: 

issue: is there a way to temporarily disable gitter notifications? can be distracting when they pop up during a meeting kadaan: well i'm on linux :D 
solution: 

issue: Does anyone know if there is a way for me to prevent my page to be scrolled straight to write a message in Gitter? I have a simple iframe. Every time I load the page it skips the top of the page straight to the chat room MadLittleMods: thank you! that's  a starting point. I will see if I can stop it from scrolling . 
solution: 

issue: Hmmm, I logged in again with GitHub, but it seems still to suffix with _twitter for me. Oh, no, it doesn't in this room. Another issue that resolved itself. 
solution: 

issue: how to refer everyone in a message? all: doesn't work 
solution: 

issue: Cyric263: Hello, what is your Gitter support question? Cyric263: There isn't an official one ( [<-ISSUE->] ), but you may be able to find an unofficial one somewhere. 
solution: 

issue:  October 30, 2017 4:58 PM @arian-swydo This was reported in August but I wasn't able to reproduce then (in the iOS simulator, scrolling horizontally worked fine but I had to scroll vertically outside of the code block).Mind creating an issue with some more details, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues 
solution: 

issue: Does anyone else have an issue with removing an app from Gitter developer? I get a 404. MadLittleMods: Thanks! 
solution: 

issue: MadLittleMods: is there a way to install Gitter on our own servers running linux? i cant see any docs for it InternetUnexplorer: i only see Mac Server instructions my server doesnt run docker - (at the moment) 
solution: will try and use the Mac docs as a guide and write *nix set for the community. 

issue: Is there a known bug with the OSX download for gitter.im? 
solution: When I download from gitter.im homepage - I double click the dmg and it mounts as 'Discord' and does not allow install. Though it shows the gitter logo, even though it says 'Discord'. 

issue: please make "mark all channels as read" menu item  [<-ISSUE->]  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: There is a per-process global limit of bfcache in Firefox which defaults to 50 pages. I'm not sure if container is counted separately, but it is possible the reason to inflect repro rate. That's interesting... 
solution: 

issue: docgunthrop: Dragging an image into your browser window will upload it to files.gitter.im Cyric263: Aside from deleting your messages, I don't think there is. 
solution: 

issue: When you setup a gitter.im chat room it remembers everything posted... is there a way to have it not remember everything? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] why can't create a community for an org? what does the error icon mean? 
solution: KillingJacky: Click "Next" to see the native form error tooltip. The community probably already exists. Yes, the community already exists. I finally managed to create the chat room directly with the “add a room” button.. 

issue: Hello -- just started a community for a project. So far, so good. Trying to create some rooms inside of it. Mostly works. But then I try to create a room with the name "topics" and it says "Validation error". Any ideas what the problem might be? MadLittleMods: That applies to all communities? 
solution: wviechtb: The name reservation applies to all communities but the topics feature itself has to be enabled manually by Gitter staff and is still in beta. 

issue: is there a gitter admin online? its important and urgent vrms: its not gitter related its a urgent matter concerning a member. its why I need an admin 
solution: 

issue: i'm having a problem with creating another chat room. posted here: [<-LINK->] Giess this room would have been better. I find it really hard to figure out how to allow/enable to make a chatroom for a github repo.I remember it was easier in the past and i think it ran into this issue repeatdly :/ i'm sry - but would be happy if somebody could help me out @MadLittleMods doesnt really help.I checked now: [<-CODE->] ...nothing helped This seems to be quite hard. :/ clearing the cache did not help either (I deleted all local data in Applications clear cache in the devtools + refresh hard reset) ...but no changes Am I the only one with this problem? MadLittleMods: both are there - so i can revoke both ... so i guess i already added both in the past MadLittleMods: it's not showing up MadLittleMods: the amigonia org is not showing up. i cannot select it 
solution: 

issue: IGBC: Pretty much. It was originally designed as chat for GitHub, but there are lots more integrations available nowadays.Also, there's an IRC bridge @ irc.gitter.im if you prefer using that :) 
solution: 

issue: notification settings do not work for me: I've set the overall deafult (and the same for every single room) to "Announcements: Notify me for mentions and announcements" but I'm still getting e-mails every second day or so for messages, I don't want to be notified. 
solution: 

issue: silberzwiebel: Emails are tied to unreads. Set your rooms to "Mute", see [<-LINK->] gracicot:  [<-LINK->] already exists on GitHub. Thekangarucommunity on GitHub would need to be associated with that org in order to be created That error is a guess that you may be the owner ofkangaruGitHub org and we just can't see it yet. But we should probably add another case where if you already associated a different GitHub entity, then we say you need to associate it with the proper GitHub entity. Feel free to create an issue, [<-LINK->] gracicot: Correct, you just need to change the URL gracicot: Thanks for the report, [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Ok, any plan to suppport that :) 
solution: amosbird: Not that I am aware of, but you could check the issue tracker to see if there is an existing issue. If not, feel free to open a new one :).. 

issue: I'm not aware of any such feature. Discord and others implement that, but not Gitter. Conversely, Gitter provides the ability to link to a specific message (byAlt-Clicking the timestamp to the right of the message). Now if only both platforms could do both things... singularity87: ^ 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] @karl-gustavSend a message tosupport@gitter.im  [<-LINK->] @singularity87See [<-LINK->] , MR welcome 
solution: 

issue: If the platform doesn't support said chain of accountability, you're being unreasonable,@hillct. I have no horse in this race, but if you're honestly asking this moderator to take time out of his day to copy/paste every comment he deletes (and I assure you, there aremany, and with good reason), that is an undue burden for somebody who vulunteers his or her time to clean-up the mess in here. If you'd like to take a crack at moderation, I'm sure there is an ear or two you can bend. 
solution: cbj4074: there are two possibilities. Either, as you say my credentials may have been compromized, or I simply typo’d sometihng posting in the wrong room. I don’t recall a message along the lines of what@InternetUnexplorerdescribes, but either way, if you’re going ot moderate something, it’s critical that you log the activity, so, first, you can demonstrate that the moderation action was taken appropriately, and second, if the poster were a repeat offender, more stringent action could be taken. It seems that Gitter had failed on both these counts. Certainly an area in need of improvement. 

issue: adridadou: Which version of macOS are you using? See [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] @gonzela2006The next time we have a release (no eta), [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] @RaiVaibhavCurrently, there isn't a good way to handle this. You can only hide a one to one room but it will re-appear whenever they other person chats. If someone is harassing you, feel free to send a message tosupport@gitter.imand we can take care of that user  [<-LINK->] @JustAnotherGYou can track [<-LINK->] You can't set a room buffer/limit. All messages are archived and accessible You can track [<-LINK->] for the dark theme issue with the roster count 
solution: 

issue: I'm having some usability issues with large code snippets If I try to paste code in a gitter message that's too large, I'm not only unable to send but even if I clear my message I can't send a message until I reload gitter Also if I link to a Gist and the Gist's preview is cut short, there's no visual indicator of this so it seems like the Gist is missing content Thanks for the link but I think I have an unrelated issue, the code snippet isn't overlapping with anything it's just not representing the full text of the gist Also not in safari 
solution: 

issue: Hi everyone, I think I discover a bug on your app and I would like to report, any devs here to talk? Ok I will talk here, I will share my problem So I usually like to code with some music, with Spotify. I have a keyboard with custom keys to pause, play, next music, etc. The problem is that when I was talking to another person and I wanted to pause the music, I clicked on the button and the app crashed. It crashes every single time. If I want to pause the music, I can't stay on Gitter, because it will crash. Hope you understand my problem and I would like someone to try and see if the problem is only mine or it's actually a bug. Thank you Gitter for Windows is what I am using Good to know this is already tracked, but it seems it is a bug from long time ago, and it's not fixed yet 
solution: 

issue: m4tr1k: That does sound like a legit bug, maybe submit a request ( [<-LINK->] As a workaround I would either just use Gitter in another browser windows or use your media keys to pause/unpause/etc spotify without switching apps 
solution: 

issue: Hey @rhunter, thanks for the report! Mind creating an issue to track it? https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues I pinged someone with admin access to the org to update the the image though.I wonder when this changed  It used to use the org avatar, https://github.com/gitterHQ Thanks :) Juanlu001: Like the article suggests, instead of removing all restrictions, you can instead "Manually grant access". Does that work for you? 
solution: 

issue: How can I send an image ? ok copy paste works, but I had no feedback that my image was indeed uploading, 10 seconds later you should add feedback that uploading started yet another example of a feature that was tested on high tier computer configuration but not the rest 
solution: 

issue: Hi there - I'm wanting to use glitter.im for an application but it is unlikely my users will have github accounts and not all will have twitter accounts.  Do you have other authentication options? 
solution: 

issue: fyi - a display prob with github issue display in gitter activity pane.I posted a "postcss-next"-related issue at github.  In appears in the ACTIVITY pane, as expected, at [<-LINK->] .However, the issue display on gitter fails to correctly parse/use the collapsible  "<display><summary>...</summary><display>" tags --  i.e., looks OK on github ; not on gitter. 
solution: 

issue: is there a way i can make the font bigger on the app on my computer? I searched and just get glitter or this chat 404 means that the site is down or they took it off so that site is no longer there XiaoCheng123: so that means you got the wrong site or they took it down ;) also if you click on the world you can search for freecodecamp/chinese@XiaoCheng123 Herrner: gitter does not respond i guess lol 
solution: 

issue: anyone can tell me why the Axure Components for element-ui has not found? for help it always can not be found 404 on github 
solution: 

issue: markandsbhatt: this room is for help with Gitter, not Xamarin. 
solution: 

issue: mariobehling: I wanted to delete my gitter account after I was disappointed by gitter. I am waiting now already since dec 28th for the support to delete my account. If they would allow users to delete accounts on their own, they would save a lot of manpower to respond to questions like yours. I expected this here to be a support chat, but no support member responded yet.

issue: Anyone else having an issue with the favorite button just not working at all? 
solution: unscene: I assume you are referring to the community home favourite button, see [<-LINK->].

solution: 

issue: Hello Gitter team, I recently created the Gitter community active_inference and am now trying to link it to my Github organization active-inference. I read through the FAQ but couldn't find how to do this. I was not ask whether I want to link the community to Github when I created it. 
solution: 

issue: @danijar There is a link "do you want to start a community for one of your github projects?" on the first page of the create community flow.There isn't a way to associate a community with a GitHub repo after the fact.

solution: 

issue: Just trying to use the IRC bridge at irc.gitter.im. It doesn't seem to be returning any channels when I /list (guessing that's a bad idea anyway, is there a convention?) and it keeps disconnecting me with a ping timeout of 78 seconds. Is it effectively down at the moment or is it a me error? It seems to be autojoining me to this channel/room but the disconnects are ongoing. Thanks for any pointers. I'll avoid spamming the channel and leave this as the last message on the subject unless anyone responds. 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] @TallTed_twitterWe suggest downloading the NW.js version of the app instead, [<-LINK->] (same root issue) You can track [<-LINK->] for font sizes No plans to make the sidebars resizable. They are collapsible though 
solution: 

issue: MadLittleMods: on FF, sometimes the styles just don't load and the UI becomes this cluttered mess where all images are rendered at full size. I had thought it was uBlock, but even after disabling that, it happens. It's RANDOMLY fixed itself again, so it's not happening now (with uBlock on). I'll try to give more specifics next time it happens. InternetUnexplorer: that's saddening to hear. what's kinda silly is that a simple 'fix' would be just to remove the auto-expand/auto-minimize on mouseover. it would make the search actually usable. you don't NEED to be able to view the entire comment in what should just be a preview, I could just click and go to the full comment. 
solution: 

issue: PatrickMassot: Alt-click on the timestamp does not work on Firefox on Ubuntu 17.10 -- brings up the taskbar menu instead

issue: I'm using the Gitter desktop app for Windows.  It plays an annoying sound literallyevery timesomeone sends a message.  How do I configure or disable this sound effect? To be clear, I don't want to disable notifications, just the sounds. 
solution: Looks like I've found a bug in Gitter. When I clicked on the TypeScript channel the URL updated and TypeScript was highlighted but I was still here. Hence the confusion. My brain ignored the header, associating it with the platform and not the channel.. 

issue: Hello! Is Android client source code available somewhere ? I would like to add dark theme to it 
solution: 

issue: Hehehe, true! Well, that's another issue; the fact that nobody on staff is monitoring this channel with relative frequency is a problem. 
solution: This reminds me ^, that's another problem with Gitter: the inability to see a link's destination (in the Desktop client, anyway).. 

issue: Okay I think we can all agree that miners and anything bad is not cool 
solution:  [<-LINK->] @MadLittleMods- That's not a context[ual] menu, that's the main app menu. Contextual menu is what comes when you right-click. Worth noting -- these sorts of settings don't generally belong in the main app menu, especially but not only on macOS where they break with the [<-LINK->] . Theymayreasonably be accessed through a dialog which is opened via a Preferences item in that main menu.. 

issue: Okay, if you want - create an issue on hackerone If not - i'll do it little bit later pascalwhoop: not glitter, there is "Disco" label  [<-LINK->] 
solution: Was the issue made private ( [<-LINK->] )?.

solution: 

issue: davesque: Gitter was bought by GitLab last year [<-LINK->] 
solution: i see.  so the gitlab folks are essentially responsible for maintaining it?. I guess it's still the team who made Gitter initially plus people from GitLab, as GitLab, from what I've read, wants to make an open source version..

solution: 

issue: Hi there, anyone knows the best way to send self-made gif on gitter? Those gifs might be hundreds of megabytes. So if I just upload it to imgur and send with![](link from imgur), it might take a long time to load. I noticed that other apps might convert gifs into short videos, because of compression. And play that video with nonstop loops. Actually there's no difference for user experience. I wonder whether there are similar mechanisms in Gitter As I finally convinced my friend to use Gitter as daily IM, however, they complained a lot that there's no elegant way to send animations. 
solution: 

issue: Hello - how do I change my avatar? I have read this topic https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/topics/topic/57f38458f56dd82733fb819e/why-hasnt-my-avatar-updated  and waited for these many days.Need help. Thank you. MadLittleMods: Thank you, I will drop a note tosupport@gitter.im

issue: Is there any news about this issue? [<-LINK->] It's a good 2 years old and I'm sick of getting emails for unread messages (so I turned emails off) At the very least, is it possible to update this help article to point at the issue on gitlab and not github? [<-LINK->]

issue: cbj4074: 
solution: @omerasif57 The best course of action is to Thumbs-Up the issue to which @MadLittleMods linked on GitLab, so it gains more attention.Gitter changed ownership in the past year, and code was not shipped for a while. The pipeline is open again, so up-voting issues is probably the best way to voice your request..

solution: not sure if you can login with GH on either Glip or Slack but it might be worth trying those ideas too or some other app that allows you to use GH as a login. 

issue: A lot of people have been reporting problems around messages not showing up lately in the rust-lang rooms — I also see it, only sometimes. Usually you have to click on the "unread messages" indicator to see the missing messages though sometimes messages fromsomepeople show up but not others (which can be quite confusing, if one of the missing people is talking to one of the not missing people) I can't see to find an issue on this, should I try to file one? it's hard to "reproduce" reliably MadLittleMods: still happening today definitely not so much to me, as by others though I did have it some unrelated,  but I also filed: [<-LINK->] since it took me a long while to figure out how to join this room in the first place :P filed [<-LINK->] it looks like I have that off though I'm not sure if that is reflecting the status of the app (vs the browser)

solution: 

issue: is gitter actually open source now huh 
solution: LWSS: The webapp and many other libraries are open source. We are still working towards getting other projects open source like the mobile apps. 

issue: MadLittleMods: No problem, it's great to see the production pipeline flowing again I do still need to open the one for the dark theme, I'll do that now, before I get distracted with work I notice too that:)isn't converted into an emoji since the change. Any reason for that? Maybe it's intentional. LDaVinciF_twitter: Yep, I agree that profile updates in SSO services, like Twitter or GitHub, don't seem to be reflected here immediately. The one I see for you is a dude holding a white cup... not sure if that is the old one or the new one. I have noticed in the past that not everybody sees the same one. Clearly, there is one or more levels of caching involved with this issue, and I'm not sure that it is within Gitter's control to "fix" the issue entirely. 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] @cbj4074It's intentional ( [<-LINK->] ), [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] @photisFor onlookers, here is the issue to track muting of users, [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] @LDaVinciF_twitterSee [<-LINK->] Veyhunk: I think so 
solution: Veyhunk: The decision was made before my time. I'll try asking someone who might know. My guess is that it was just a convention/trend to store all Gitter related things vs naming it the exact product name.

issue: Do you have any plan on providing a production level and gitlab integrated self-hosted installation vision?@MadLittleMods Got it, thank you so much. 
solution: 

issue: wengych_gitlab: What exactly do you need that's not already provided? If you are deploying in production you really have the following requirements:1) Install dockerized version in production mode2) Replace the Gitter home page with your own3) Do some edits to replace the GitHub login with your own SSO and disable the others4) Profit It uses passport.js so switching OAuth Providers is easy 
solution: 

issue: I've started using Gitter when it was still Github only. Now that it's added Gitlab as a log-in option, I'd like to use Gitlab instead, but I don't want to have to add each room I'm part of.

solution: 

issue: My top reason for using Gitter is for MathJax. This works well when typing from the browser UI. However, for reasons I don’t understand, MathJax does not parse when I type using the iOS app. From Safari: $$gitter \ To try again from Safari: $$gitter > iMessage$& i’m having a lot of typos, my apologies:gitter>iMessagegitter > iMessagegitter>iMessage From the iOS client now ...a>ba > ba>b Hmm. Well how aboutracxyrac{x}{y}racxy In the case of backslashes, the parsing is wrong. I tried using dfrac{x}{y} enclosed in double dollar signs.

issue: MadLittleMods: — New (I think) issue...  Go to a channel with a bunch of unreads, some of which include inlined media/includes.  Click the Unread ^ lozenge.  Channel scrolls to the first unread.  Then it expands inlined media, etc.  — and anything in the lower portion of scroll pushes the renderupinstead ofdown, so the first unread (which is no longer shaded as unread) is (a lot) suddenly offscreen up top, and getting there is not always easy. 
solution: 

issue: MadLittleMods: arghalso, when I click from room A to room B and back within (at least short and optimally configurable time, like 30 seconds minimum), the scroll in room A should REMAIN WHERE I LEFT IT

Can you provide a screenshot for reference?You can also try the unsigned v4.1.0 app (uses NW.js), http://update.gitter.im/osx/Gitter-4.1.0.dmg mapukhakis_twitter: You can link the screenshot here or drag and drop it onto the chat area to upload it mapukhakis_twitter: There aren't any plans really to update the v1.x of the app (uses Safari) so if it can't be fixed on your end, v4.1.0 would be your best bet 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] Hopefully you can see the font issue I describe. 
solution: 

issue: Ok- just upgraded. The font issue is still there. The left and right side panels both look fine though. 
solution: mklatsky: The right sidebar being fine is a little interesting as it is inside the same iframe as the chat. I was thinking it was a problem with any content in the iframe.

Scrolling back page-by-page isn't working either. (I'm running Gitter.app Version 4.1.0 (4.1.0) on macOS 10.10.)

issue: MadLittleMods: thanks! The links you just posted to GitLab issues point to GitHub (and return another 404, I'm not doing this on purpose) (strangely enough the notification email contains correct links to gitlab.com ) 
solution: steko_gitlab: What client are you using? I assume Android. This was brought up here  [<-LINK->] but it looks like an issue was never created. Mind creating an issue for GitLab issuable decorations opening in GitHub? [<-LINK->].

issue: My Gitter channel is quite quiet but I would like to let my team in other chat solutions be informed if there's an activity. But I don't want to constantly run a process on a server listening for the API. A simple webhook would be a better solution - whenver there's a message in my Gitter channel a POST request would go to a configured URL (AWS Lambda). Does Gitter support something like that? I couldn't find anything in the documentation. Thank you. MadLittleMods: That's interesting, 5 messages/day may be OK for most of the time but won't cover a conversation if there's a burst once in a while. I'm not ready to pay $50/month for a mostly idle pipe. I was looking for a solution that I could host in a pay-per-use cloud. But thank you anyway. 
solution: 

issue: okay great thanks InternetUnexplorer: they will be prevented on an IP basis from sending new messages? as ive already banned 5 of their accounts from my chat at this point so that isnt really stopping them 
solution: alexandred: To clarify: while I've been granted admin permissions in somegitterHQrooms to help with spam, I don't work for Gitter/Gitlab (just a community member), and so I'm afraid I can't do much to help.However,@MadLittleModsdoes work for Gitter/Gitlab and is fairly active here, so hopefully he can help you with this.. 

issue: pdurbin: That room seems to require authorized access or something. Also, if you use @ and then my username, I'll get a message that you replied to me I think.

issue: is it possible to block a user from PMing? this troll from yesterday is still persisting had to prevent new users from interacting with my github repo as he started spamming there lol in particular, the user vcreatyv has not yet been banned from the platform lets leave him unbanned from the platform for now, i'm trying to have a conversation with him as he is spamming my public facing emails too cbj4074: i run an OSS and he was getting very demanding with us helping him he wasnt happy that we werent holding his hand through the steps and he eventually just lost it 
solution: alexandred: For the time being, I would keep reporting the PMs until the Gitter admins can take care of it. I know it's not great, but it's better than nothing I suppose (as it alerts the Gitter admins).. 

issue: Hi everyone. Is there a way to archive an old inactive gitter room, so that people can't post there anymore, but the archives are still available? I don't want to delete the room, since the delete dialog box mentions that all messages will be deleted and we would like to keep the messages in the room as an archive. 
solution: 

issue: Huh. I tried to log in to GitLab to leave a comment on that issue but I can't log in anymore. I wonder if it's because I clicked on the "login with GitHub" button when I shouldn't have since I do have a GitLab account.

issue: Hey team, i've searched the documentation and can't seem to find how to block users from private messaging you. Is this a feature at the moment? He's not spamming in the channels much, it's just he's asking a lot of questions since i helped him with somethings but he's not really trying to solve his own problem and he keeps just dropping the code in that i send but not trying to understand it so it'll break and then he doesnt try to fix it Cool will do, thanks for the advice   :D

solution: 

issue: MadLittleMods: oh! not easy to find :) 
solution: 

issue: Sure. As I said in the issue. Gitter gets this right. 
solution: 

issue: mcarpenterjr: makes sense. I think of Mattermost as one of many extremely similar chat solutions. Gitter is different with its embrace of transparent communication. It pairs nicely with open source projects on GitHub or GitLab. I just submitted an idea for a talk about this: [<-LINK->] Is there a way to get a sense of which rooms on Gitter are somewhat active? Is there an issue I can track for what I want? "Trending" or whatever you want to call it? Signs of life. Bookmarked. Thanks. I'd be fine with just a nightly JSON dump of the top 100 most active rooms from the past day. Not sure how hard that query would be. Number of messages per room for the past 24 hours. If that query were run right now, what would be the count of messages in the past 24 hours for the room that's 100th on the list? 10 messages? 100? 1000?

issue: Am I missing something with the mobile app.  I don’t remember what I logged into it with, but whatever it was, it doesn’t appear to be synced with the account that I signed on with from my computer

issue: So I am on seperate profiles... Not that I can't just resign in from the computer but there's not a way to do it on mobile 
solution: 

issue: MadLittleMods: ok i see it.  I'm on ios.  You can't just make that setting to where it could stay on or off?  Still I don't really need it, I only created a second account because I forgot about the first.

issue: hi, Does the from:username search need any special syntax to find my username? for example from:MadLittleMods works, from:AdmiralSnyder doesnt. Or does it simply not work with the own username? from:me doesn't work either. How do I see all my posts? 
solution: AdmiralSnyder: from:AdmiralSnyderworks for me here. Search only looks for messages in the current room. You could be running into [<-ISSUE->]. 

issue: does from:MadLittleMods work for you? 
solution: 

issue: So I can't prevent people from seeing my presence then? is that the case also when I use the irc gateway? 
solution: 

issue: @nolash If the room is public you could view the room while being signed outThe IRC gateway marks any message that passes through it as readby you, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/irc-bridge/blob/4be376c6d58be55683abec0b099f89d2a653a215/lib/gitter-adapter.js#L196 
solution: More human is giving each other the freedom of what they want to reveal@hazho. But I doubt anything  fruitful will come out of continuing such a discourse here.. @UnfamoseHKR666 @nolash It's less of a case of forcing and more that lurking is gone now.

solution: 

issue: Is there some way to change name and avatar? thepublicone I mean issue is that github has not messaging, so it is not susceptible to certain kinds of attacks but gitter is basically nothing but messaging, the entropy is higher and you are exposed to more attackers. so we really need a ghosting layer

solution: 

issue: Can anyone point me to a doc about language-specific formatting in  back tick  fences?gitter seems to partly support specifying a language (as github/gitlab do) but even with no language, it still adds colors in a way which is almost-but-not-quite javascript. 
solution: pedro-w: If no language is specified, it will try to auto-detect. You can usetextif you don't want any syntax highlighting. You can manually specifyjsif you want JavaScript (or any other language).

solution: 

issue: Thanks@TallTed, I was thinking you were referring to the archive overview page that shows the year heatmap @pedro-w You can edit a message to be blank and it will show as deleted with a message indicating it was.

I am expecting that I get an email notification when someone posts a message directly to me. But it has not worked until now.

issue: Hiya, seem to be having some issues with@matrixbotagain. I suspect it was a side effect of us starting the bot, but it can't send messages to gitter anymore. Requests seem to succeed but do not appear on gitter. I guess it's banned/ *?

issue: Half-Shot: matrixbotwas banned and probably picked up in our spam detection for sending the same message over and over. I have unbannedmatrixbot 
solution: 

issue: Has anyone else noticed that Alt-clicking timestamps to insert links into the chat input field stops working periodically? Restarting the Gitter client (I'm using the desktop client) fixes the issue. I'll check the Console next time and see if an error is generated when it fails to work correctly. 
solution: cbj4074: I've experienced that but thought it just may be a long-running process borked alt on Chrome/Windows bug. Mind creating an issue so we can start tracking it? [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Hi there! I seem to have lost access to a room that I should have access to for my github org. Is someone behind-the-scenes at gitter able to help?

I see no place to log out or look at profile. This is the iOS app for Gitter. Yeah, it doesn't seem to tell me what your username is so I can tag you. So I CAN'T tag you is what I meant Ok. Thank you!

solution: 

issue: I updated my profile pic on gitlab and I see the updated image in the chat pane (the updated one has a purple background) but in the top right (account section) I see the old image still (the old one has an orange background). Has gitter cached the old image? Will it ever update? It's really bugging me. Also when I click my pic in the chat pane, the popup has the old image in it. Anyone else seeing this for me? Where I said gitlab I meant github MadLittleMods:  [<-LINK->] This is what I see, I have tried logging out logging in, deleting and recreating account etc... why thank you ;) I recon it must just be a caching issue, I imagine that it will all sort itself out over time 
solution: 

issue: FWIW, I see your other avatar,@neilathomson:) 
solution: It has changed since yesterday however, profile image in the top right of Gitter is now showing the new profile pic, yesterday it showed the old one. It definitely is, I've seen it many times. It always works itself out within a day or two, in my experience.. 

issue: Very good work guys 
solution: 

issue: Hackathon on Mon-Tue. But on Tue I'll be at this: [<-LINK->] 
solution: I work full-time, so weekdays are tough, but if I plan in advance, I might be able to catch these events in a future iteration. Looks like just the type of thing I'd be interested in.. 

issue: Where do I update my profile? MadLittleMods: What are we using from GitLab in our Gitter profile? We have aBioon GitLab, but I'm not seeing that in my Gitter profile. Do we only useFull namefrom the GitLab data? 
solution: 

issue: Hello, one more suggestion for gitter feature. The search can be more intuitive if it is provided in the chat room itself. Right now the search gives results from all chat rooms. sometimes yes. As I know there had been discussion about something in a particular chat room that I want to share 
solution: Have you checked the issue tracker to see if anyone else has asked for this?. 

issue: It looks the Bitbucket integration is now (temporarily?) broken. Can anybody confirm this? MadLittleMods: I cannot determine whether it is a server-side issue or not with my limited knowledge. But I got a server error when I tried to set up a new integration in a chat room after getting authorization from Bitbucket. MadLittleMods: I am now failing to reproduce the problem.  I cannot open the integrations window. I will recheck my problem and come back. 
solution: MadLittleMods: is it the wanted behavior of the last entry of the activity sidebar list to be hidden after the right-toolbar-footer-region ? Wanted to open an issue but probably this is the expected behaviour so there would be no need for an issue.Hopefully you can clarify.. schwedenmut_gitlab: : I wouldn't say that it's the ideal UX, but it was probably deemed good enough for releasing (my assumption) since it hides the oldest item in the list. Feel free to create an issue because it would be better to see all the items in the panel. Workaround of sorts is to zoom the page out usingCtrl+-till you can see all items. 

issue: Hey people of gitter Just me again, with a quick question, should [<-LINK->] be displaying a 418 (I know about the RFC, but I'm confused) (I was looking for my settings and can't find them) 
solution: 

issue: viktomas: thanks for the reply. Created an issue right away 
solution: 

issue: Just out of curiosity, mac os app is still officially stuck at 1.177 I am using some inofficial build that@MadLittleModspointed me to. Why don't we have a newer release yet? Also is there a newer build than 4.1.0? As this version despite beingmuchbetter than 1.177 is still fairly glitchy and I was hoping to be able to update. MadLittleMods: that was true over a year ago no? And I had a ton of issues with 1.177 not updating posts. I hear that from my communities a lot. I have to keep telling people to use the 4.1.0 that has it's own set of issues. Like having to double click on the side bar to get to a channel and stuff like that. But at least one is able to always post with 4.1.0 and receive all messages. Now one of my channels can't update it's avatar in 4.1.0 what made me look if there is an updated version by any chance and I was very surprised to see that 1.177 is still the offical version. Anyways, thanks for letting me know@MadLittleMods

issue: @esden There is this issue for Matrix, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1684And there are some 3rd party alternative apps listed on https://gitter.im/apps 
solution: 

issue: Hi everyone. I just downloaded Gitter but it's starting up with my Windows every single reboot. Is there a menu I can navigate to do disable auto-startup? MadLittleMods: Wow I didn't even see that menu bar. I was using msconfig to disable and it kept coming back. Thank you! 
solution: 

issue: Well said@nileshtrivedi. Community support is a huge use-case. One could conceivably run a Gardening Club that chats on Gitter... plenty of non-development-related use-cases out there.

issue: We just renamed a github repository (GMLC-TDC/HELICS-src -> GMLC-TDC/HELICS) a few hours ago -- is the gitter room url associated with it going to stay the same, or will it at some point update to reflect the renaming on GitHub? Thanks -- was finding a lot of outdated info (~2014) elsewhere

issue: taburetkin: Thanks, [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: yes, i noticed that this room is linked with gitlab's issues.suddenly gitlab takes my name instead of nick :-/. Hmm, but there is still an unread indicator for this channel in the Dock icon.. 

issue: thank you. yeah, sorry about that :-) i'll try again then 
solution: 

issue: behrangsa: good catch. Is there an open issue about this? 
solution: 

issue: Hello. I'm very new to Gitter so bear with me. I can't add integrations today into any rooms. When I try, I get a pop up message "Gitter. Something's gone wrong. Sorry". And that is it. I tried in both Chrome and Firefox but no luck. Anyone else? MadLittleMods: Thanks so much Eric! MadLittleMods: - yep all working for me now. Thanks for addressing it so quickly!

issue: I'm guessing that doesn't work in the desktop app? 
solution: 

issue: i get a lot of email notifications on channels i put on only on mentioning 
solution: 

issue: Hi everyone, do you guys get gitter notification alerts on android. I just installed the gitter app and the notifications seem not to work. :( anything I am missing; does anything needs to be enabled on android? 
solution: 

issue: They sometimes work for me. I haven't been able to figure out a pattern. 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] @kvthmSee [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] @SudharakaP@pdurbinProbably this issue [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: Maybe, but that issue is only a month old. I don't know. Maybe it's fine. I haven't though hard about it. Between the Android app and the desktop app on Mac and Linux, I think I'm getting most notifications. I never use the website.. pdurbin: Some docs, [<-LINK->]. Right. This doc has my favorite line in it: "If you are using the IRC bridge, it will mark every message as read". The IRC bridge is actually what I use the most often. I love it. :). 

issue: I've tried searching for this via both bing and google, and read the documentation (I think pretty thoroughly), with no luck, so hopefully I'll be forgiven if this is one of those "asked and answered a million times" question - is there a way to see a list of my favorite rooms? Communities are nicely discoverable via their docking on the left menu, but rooms I can't find - and if I've left one of my favorite rooms the only way to find it is to "re-discover" it via search or some other non-intuitive (to me) methodology. 
solution: 

issue: LemonAndroid: LemonAndroid_twitterhas been unbanned igalic: Issue is still valid. Dark theme works for the rest but not the chat igalic: To clarify, the related merge requests section just shows any merge request that mentions that issue number. Not necessarily a merge request that solves the issue 
solution: 

issue: i see the related merge requests here are merged, [<-ISSUE->] so, what about the issue itself? just gonna sign up for the beta, and hope for the best 
solution: 

issue: I'm using the desktop client on Ubuntu 19.04. If I close the  main window there doesn't appear to be a way to restore it. The notification area icon has sign out and exit options only. If I click the launcher again nothing appears to happen. I did look through the issues in GiHub but couldn't find anything relevant. MadLittleMods: Thanks a lot. Turns out I hadn't joined any rooms so the menu didn't display anything. Minor issue I suppose. 
solution: 

issue: Why does gitter only sometimes format messages in dart that seem roughly like dart syntax highlighting? Or is it really just guessing, and thinks it's json or something. Ah, I could have sworn I tried that, maybe I assumed it didn't actually change things.  [<-CODE->] Thank you! 
solution: 

issue: Oops, wrong chan, sorry. Can you get a channel to always guess one language, if delimiters do not specify a language? The users on flutter/flutter have a hard enough time understanding how to wrap with ```. Maybe the docs could be made to beeven easier. For example, assume many of them don't speak a lot of english. Oh, I might have been told that, sorry. Thank you. So I've been asking people to not use the[blah](http://blah)feature because Gitter.app has no tooltip on hover. I'll check if there's an existing issue. Can't tell if this is the same. [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: I've been using gitter in Firefox running under windows and under macos. I am finding that the windows one doesn't open on the last read message whereas macos does. e.g. I am a member of [<-LINK->] and on windows it always starts on 13th July. Any reason why that might be? I've tried deleting all gitter's cookies from Windows Firefox and logging in again. Looked for issues but not sure what to search for... 
solution: 

issue: pedro-w: ok, let us know if anything. I'm glad I could help. As a side note, I meant logging in to the private tab without extensions. The private tab has the advantage of not havinganystate from your "normal" tabs, not just cookies, but local storage and other stores as well. :) have a great day 
solution: 

issue: Someone is puncutating sentences like this .Despite repeated explanation of how it works .I'm trying to resist asking them if they're trolling .Not sure what to do . When I asked Github to moderate on someone talking about "forced diversity" ,they said they'd monitor the account ,but to ask Gitter moderators to look since they're closer to the issue I suspect they are trolling .Any advice ? I wonder if they're using a right-to-left device or something.

issue: MadLittleMods: So, I changed the webhook on repl.it to use [<-LINK->] - but I did not receive any notifications on the gitter room I triggered the same event which got received at [<-LINK->] MadLittleMods: could repl.it be added as a "standard" service - so it is more easier to integrate? Why doesn't the Custom integration not work with repl.it? 
solution: 

issue: @kgashok When creating Custom Gitter Integration, I can see in the instructions:Accepts form or JSON encoded messages to display in the activity feed.message (required): the message that you want to be displayed (in markdown).

solution: 

issue: eliotb_gitlab: IIRC, the issue is that your gitlab and github identity are treated as two entirely separate accounts, so you won't see the subscriptions you made on one if you're on the other. 
solution: 

issue: Hi there. The mobile Website seems to be broken. The button which should open the list of rooms/conversations is missing. At least on chrome and edge. Haven't tested more browsers. There was a menu button in the upper left corner before. Now that i know i have to swipe I don't need a button. The main issue with this change is that you have to know it and it's not really obvious. Don't know how you could make it more obvious. 
solution: 

issue: Can I use compose mode in gitter  app 
solution: Hax4us: I assume it was for simplicity reasons. Submitting the messageCtrl+Enterwouldn't be possible on mobile device so there would have to be a UX treatment that would complicate the interface.. 

issue: Hi All. My Avatar did not update. I am signed in with my Gitlab and changed the Avatar to a pic a while ago and it did not update yet. I did sign in and out. 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys, do you know if there is a way to add a message to a git commit from gitter chat? it would be useful for us to keep aligned gitter conversations and git messages. MadLittleMods: thanks Eric!, but what I wanted is to add my gitter message to a commit at github.com directly from gitter chatroom. Is that possible? MadLittleMods: Thanks, I will do so then :) it would be very welcome just to keep aligned github/gitlab comments with gitter conversations and btw, do you know if it is possible to sign up gitter using just an email address? instead of using OAuth with github, gitlab or twitter? 
solution: 

issue: Hi gitter folks, are there any plans to do work on the Android client? And if you are, is there a place where one can contribute with issues and feedback 
solution: 

issue: Oh ok, I see. well if i understand [<-LINK->] right, main focus of the gitter-team lies on the webapp. but from my experience with the android client, they are very happy about bugfixes/improvements from the community side MadLittleMods: while the right toolbar state (pinned) persists, the left menu is always expanded after reload/revisiting gitter. What is the wanted behaviour?I would expect that the toolbar state persists on both sides.

issue: I have embedded Giiter on our site. It works well for external users but has problems when accessed within internal network/VPN. I get a certificate error while accessing even the Gitter site.

solution: 

issue: Whenever I search in Google for a string to look for previous discussion, Google gives me good results, and I click on the link. But the place in the room/thread I land on is not what Google summarised, and a quick scroll / browser page search doesn't return my string. Gitter search is all but unusable too as it returns an awkward all-time list of results in no order of relevance. In the case of code blocks the whole post is squeezed in to the search sidebar, unformatted. So if you're searching for example, an error log you have no hope of finding what you want with any context.

issue: Is there a video tutorial or manual on getting started with using Gitter? 
solution: 

issue: word of advice - the most confusing aspect of MS Teams is that in the team page, the conversations are threaded by default this leads to there being N conversations where N is the number of replies before somethiung inevitably says “stop starting new converstaionts, use the reply button" honestly, MS Teams is bewildering, but that one as a UX is terrible. getting threaded convestaions right in real-time chat is a serious challenge :) 
solution: i always thought that the intuitive way would be that if you@-mentionsomeone at the start of a post, it automatically makes that a “reply” to that person’s last message (which might be part of a thread). I suspect that in practice it’s a billion times more complex (like 2 people @ meting tha same person etc. etc.) but it would be dead nice if the work flow didn’t involve a mouse. just my 2p. 

issue: Ah, okay, thanks. It's a shame that the display name can't be different in gitter from the gitlab settings.

Oddly enough I was getting vibrations & sounds that I didn't know where they were coming from cause I didn't get any banners, but from the looks of it it was from Gitter. As in it sent my phone sounds and badges but not banners MadLittleMods: try one more, I was in the app and didn't hear anything (might be worth a separate issue, in-app notifications ) I'm actually seeing a different issue at this very moment, I'm not seeing the messages I've sent just now

issue: hello! interesting little situation I seem to have created for myself: I was attempting to add an org-level github integration to a room, but I mistakenly authorized the integration via the automatic method.

issue: I am experiencing issues with the gitter app. Many rooms / conversations don't show the input area at the bottom of the screen. I can't send messages, only see what is there already. Is there a problem? Now it's working again, would appreciate your view on the problem though. MadLittleMods: I use the android app and the desktop on win10. Desktop no problems but the app wasn't showing the input area at times yesterday. Was also random when switching between channels, sometimes it showed sometimes not. Seems fine now. Thanks for getting back to me.

issue: When I signed in using GitHub, I was asked if I wanted to authorize my organization.  I did not do so.  However, the OAuth scopes said that you'd be able to read my organization membership, etc.  So I'm confused about the access you have, now?  Could you please clarify? yes, it looks like it does provide access to my org.  That's not okay.  I need to revoke that OAuth grant.  I assume that deleting my account would do so?

(I'm trying to convince my open source group to move over from Slack, and this will be one of the pain points.) also, apparently message threading is available in iOS v4.4.0, but I don't know how to use it. oh, it looks like the apps are being deprecated.

solution: We're looking to add some community links to gitter from our assorted webpages, and are wondering if gitter provides any assets that we can use, or has guidelines on creating our own image using the four lined icon, possibly with customization to match our colors. I looked to the sidecar project to see if there were any ideas there (we don't really want a sidecar on the page itself, but hoped there might be good icons there), but that seems to be down right now, and it isn't clear to me where I could find a better source of icons and a "name/brand usage policy" to make sure we are respecting gitter's property.

issue: woo hoo. No more core dump with this build! The only issue I see is a weird white bar that doesn't respect the dark themes:  [<-LINK->] v 5.0.0 has this whitebar that doesn't respect dark theme setting. Is this expected? or a known bug? 
solution: 

issue: cognifloyd: This is expected. Just the custom menubar that's part of the app and doesn't have any awareness of the dark theme yet. Here is the relevant code if you're interested in fixing it or feel free to [<-LINK->] : [<-CODE->] SQL-MisterMagoo: The slow startup is because it has to unpack/unzip everything in the app before it starts up.
