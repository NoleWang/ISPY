issue:  [<-CODE->] 
solution: I keep an eye on this channel from time to time, but rarely have time for chatting.. 

issue: laco0416:  [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: ericmartinezr: check out my hacked together class based route config [<-LINK->]. 

issue: there isn't a.just()in Rx5  [<-LINK->] note that that's different to reactive-extensions/rxjs Observable.of(1) is the same thing 
solution: Check out this [<-LINK->]. This is the documentation for RxJS 5. Got it. This'll now replace the tab I've had open for the past 30 days. 

issue: Shouldn'tDynamicComponentLoader#loadIntoLocationactually add it into the location specified? It's adding it after the<div #child></div> [<-LINK->] 
solution: gionkunz: so how could i add it inside the div? Also. Is it possible to render a component without it's root selector element? Similar toreplace: truein Angular1. gaiottino: ,replaceis deprecated in angular 1.x  and is considered a bad practice as it brings a whole lot of problems, also it doesn't play with the concept of shadow DOM where you have a host element and a shadow root. 

issue: Will there be a material stuff for angular 2? 
solution: Currently I am using [<-LINK->] . I wonder if I am going the right path (for now; timeframe; etc).. 

issue: Has anyone run into a situation where ng2 instantiates a component despite it appearing not to match the specified selector? 
solution: justindujardin: no.. are you sure it doesn't match the selector? It most likely does. I’ve checked a bunch of times, it should not be matching as far as I can tell.. 

issue: Who hereplans on writing all their angular 2 apps in pure ES6 instead of typescript ? 
solution: seanpar203: the biggest issue in using pure JS at this point, is most documentation, tutorials and resources are written in Typescript, so unless you want to read source code all day, you'll have a much easier time using Typescript. Also, as javascript is still valid typescript, you don't have to fully understand typescript to be able to get along. At this point, I'd say it's way easier to program Angular in Typescript than pure JS just because of the limited resources you'd have available.. 

issue: Do you want the same item in all components? 
solution: I need to just filter one object from the many. but, I do not know where I can put the code, In the .map or where, I would like to just return a single object from the service. 

issue: has anyone read this article  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys, I'm trying to set a property in my component after it's been loaded. But everywhere I try to do it messes with change detection any tips? Here's a gist with the code, if anyone can have a quick look: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: :-D 
solution: 

issue: hi trying to read ng-book2 reached the chapter of observables RxJS seem very complicated as I dont have any experience with Reactive Programming any good tutorial that I can use of ? 
solution: @pantonis I have these in my bookmarksThe introduction to Reactive Programming you've been missinghttps://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754Reactive Extensions APIhttps://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/tree/master/docInteractive diagrams of Rx Observableshttp://rxmarbles.com/. @pantonis but for basic stuff that'd you do when using Angular, instead of .then, you use .subscribe ... and unlike angular 1, the request isn't started until you subscribe (which would be the equivalent of it not starting until you hit the then statement.) Once you get that, you can do most of the basic stuff.Also has some neat stuff when you can subscribe to certain controls value changes...which would basically work like an event emitter. So if you have a input box control, you can just ... this.texbox.valueChanges.subscribe() and be able to set variables or run functions then...Those two are the basic use cases you'll need to know. Other stuff may need to dig a bit deeper, but it's not overly complicated as it seems once you dig in for most basic stuff. 

issue: I have an array of observables - how I can find moment when all of them will be completed? 
solution: ericmartinezr: Would this be the way to do it? [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Hello, I why are my changes not reflected on the page? It only works once after i run the npm start command 
solution: 

issue: any1 knows how to use localStorage or cookies? 
solution: bolota: : Mozilla also has decent guides on many JS topics including [<-LINK->]. ouch, seems caught exceptions include hundreds of random Jade exceptions x_x, not sure how to get through that to the real ones.... 

issue: What's the most recent best estimate for a release date on Angular v2 - anyone have any idea? 
solution: tkambler: they add a week everytime someone asks!. 

issue: do you get autocomplete in vscode? 
solution: I have something similar to what@d4nc3ris doingimport * as moment_node from 'moment';. 

issue: Hi, I'm following tutorials from angular.io and I have (maybe weird) question. Can I configure building anyhow that I don't have all .js and .ts files in the same folder next to each other? That is causing quite a mess. When I move it somewhere else I have problems with SystemJS tho :( 
solution: @dsebastien in regards to the generator modern web-dev, take a look at https://github.com/angular-fullstack/generator-angular-fullstack if you haven't already. I couldn't find something like what you created that also offered backend support. Here is a few things that would be really helpful1) The backend to use something like koajs2) Support for role based access control3) Some base level components like a topbar, and left menu like the angular material left menu. 

issue: I have been using backends like Umbraco and SiteCore and ASP.NET, so most of the translations come from there, I never needed a client side tranlation lib or tool ... 
solution: 

issue: and what if your client has no JS? 
solution: most of the solutions we build were able to run without angular … or any js. so we could not rely on a client side lib to do the translations .... Right... if your client has no JS, then Angular wouldnt work either. 

issue: any idea why this [<-LINK->] / [<-LINK->] is not being updated? [<-LINK->] 
solution: fxck: I see that you addedchangeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPushtoo, you may want to try addingChangeDetectorRef#markForCheckas well. fxck: can you make a plnkr?  Is the parent cmp OnPush too?. 

issue: um, how can I work with values from@Inputin constuctor? 
solution: apparently it's still an empty object in ngOnInit. 

issue: what module should i use for TypeScript? commonjs or system? Whats the difference? 
solution: 

issue: how can I change the element using if/else? [<-CODE->] 
solution: In your case they are two separate *ngIfs whereas using a switch ties them together. 

issue: Trying to come up with a generic pattern validation directive since none is built in, but running into an issue of only getting the string name of the variable passed to the directive instead of the variable itself... any ideas? [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: They released beta 1? 
solution: rolandjitsu: hard to tell what it is since the minification isn't showing the provider, but seems like one of your services must be getting lost in the minification... probably can just enable/disable until you see the break. 

issue: Is there a suggested way to try out angular material 2.  Is it to include [<-LINK->] ? 
solution: 

issue: is there something likePromise.allfor Observables? Or whats the best way to wait for two observables? 
solution: seems like that ng2 one is missing a great deal of components.... 

issue: One question, probably appeared numerous times here,  how to flatten array with observables? [<-CODE->] 
solution: vladotesanovic: this is a good guide which talk about flatMap and switchMap and is only a couple of days old [<-LINK->]. 

issue: thanks 
solution: 

issue: Help solve the problem, ngFor and jquery don't work: [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: sk-iv: http.get is async so ngFor is rendered after onInit.. gaiottino: I use jQuery plug-in isotope. Plug-in to each element adds a different style depending on the location of the element. With ngFor it does not work. ngAfterContentChecked() don't solve the problem of connectivity Isotope. Example: [<-LINK->] What could be the reason?. 

issue: How do I pass the router from a parent to a child component? 
solution: You\'d just need to include the RouterLink directive in your child component. and then use<a [routerLink]="[\'/childARouteName\']"> Child A </a>. 

issue: If I have a ControlGroup, how can I programatically set a control value soform.valueChanges.subscribetriggers? This is for a Jasmine test. 
solution: Nevermind, I found out what was going on - I was providing it in each component instead of just once, higher in the structure. gaiottino: get a reference to the actual control, then useupdateValue. to get a reference to your control, you have multiple options. I like this syntaxthis.form.controls['controlName'].updateValue('abc'). gaiottino: btw, you might need to cast it:(<Control>this.form.controls['rememberMe']).updateValue('abc');. 

issue: is there an NG2 gitter? 
solution: christopherthielen: this is the only thing I've found [<-LINK->]. christopherthielen: is this what you're looking for? [<-LINK->] , note thatprovidersis optional too. 

issue: Can someone refresh my mind by explaining to me the difference between[ngIf]and *ngIf? It had to do something with templates? 
solution: I have personally used that, but that\'s not to say it\'s the preferred way. Anyway, to me it\'s the most clear of the three. Using it hidden inside "template" attribute seems to be like hiding the existence of the condition. So yes, I would use the *ngIf without extra tags. Less is more.. 

issue: I haven't really used unsubscribe yet...for most one and done server request, should we call it? 
solution: 

issue: What am I doing wrong when[hidden]="expr"works but not*ngIf="!expr"? 
solution: 

issue: Does anyone know how to import or require a node module  from any ts file? 
solution: LuigiFrattolillo: i wouldn’t use require unless you know for sure you are compiling to commonJS, currently the demos from angular.io are confiogured to run using systemJS and the compiled code does not use require(). 

issue: I'm sure this has been asked plenty before but..... I am a bit of a Javascript and Angular 1.x novice now looking to move to Angular2, do I go with Typescript or Javascript? taking the steep learning curve from v1 - v2 of course 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] npm install fails for me on Mac OS. tried a few versions of npm now 
solution: 

issue: displague: note you can justimport {Observable} from 'rxjs/Rx' and get all the operators qdouble: what? also whoever asked [<-CODE->] 
solution: robwormald: is there a way to replaythis.http.get('users')(so you could justthis.users.replay()) or do you usethis.users.switchMap(this.http.get('users'))for something like a complete reload?. 

issue: "Maximum call stack size exceeded" - anybody? in beta.1 
solution: 

issue: which one is better for angular2, webpack or systemjs? 
solution: MurhafSousli: i would go with the setup from angular.io tutorial if i was asking that question :). MurhafSousli: systemjs is good for being able to get started on a project quickly but currently, it isn't easy to bundle it into one file (or a few files)...webpack takes more setup, but once you're setup, it's easy to get it into one file and be production ready. Hojou: it depends if you're working on a real project or not. If you are then it can be a pain to switch over your setup...if you're just doodling, then yeah, systemjs all the way. 

issue: does anyone have an idea on the animate utilization? 
solution: With Renderer can we get attributes/styles/classes? The docs say nothing about it, it only works to set things, not to get them. Is ElementRef the only option for this case?. 

issue: Hi, can I ask questions about Angular 1.x here? 
solution: no, see the title.. callado4: There is the angular.js channel. 

issue: shouldn’t the attribute be camelCase ? 
solution: I don't think it cares as long as it matches.. you have to do funny stuff if it's kebab case. (or maybe that just plain won't work anymore). 

issue: What do you know about draggable on angular 2.0? I guess all those plugins which were writen for angular 1.x will need to be rewriten. 
solution: CrackerakiUA: beware of calling nativeElement, though. its usually better to go through the Renderer so your app is not tightly coupled with the DOM. 

issue: hi, how to using a relative templateurl in angular 2? 
solution: 

issue: Come on@escardin, we are all on your side You should ping Rob anyway 
solution: 

issue: straight to the point, any ideas on i18n for Angular2? 
solution: 

issue: which ide is good for angular js? 
solution: merlin2049er: seems a lot of people use webstorm/phpstorm it has good typescript support … others have suggested using Visual Studio Code… VSC is free. 

issue: Does any one know if angular has the intention to build touch (swipe etc etc) stuff in NG2 like there is in NG1? 
solution: basvandenheuvel: There are host listeners [<-LINK->] , i worked with click, mouseover and such, and they are native browser listeners. Probably you need to configure swipe host with help of third party library, which emulate that. 

issue: I wonder how you can be so patient,@escardin 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys I'm having trouble  calling the .finally(()=>{}) when an observable errors out.  am i doing this wrong? [<-CODE->] 
solution: that's when the docs said it would be populated because of parents populating before children, although I admit to not knowing about ngAfterContentInit(). 

issue: I've been enjoying having to do things myself for a change, frameworks have spoiled me :P 
solution: it'd probably be impossible to use something like formly with webworkers for example... at least right now...then I'd imagine you'd might need to dynamically load components to achieve some of the same things. The whole approach would need to be a bit different.. 

issue: hi, is there anything like cacheFactory in Angular2? 
solution: martinoppitz: there are two use cases:1) store user preferences in localStorage2) cache transformed service responses for a while. 

issue: when next beta? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: qdouble: Looking at that you can already use it with npm3 but  it might be that not everything is working as fast as it can be?. it hasn't been merged into the release yet, but it should be soon, maybe in the next beta or two. 

issue: is the (deep)Copy Function of Angular 1 still somewhere in Angular 2? 
solution: pascalwhoop: I believe it was replaced by the es6 object.assign.. escardin: as always, glad to see you here and thanks for the quick tip :). 

issue: does *ngIf update on async ops? 
solution: I assumed it wouldnt. 

issue: potentially silly question; would we inject ChatAPI into the constructor? 
solution: we're using a microsvc arch that relies on you being able to retrieve data from a service we're hosting locally right now so it could be quite difficult unfortunately. 

issue: robwormald: is there a way to use@ViewChild/@ComponentChildto get Dom elements that aren't Components/Directives?  vs usingelementRef.nativeElement+ jQuery? 
solution: 

issue: Can i reach $window in Angular 2?? 
solution: 

issue: Don't mess with eventEmitter's isAsync 
solution: crystalbyte: i was referring to the eventemitter isAsync thing. 

issue: Hi there, someone has an idea why this angular 2 "hello world" is not working in Internet Explorer 11? If I am not wrong Angular 2 should work in IE 11 [<-LINK->] 
solution: crystalbyte: ... if you do onPush change detection, it seems that if you're using async pipe for input, you don't need to use markForCheck in most instances. 

issue: What i miss here: [<-LINK->] Why i can't query div's with #outer 
solution: 

issue: from where to download angular2 d.ts file in order to work properly with it? 
solution: 

issue: hi, here I am. I am going to prepare a gist 
solution: brandonroberts:  [<-LINK->] I have those two methods calling each other. If I load data with via http the data is displayed instantly. 

issue: can i do a global capture of key events within a component ? as in jquery’s $(document).on(‘keydown’) 
solution: I pulledObservable.fromEvent(el.nativeElement, 'drop')from [<-LINK->]. 

issue: What's the error? 
solution: Yeah, too big for a plunk. Sorry.. 

issue: Is their a way i can append a checkbox to body dynamically  with angular bindings and events and make it work ?? 
solution: 

issue: is there a way to get DI injection into your@CanActivate(myFunction)? 
solution: mhov: no. one workaround is to export appinjector as a const, then another function as a const, then pass that function to@CanActivate, then access appinjector const inside that function and get a hold to your services manually. 

issue: beta 1 is a mess as far as bug 
solution: 

issue: I have a problem. Is anyone willing to help? 
solution: Just a quick login. 

issue: With webpack you can create entry points that would let you to separate your app into different files, right? Wouldn't that be helpful to reduce the size? 
solution: ericmartinezr: yeah, that combined with the async route you could cut your bundles down.. so on my project I have different url to get REST on test and prod so I'm looking best way to set it accordingly to ENVyou can also read hostname and set variable. 

issue: is designing not working? 
solution: 

issue: all, what is your preference app/components/todos app/services/todos OR app/todos/components app/todos/services ? 
solution: In java server side, it is common to put all your database classes together, and all your controllers together, etc.... 

issue: The specific layout you choose isn't something you should strictly follow a prescriptive formula or best practice. You should however make a conscious decision about the tradeoffs your proposed layout has, vs other layouts. No matter what choice you make, if you know the reasons for it, you can make a new choice later when those reasons no longer apply 
solution: 

issue: is depency injection the same as importing modules? 
solution: basiclaser: No. DI is DI, [<-LINK->] . And Importing modules is javascript module system i belive.. basvandenheuvel: thx! <3. majo: Look at ngContent: [<-LINK->]. You can use it to add content inside a directive as you need it. 

issue: What are the reasons for the directive(ngSubmit)not working ? I have 10 forms, it works in 9 :( 
solution: crystalbyte: Little hard to so without information or a plnkr :). It seems submit doesn't work inside a bootstrap modal dialog :(. 

issue: is there any JS pro here 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I'm frist time to use angularjs. I'm have problem about how to download angularjs2 to my computer. T T 
solution: 

issue: Is it possible to define multiple selectors for a single component? 
solution: I am wanting to create a three panel view for a website and to be able to re-use the three panels for multiple pages throughout the site. I have also added logic to make the side panels slide in and out and I don't want to have to copy the code. 

issue: Is it possible to create a route alias, such as /foo => /bar 
solution: MarkPerryBV: It might, but the typescript signature does not include a redirectTo property, no Javascript is generated.I tried with plain javascript unfortunately this does not seem to work: [<-CODE->]. 

issue: how can I test component that uses RouteParams? I'm gettingNo provider for RouteParamserror 
solution: arozwalak:  [<-LINK->]. arozwalak: or [<-LINK->]. arozwalak: I haven't tried this myself yet, but I saw it mentioned thatRootRouterneeds to be provided. Can you please report back when you get it working?. 

issue: Hi everyone i have a question about how to style a jqueryui element with a css developed in an angular2 component. 
solution: I know  i will develop it. So basically i am developping a simple angular2 component. In that angular2 component I create a slider using Jquery and Jqueryui. Then i create a css linked to my angular2 component. The style applyes to the div containing the slider but not to the different slider components such as the handles. I think it is because the "_ngcontent-xx" attribute is not added on the elements created by jquery.. xArkanEx: that may take a bit of trial and error and inspecting the dom as angular and jquery often set class attributes dynamically, so there could potentially be conflicts and unknowns. 

issue: Anyone got a plunkr for a Dynamic Router? 
solution: basvandenheuvel: And to yourself fine fellow!. basvandenheuvel: Has a good plunkr for this type of thing.. 

issue: Is the injector system suppose to provide the parent component to the constructor of a child component? 
solution: 

issue: How can I access the component's attributes when I'm testing it? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: Take all of those out They are already in the bootstrap so they are global 
solution: @brandonroberts  basically this:auth.check().subscribe((result) => {doesn' return any result, but I don't know why. 

issue: Has anyone managed to get AsyncRoute to work with webpack? 
solution: if you go with@klinem's way know that you are messing with private apis and it may break in the future.. 

issue: How should I get element properties/styles from component template in Angular 2? 
solution: height, width. I want to create some kind of splittable workspace like in 3D editors. 

issue: .do() ? 
solution: 

issue: In case anyone is curious (@episodeyang? ), I built a plunker for that service lifecycle question: [<-LINK->] 
solution: in summary, OnDestroy won't apply to services. They are created whenever the component providing it is created (of course), but you ned to manage its cleanup yourself, so I assume that the component providing it needs to implement OnDestroy and call somethng on the serrvice for its cleanup once that component is being destroyed. angular just creates that service every time the component is created, its up to you to track the components destruction and clean up that service. 

issue: Hi all, im wondering if any of you lovely people could help my with change detection in angular 2? 
solution: i have an object that is fetched via http and put into various form elements, when any of the values are changed i need to see what has changed etc, i have tried to implement the ngOnChanges method but it never seems to fire?. you want something more like:<input (click)='doClickStuff($event)' >. 

issue: systemjs or commonjs which do you recommend, what is the difference actully? 
solution: from requirejs (angular1) -> systemjs (angular2 hybrid). 

issue: This is an angular chat room righ? 
solution: i mean, angular2 on node should be your back end. 

issue:  [<-ISSUE->] - is it related to what you discuss? 
solution: that looks good! thanks for all the help@escardin. i have a much better idea about how to set everything up. 

issue: hey guys I want the controller to get the defaulttextContentof a button this can not be part of the template, what is the best way? I just need to get this once. 
solution: zoechi: I have xml data retrieve user information get from server and I want to use it with angular 2 in login page with json and then send back to server as xml so I was confused and lack of example. 

issue: Is there a way to get the AppCcomponent instnace? (I can get the type, I need the insace) 
solution: zoechi: it will return the class, not the instance. I think it not possible due to isolation and privacy... components in DI expose a class, not an instance and this is quite logical. 

issue: Where's the best place to call a jquery plugin in a component ? NgOnInit or NgAfterViewInit? 
solution: But I need to use slick slider. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: sjclemmy: ^. I guess so, for the complete callback they just don't pass anything. 

issue: Does TestComponentBuilder creates a component without default directives? 
solution: zoechi: , I believe CORE_DIRECTIVES are included by default in a component. In my spec I'd like to use CORE_DIRECTIVES, but no idea how to set directives using TestComponentBuilder. 

issue: Can I select the commits to "put on top"? 
solution: So if I'm behind angular master after I committed my stuff in my fork, I can sync. The new stuff will be in a commit above my stuff because it happend later. That's when I can rebase my commit so it's on top again?. 

issue: -23 C / -9 F here. 
solution: voteban!. to create a new component that accepts ngModel can i just inject it?. then use_model.modelandmodel.update.next(val). 

issue: Anyone have any awesome build system examples to share? Or do you guys know what is recommended by the Angular team? 
solution: I don’t like that jspm seems to be built on top of npm in a way and messes with package.json, etc.. webpack has one of the steeper learning curves, but you can just use a starter to get going and study it. 

issue: done 
solution: yay!. *understood most of it already. I think immutable.js just added an extra layer of complexity, but all in all it was worth learning. The app moves very fast when you follow this structure and your other components become very simple. It's just getting over the initial learning curve that is the challenge, but it's pretty slick afterwards. 

issue: hi guys, i am trying to write a pipe to orderBy, could do with a little help as I seem to be stuck 
solution: 

issue: the functionmethod()was fired more the 1000 times, can anyone tell me why? [<-CODE->] 
solution: MurhafSousli: that may work better if you were using onPush change detection, as you are using normal change detection, it may fire the method for every check. onPush makes your change detection policy manual... it has some advantages of speeding up your app and stopping change detection from going crazy like yours is doing, but then you'd have to switch to using observables and doing events and such...basically you'd design your app differently. So unless you want to redesign your app, may not want to use  {{ method() }}. 

issue: allow me to ask again: what would be the best way to pass a parameter such as a regular expression to a custom validator: [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: Is there a way to flatten this into one line ? [<-CODE->] 
solution: crystalbyte: did that elvis operator expression work for you? I thought this was not available in TS just yet. nosachamos: I dont think this is a typescript feature, it seems to be an angular2 thing such as the pipe.. 

issue: What is the best way to generate dynamic html content using angular js 2.0? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] is it a "promise"? 
solution: 

issue: if anyone can help me with an attribute directive, please pm 
solution: 

issue: Does anyone know why there is anngSubmitEventEmitter? When looking at the source ofngForm, it listens for a submit Event and then emits thengSubmitemitter. But I don't see any reason why there is a separate Event... 
solution: maybe also they wanted to be consistent, and outputs are generally the way directives and components talk to the external world. It would be somewhat awkward to say that theNgFormdirective has as part of its "public API" a native event, I think. 

issue: How to calm down parser here? [<-CODE->] 
solution: ericmartinezr: since I switched to ngStore and observables, I've been using onPush like 100% of the time, so it doesn't annoy too much...but it initializes to true even when it's false with that change detection strategy: [<-LINK->]. escardin: well I wish I would have had it, was playing around with it for like an hour or so last night but didn't think of creating a control group and passing that or doing the addControl, but I guess that's since I didn't fully know all of the api. 

issue: anybody know how to create an ngForm where the form is on the parent and form field inputs are on the child and it works and updates properly? 
solution: qdouble: Sounds related to what I was just dealing with. The [(property)] "two-way" binding doesn\'t really seem to behave as the \'cheat sheet\' suggests... but even before all my issues I was able to get an object bound from parent to child pretty well. I think my complication was related to the string primitive. You should be able to pass an object model down to the child with the inputs.. 

issue: ? 
solution: 

issue: How do you access inputs: ['person'] from Component  controller? 
solution: if you declare it ininputs: []there's no need to use@Input. 

issue: you can pass input via paths or queries, though,right? 
solution: 

issue: what do I need to import { } to use@Output/ EventEmitter ? 
solution: long back, i suggested the team to introduce containers to import related stuff rather than doing it one by one...  there was a git issue for this but idk what happened to that.. afirdousi: they do have ROUTER_DIRECTIVES, FORM_DIRECTIVES, etc, if that's what you mean. But certain things like output and eventemitter you need to import. 

issue: which should i use to learn angular 2, typescript or javascript? 
solution: I don't like suggesting using the DCL because it's meant for frameworky type stuff.. roxcity:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: are you developing on localhost? 
solution: that will always happen on localhost. look into “jsonp". and read up on “CORS". 

issue: can anyone answer this?.  [<-LINK->] 
solution: after i create component and compiled the application. if i delete that component by force i can't create component by that deleted component's name?.. 

issue: what's the best way to integrate jquery with angular2 jqueryUi is there any doc around? 
solution: just google smt like angular jqGrid or qngular datetimepicker. koodikindral: if you want to use ANY lib that messes with the DOM, you should wrap it in a component or directive. Usually a component (something like a UI widget would be a component, something that doesn't generate UI would plausibly be a directive). Anything inside that component should probably be considered not angular2 and used very cautiously.. 

issue: It's generally recommended to try to do as much you can within angular instead of jquery, but you can find samples of how to integrate different stuff on google search 
solution: yeah, I mean angular plugins are starting to pop-up and many more will over time...probably would be best to tackle as much as you can in angular first and just go to jquery last... there's already unofficial builds of ui-bootstrap and other plugs. 

issue: when the release angular 2 ? 
solution: robwormald: it will be better than to react? Will need to study the angular  again?. that's a very subjective question :).  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: hey guys! got stuck with test that involves Router. Could anyone please look here? [<-LINK->] 
solution: ericmartinezr: @alvipeoYou mean ROUTER_PROVIDERS goes in Bootstrap array, but you still inject Router in the constructor, right?. now if I do this"beforeEachProviders(() => { [<-CODE->] I get - Cannot resolve all params for IlgGalleryInfoEdit (Router, ?, FormBuilder). 

issue: can any one help me with http?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: bhaskeryadav: i assume your problem is not with http. the problem is probably with the whole packaging/setup of your app. 

issue: Does Angular2 ready to be used in new projects? Does beta means that its not ready, and I should user Angular 1.X branch for new project 
solution: Angular 2 lacks a solid coverage of documentation and tutorials and is still changing by every release. If you plan on having something in prod I would suggest 1.x.. 

issue: does it show up the same in browser devtools? this isn't an angular question 
solution: yes. i m able to view the response. in thebrowser devtools. 

issue: how can i use XMLHttpRequest ? 
solution: bhaskeryadav: if http doesn't work for you, you can just use an XHR like you would with vanillajs.. tbh@bhaskeryadavfor like 99% of use cases I would not pick XHR directly.. 

issue: :D 
solution: 

issue: qdouble: @ericmartinezrI'm curious as how to get a good shave as well...currently playing with using bootstrap and material...bootstrap mostly just for it's grid and tables right now and using some of materials buttons...but wondering how only use what I need instead of the whole libraries.... I'm using sass on both 
solution: ericmartinezr: I feel you...I'm a noob at most of this :).... won't be finalizing design stuff for a few weeks so not as worried...  I notice importing the unofficial ng2 material adds like 300k or something to your project, so will definitely have to start looking into how to only get the necessary stuff when production phase starts to get closer. 

issue: brandonroberts: could you make it possible to aux routes too? :D 
solution: 

issue: Hi everybody can someone please help me? 
solution: I have property inside each object in this array, which called use. 

issue: What IDE's do you guys use? 
solution: Many people say Atom is nice, but never tried it. 

issue: is it possible somehow to give value for the templateUrl inside a component at runtime? 
solution: @DavidGangel you could try using a custom URL resolver: [<-CODE->] Then you could specify it as a provider at some point in your app.  Maybe when you bootstrap it: [<-CODE->]. 

issue: why bower will not be supported for NG2? 
solution: 

issue: why do you need bower if everything is in npm? 
solution: 

issue: Can I mock module dependencies of a module? 
solution: JesusisFreedom: you may not be in a zone, so angular will not fire change detection for you. This is expected given that Your observable is coming from Observable.fromEventPattern() and not from a dom/browser/whatever event.. 

issue: Can *ngFor be nested? 
solution: and each local variable will persist?. 

issue: Is there an easy way to put a new observable in the NgZone or doeszone.runhave to be used inside the subscribe method for change detection to happen?  [<-LINK->] robwormald: Any insight? 
solution: escardin: Yeah. I am guessing it is because observables are an import so they can’t be patched by NgZone. It isn’t the end of the world to have to call zone.run, or detectChanges, etc., I was just wondering if there was a way to patch observables so that they always run in the zone.. 

issue: can't seem to get ruler to work and it doesn't seem to be much info or examples on github... is there any other way to get a dynamically loaded component's height? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, can I access RouteParams from a Service? 
solution: if you need it, it's a bad Service. pass it from controller as an argument. 

issue: Hi guys, can you suggest how'd you tackle this: [<-ISSUE->] ? I might be just missing a pattern. 
solution: Say I want to provide a function that my component would call to get a value from above. 

issue: hey can we use jspm + karma to test angular2 apps now? I searched in the chat but couldn't find any answers. 
solution: 

issue: Bump. Anyone have any insight into my previous question? Many thanks. 
solution: escardin: From today, refined from yesterday. but the same issue none the less. May I ask where you sent the PM today, as I have not been alerted to one?. 

issue: Hi, angular2 can be used only with npm? 
solution: I have not worked with asp.net but seeing as this is webtechnology i assume that there is not much preventing you from serving it up?. 

issue: on v2, where are angular.copy / angular.extend ? 
solution: jacargentina: though to be honest, using those is a bit of a code smell imo.. escardin: So, somewhere i hadangular.extend(this, params);i must putObject.assign(this, params);?. 

issue: i cant use templateUrl inside component.. anyone? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: are they observable? Observable.forkJoin. Are they promises? Promise.all 
solution: 

issue: What IDE would you recommended for developing Angular2 apps? 
solution: 

issue: hi abidmix: did you fix your problem. it looks like it's working 
solution: You want startWith() [<-LINK->] see line 35 of app.component(and the associated import at the top). 

issue: How can I get the width and height of component in Angular2? 
solution: karan718:  [<-LINK->]. I didn't use b.45 I started with b.49 but since thenElementRefwas always available and never deprecated. 

issue: Hello. When using router and load a component in an <router-outlet> how do I pass in inputs via property binding or what is a workaround? 
solution: I see. I have a PersonFormComponent that I would like to use with a specific [person]="person" input that my host component already got from a service. So I have to pass a route parameter like ID and get the person again from the service!? That sucks. Thanks anyway.. 

issue: How do I bind an html element name attribute to an angular js variable [name]="variable" does not work 
solution: 

issue: anyone installed beta.3? 
solution: i installed tsd globally now which makes it work, but isnt that kinda weird?. 

issue: any docs on [style.x] directive?need to change the image url. in docs there\'s only [style.width.px]="whatever" background image url* 
solution: qdouble: - i need to apply inline style to div with background image. I saw that [style.x] syntax in docs but the solution is using the ngStyle directive from angular/commoncan't really see why there are two style directives... qdouble: actually in my taste the [style.width.px] is much more elegant for that purpose but I can't find docs for other css properties such as background imagetried background-image.url, background-image without success. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] isn't this working anymore in the newest beta? 
solution: 

issue: JesusisFreedom: :host{} 
solution: JesusisFreedom: are you loading the scss through webpack's rawloader?. if so, then have it like just like thisstyles: require('file.scss'). then in the scss have:host{ display:block }. 

issue: @zoechi controlling scroll in webworkers using the messagebus is suprisingly easy, only hard to figure out because the documentation sucks right now (and is wrong)On the worker render UI, you'll do [<-CODE->] then in your component, you'll do [<-CODE->] 
solution: Yeah, I don't think it will be as difficult to work with as I thought it would, it's just about waiting for the documentation to catch up....but it seems like angular will handle a lot of the low level stuff for us. 

issue: Hey! Can anyone help me make a ajax get request with angular? 
solution: you need to add the http package (faq problem). 

issue: can anyone help out 
solution: JahlomP: looks like a server problem (CORS). 

issue: how i can use some services in@CanActivateblock? 
solution: Passhag: not without a workaround. See [<-LINK->]. brandonroberts: when i'm trying let auth: Auth = injector.get(Auth);let router: Router = injector.get(Router);. 

issue: so the server need to add another header so the browser is giving me the wanted headers? 
solution: 

issue: noone got an idea ? : o is it possible to do [hidden] on observables ? 
solution: 

issue: how do you set multiple event handlers on a click? 
solution: you call a function which does multiple things. i guess there's some pros to this way.. 

issue: how we do backend proxy in angular 2 how we connect to the backend in angular2 how we connect to the backend in angular2 
solution: rumes: that's more or less just a development issue...you could run on the same server and port... however, if you need to run on two different ports.....set 'localhost:PORT' to a shared variable that you can change between dev and production...then set it to send to other port while in development and enable cors on your data server. 

issue: uh, so summary has a component with a toggle method? 
solution: summaries is an array<SummaryModel>. 

issue: hi! using that state management idea from @vsavkin and here's what my ngOnInit looks like to put a component in editing mode via RouteParams: [<-CODE->] Since all this is new to my I now wonder if it's a correct way of doing thins or at least this may be improved. 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] typically it's more related to value changing and change detection cycles not form builder... also it seems you're using both ngForm and formbuilder, so that may be causing a conflict as well 
solution: 

issue: hi, I'm pointing to master and the new way to handle 3rd party libraries is giving me some problem. Should master branch create a working project in this moment? 
solution: 

issue: in this demo: [<-LINK->] , what is Item? Where is it coming from? Is that a model? It's never imported far as I can tell. 
solution: 

issue: i am getting Observable_1.Observable.fromArray is not a function in [null] while calling Observable.fromArray what am i missing ? 
solution: 

issue: Where did you addHomeServiceto providers? 
solution: The preferred way is to use a source file per class. This avoid the problem as long as you don\'t have circular dependencies. If you don\'t want to do this you can useforwardRef(() => HomeService). I don\'t know what it means "using providers in component". I thought this was what you were doing.. 

issue: please remind me what is new scope.apply? please 
solution: 

issue: it returns `this.model.slice is not a function',@zoechii am using  es6 
solution: zoechi: still data is behind by one event,  it worked before when i used local variables inside the component , this only happend when i used the class/model convention.. 

issue: did something change with zones? 
solution: 

issue: ~1 
solution: 

issue: thbt: do you get auto-completion / content-assist for attributes and methods also in Angular2 templates when using Atom + typescript plugin? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] @escardinmaybe you can help me with that? :) 
solution: 

issue: well... how can I put all templates in one file? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I\'m having trouble with cryptic error messages from the router. Wonder if anyone could help. My app has two components  wich contain child routes. For one of the components the routing works fine. For the other, when I navigate to the detail component, the router throws the error : Error: Component "ContentDetail" has no route config. After painstakingly  going through the configuration of the two components several times, I cannot  find any difference  f I cannot find any difference between the two configs. Has anybody some experience  with errors related to child routing? 
solution: 

issue: I have not found a way to delete a component. I posted a question in Stackoverflow at [<-LINK->] 
solution: varghesep: yes, you can dispose of a component. in the resolved promise of the call to load a component you get a component ref. from there you can do componentref.dispose(). tbqh, once you dive into the DCL you are largely on your own.. 

issue: morning all...q: can a component reference itself in a template?  (example: a tree view)  [<-CODE->] 
solution: getChildren(bcItem) is definitately being called, however, it appears that a new instance of client-list-2 is never being created. You might need to add it to the directives list of itself, probably with aforwardRef(()=> ClientList2)(hope syntax is correct). 

issue: how do I access router on my component ? 
solution: pantonis: import {RouteConfig}, and use it as a decorator on a component. Follow the [<-LINK->] if you need help. 

issue: but would it be a good idea to start a new project in Angular 1.x? 
solution: Kinda laughed when I read things like "Angular 2 syntax is much easier" ...  setting it up is 10000 times harder. yes, and the need to load endless libs. 

issue: can i use firebase with angular 2?. 
solution: I am wondering if there is an overview of all of the possibilities to migrate. All I find at this moment is either a 'Big Bang' approach or  an 'Incremental' approach. I wonder if there is somewhere a tool that applies the Big bang approach par example.. 

issue: Angular 2 really? 
solution: angular2 is still in beta just saying... 

issue: Hi guys, what's the best solution for list of checkbox and submit button, by clicking submit I want to get list of checked checkboxes values? for now I have two arrays [<-CODE->] 
solution: escardin: Just to conclude: my retryWhen() nightmare has come to an end. I chose to use catch() in the end, because I must modify the request header. This might be possible, but it is not particularly transparent. I settled on the following, works fine: [<-CODE->]. 

issue: is it like heroku + support + framework? 
solution: lots of AWS Cli tools out there for spinning up instances etc. Yeah I guess. I dunno it just doesn't seem in the spirit of open source. If I'm gonna spend a ton of time learning something completely new, I don't want to be tied to one company. But that's fine, to each their own.. 

issue: is it possible for the app level element (the component that is bootstrapped to have@Inputs? 
solution: basically you can inject an elementRef and just grab the attribute in the constructor the one time. 

issue: how much can using typescript reduce when it comes to tests, if any? 
solution: 

issue: Guys, how can i do a page refresh on ng2? 
solution: JahlomP: Basically what@qdoublesaid. I do not recall seeing areload()API in any of the DOM adapter stuff or the Router's Location service. I recommend wrapping the call in a customReloadservice so that you can easily mock it out.. 

issue: can I use.phpfiles instead of.htmlfor angular2? 
solution: MurhafSousli: Well there's technically nothing stopping you from doing so. The only file that would be PHP is index.html, however - all other HTML is baked into components.. 

issue: Has anyone had any success implementing radio buttons with beta.6? Cannot figure out how to use it... 
solution: cur3n4: Ended up doing<input name="gender" type="radio" [checked]="model.gender == 1" (change)="model.gender=1">. 

issue: Oops that reminds me to update the starter to beta6 
solution: 

issue: ng 2 rouer isn't working properly in my case. when i go to [<-LINK->] 404 not found i can only open my site through index page only 
solution: roxcity: angular is only running on your index.html page... if you need to go to another route directly, your server needs to redirect it to index.html or you would need to switch to hash location strategy. 

issue: Is there any native data grid for NG2? anyone? 
solution: harangue: yeah, after building my own grids... I doubt I'll use a third party grid even if one comes out now... if you know how to mix parent/child component  together properly, you can create your own grids with a lot less boilerplate. I founds a lot of the time you think you save by using third party grids you waste trying to customize or debug. 

issue: good morning, noob question.  How can I create dynamic "routerLink"s.  The following does not work [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: I wonder has anybody tried combiningangular2@beta6 withng2-material@0.2.2yet succesfully ? 
solution: KlausConrado: I am running into errors when i try using it within the following project:. "No Directive annotation found on MdAnchor". 

issue: damoncasale: have you seen dispatchEvent in my example? 
solution: Object.defineProperty(event, 'keyCode', {'value': 13});input.nativeElement.dispatchEvent(event);. 

issue: Guys i have AppComponent with some RouteConfigs how can i check if my component has changed? 
solution: jorgeunimicro: but does the routeroutlet route work when you click a routerLink as well or doesn't that require a canactivate ?. 

issue: Does anyone have a good resource/list for events that can be called as attributes e.g (click)="someFunc()" 
solution: alanswansafeware: that's for all events an element fires. Either look the element up at [<-LINK->] (input example). 

issue: any one has an ecample link for EventEmitter with generic one. 
solution: kargenc: use a subject instead of an EventEmitter in a service. Event Emitters are generally used for components. 

issue: Can anyone tell me about angular 2 official release . actually   i am planning to build one app using angular 2 . so just i wanted to know that whether it will safe to start with angular 2 ? 
solution: kamleshKumarVerma: No word on an actual full release date yet. But the beta should be safe to use for production. Testing is a bit difficult and confusing at the moment. Especially if you want to mock connections. They are still planning on improving this. You'll notice there isn't much documentation about this yet either because of this.. 

issue: Hi, there is any way to know if an observable is not ready? Waiting for result? Any operator likehttp.get('myurl').while(()=>console.log('waiting for result')).subscribe(...)? 
solution: 

issue: Hello - how can i check if my state is changed on Angular 2.0 
solution: but i looking @ route change. adrianwarkocz: these are lyfecycle hooks, maybe one of them fits with your needs: [<-LINK->]. adrianwarkocz: I think you need to do that with low level javascript. But maybe you can share your use case so we can give you a better answer. 

issue: So If I provide a built out js file to my NOJA (Nasty Old Javascript App) and some where in that app I have the app component selector html it will "just work" 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: can you open [<-LINK->]. Man... those talks will be streamed, right? Most likely, but still.... 

issue: send your data instead of a rendered page? 
solution: escardin: you mean like dynamic loading input components in a for       <tr *ngFor="#row of rows "  (click)="rowLinkEvent($event,row)"  ><td *ngFor="#col of columns" >. 

issue: still not quite getting how to walk up the component tree from the child :( 
solution: client (ID: 111)...campaign (ID: 222)......segment (ID: 333)I  need to crate a route 111/222/333.  So my idea was to walk up the components to get the id of the parents to. 

issue: Does anybody know anybody that has gotten angular2 to work to VS2015?  I'm seriously struggling, it seems like M$ is WAY behind the curve on this one... 
solution: yeah, vs2015 claims to support node.js, bower, and typescript. but is simply does NOT, I've been hacking away at it and it doesn't even support a tsconfig.js file at all, period, end of story.  But if I install from the command line it won't even compile, I get so many typescript errors it's silly, even after hacking the project file to basically ignore everything. 

issue: HELLO{{!}}How to detect current route in component? 
solution: ericmartinezr: it will only give URL, and I need route path :). ericmartinezr: I found this way:router.isRouteActive(router.generate(['/MyRouteName'])). 

issue: i cannot integrate angular 2 with nginx does anyone know? 
solution: roxcity: just serving the static content for angular? sure, if you are under non-root path, you need to configure your nginx to handle that aliasing to the real root path were angular application lives. If you mean pre-rendering content, I think you need something with nginx like prerender and more configuration. 

issue: Am planning to start a new project with angular now..is it better to start using angular 2 right away or is it better to stick to v1 at the moment? 
solution: I\'d say go with Angular2, but I\'d suggest that you benchmark different options - there aren\'t many similarities between angularjs and angular to give any leg up on going with "angular 2" compared to other solutions. Angular is beta, but very much usable and it is used in production, some things are in flux like testing might change, and localisation/i18n are some ways off. 

issue: how do you typically communicate between 2 components? 
solution: which means that if it takes a long time to come up with a pi digit, you might not have a value right away. a behaviour subject would give the most recent value immediately and then work like a subject. 

issue: Hi I need to make a link in the template to and id of the template itself => href="#id" how can I achieve it with the routerLink? 
solution: ronakvbhatt07: I want  to create the link, if I make a html<a href="#id" ...is obviously not working. I presume I need to go for the ng2 way of creating a link that seem to merouterLink. Am I wrong?. ronakvbhatt07: I need only to move the browser on that part of the html. You are suggesting that what was previously in html half a line of code is now a definition in the component, import of dependencies, etc.... to make a fake route that will never will be really used by the component but only in the already rendered html? Look I don't need to move to another page, it's in the same page it's a reference to the same page, I would expect there is a simpler way to do that. 

issue: Anyone knows why I can't use RxJS classes? [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: why angular use typescript instead of ecmascript6 
solution: mahmutduva: ecmascript 6 is not supported by most browsers yet. With typescript you have all the ecmascript 6 improvements and it can compile back to es5. Which most browsers do support.And besides that, it also adds typings. If used correctly (don't type everything as 'any') it can prevent a lot of possible bugs.. 

issue: let a = ['a', 'b', 'c'];let b = [...a]; // should create an array copyconsole.log(a === b); 
solution: 

issue: Can you use a service with an observable? 
solution: Essentially you have an observable in an app service (so to speak) that you can watch essentially from any component.. 

issue: bitby: but the solution is? 
solution: You should use renderer though. and now for something completely different... [<-LINK->] is there a way to make my listener.directivesonKeyupfirebeforethe parentsonKeyupgets called?. or do i have to capture the event in the directives handler and use another channel/emitter for the child-to-parent communication?. 

issue: Need help on csv export in Angular 2 ? 
solution: So you'll need to look how to do it with plain javascript and then make it work inside angular. ericmartinezr: to migrating my current  angular1 to angular2 is so painful, so many roadblock :). 

issue: How does one programmatically set a control's value? Is there a setValue function or something? 
solution: 

issue: is it possible to load the angular2 router in an angular1 app bootstrapped with ngUpgrade? 
solution: brandonroberts: have you seen an example? I’m getting "Error: Bootstrap at least one component before injecting Router” when trying to added providers: [ROUTER_PROVIDERS] to the angular2 component. jasonpearson: you need to provide the root component: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: but will this eventuallysetthe input elements "readonly" [<-LINK->] ? 
solution: 

issue: does it need to be disabled? whatabout readonly? 
solution: imagine a disabled button would allow click events. as far i can see, disabled attribute on an input field "disables" click events. 

issue: something like this? [<-CODE->] 
solution: escardin: I tried it like that.  "Here 2" never shows up.. So that doesn't help either.. 

issue: why to send that firebase without validation? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] I get this how can I exclude it from not looking into the node_modules? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] pls help, how can i create OpenUrlCommandManager in main.ts with same intance for  CommandTypeEventManager injected to ViewPortContoller 
solution: ericmdantas: when i do that  OpenUrlCommandManager not created... OpenUrlCommandManager not injected any component i want created at main.ts.. 

issue: do you have their typings installed individually? Hello 
solution: 

issue: is there any way to exclude all d.ts files? 
solution: 

issue: yup, I'm wondering how he adds the bundle because I see nothng in the index file 
solution: if i do this in entry: 'polyfills': Path.join(__dirname, 'client', 'polyfills.ts’),, then polyfills gets all the requires and the app runs. 

issue: Anyone aware of any similar issues regarding zone patching when loading certain external libraries? [<-LINK->] 
solution: brandom: probably it repatches something that ng2 patched? If you put the lib above angular2 polyfills it works too. 

issue: CrackerakiUA: 
solution: and something familiar in other component, so user called 2 times, how can i make something like factory in angular 1. I like the idea to have code of user management inside one class or something familiar. In angular 1 i would build factory user which will had all functions of user like update,delete etc.. 

issue: Have you guys been using _prefix for private fields in Components? I find it annoying 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Can i link to the child route directly then? 
solution: as long as you're within the right context yes. you can't go /en/home from / without knowing the id, but you can click a link ['Home'] on /en/things to go to /en/home. 

issue: Hi there,What is the best way to deploy angular2 app? 
solution: I am looking for something like yeoman angular-generator. There are four linked starters. 

issue: and how can i subscribe to a subject? 
solution: basically, in your component doservice.newItems.subscribe(dostuff), in your service havepublic newItems=new Subject()and when you save a new item [<-CODE->]. 

issue: you want to use the parent's encapsulation or not? 
solution: I suppose I could make the player encapsulated and the children not, but then have all the css for the child components be applied on the player component.. That may work? since I would never package the player WITHOUt the child components. And I would not package the control bar without the player.. 

issue: aure--what? 
solution: 

issue: Is anyone using atom for typescript? 
solution: datoml: I use atom-typescript. because tslint allways complains about the double quotes from the import snipped :D. 

issue: Hey, How to block validation, while user doesn't stop typing'email' : ['', Validators.compose([CustomValidators.factory().email])], 
solution: soszin92: You can't stop it, don't show it. You can validate whole form at the end:this.form.validwill resolve. 

issue: Hey, How to delay validation? 
solution: ericmartinezr: I need delay validator when i want check if email exist in database, and run validator when typing stop. 

issue: hey guys, so what's a replacement for mergeMap in the latest rxjs ? 
solution: ekarlso: mergeMap has no replacement. mergeMap is a rename for flatMap in rxjs5. ericmartinezr: hmmm, I used .mergeMap(foo => Observable.from(foo)) earlier but now it says it doesn't match the signature :(. 

issue: ? 
solution: 

issue: With angular 2 all thisfoo.$inject = ['$state', '$element'];is not necessary anymore right? 
solution: 

issue: Quick question, do pipe(s) only work on strings or will they work on numbers too?  I'm using TypeScript. 
solution: npx: ,@zoechi, Yeah that's what I thought I have numbers holding currency values and a date and it's messing up the screen. ilennert: hard to tell from here but should be easy to investigate in browser devtools when you investigate how the generated DOM looks like. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: well, the demo there is functional. 

issue: woah just updated from beta.0 to beta.7 is it me or is it like 2x faster ? 
solution: no it’s private stuff in a company i am working in, i cannot share unfortunately, but perhaps i will open source a version of it… it’s a component that allows you to select a picture from your drive, crop it using croppie.js and upload to amazon s3 directly using evaporateJS. 

issue: is plnkr down or is just me having problems? 
solution: pantonis: I also am facing that :/. and now I came across this: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: EXCEPTION: No provider for AuthHttp! (App -> AuthHttp) i already installed angular-jwt imported and bootstrapped 
solution: NoProviderError {message: "No provider for AuthHttp! (App -> AuthHttp)", stack: "Error: DI Exception    at NoProviderError.BaseExc…tp://localhost:3001/polyfills.bundle.js:14833:11)", keys: Array[2], injectors: Array[2]}. roxcity: you haveauthHttp:AuthHttpas parameter in the constructor of yourAppcomponent. You need to addAuthHttpto the providers list inbootstrap(App, [HTTP_PROVIDERS, ... AuthHttp]). 

issue: how EventEmitter can be sync? it's event emitter - when event is generated it's generated... 
solution: I thought event should be delivered when it's emitted, but maybe I just don't know something. nevermind. 

issue: how to pass more than 20 Injectable class in constructor how to resolve that dependancy 
solution: robwormald: I have created  some services and trying to add them in one class. 

issue: How can I set an@Inputalias in a constructor? e.g [<-CODE->] ^that doesn't work,Declaration expected 
solution: 

issue: How i can add - jwt for angular2-webpack-starter 
solution: 

issue: angular2 have any UI framework ? 
solution: angular2 material is in the making. now ,I just use ng2-material. but components and features not enough. 

issue: how do i build an ng2 app for deploying to a web server? 
solution: (but yeah for the provider list). move all those providers up to the array in your bootstrap. 

issue: how do I pass this  [<-CODE->] as input parameter in a component currently it breaks 
solution: I think it takes 'Personal Details Page' as an expression whereas is a hardcoded string. 

issue: Anyone working with animations in angluar2? 
solution: robertbrower: no, not at least with the official tools since they are still bit work in progress as far as I have understood it. 

issue: is it a large project? 
solution: a proof of concept. avg of 2. 

issue: I've got a brand new MBP and it's still 6+ seconds 
solution: yeah I don't think the machine is the problem either, others on my team have good machines and still bitch. 

issue: o k 
solution: 

issue: How does one refer to a local file on plunker? 
solution: 

issue: Hello! If I'm looking to test a component that gets a service injected via the constructor, can I just provide a mock for the service itself so that I can focus on the actual component? [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] (Ping @juliemr :)) 
solution: 

issue: What is the recommended Angular 2 generator ATM? 
solution: johnTurknett: would love to know that too. 

issue: In typesript you don’t have to implement that method as an interface, but it’s best practise to do so right? 
solution: if you don't implement it, your editor may mark it as unused.. 

issue:  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: did you tried to use AfterViewInit? 
solution: you can implement AfterViewInit for your component, and just subscribe to your request in this method. 

issue: Hi guys,  in order to use Rx.DOM.fromWebSocket I need to install this package seperately? 
solution: You have to import it fromrxjs/add/observable/dom/webSocket, note too that you must have at least rxjs beta.1. 

issue: weekly meeting notes? 
solution: yup. I would like more details, but it's something (insert meme here). sparse.. at least soemthing. Ahhh, I see now. 

issue: A request like a http request? 
solution: ericmartinezr: another question, for example if I have 5 components, all of them uses the sameservice.tsfile, should my service be global or I still need to import it manually in each component. 

issue: how can i Put a function on the global scope? 
solution: 

issue: Good morning everyone When you starting a rather big app today with ng2. What data store would you recommend? ngRx? Better sayed, what pattern 
solution: datoml: There is no very big difference between the redux pattern and that on rxjs as for me. If you would write it “the right way” you will get pure functions that handle your business logic in both aproaches. 

issue: I’ve had great success with Ionic in 1.x But if you already have an app@sunshineojust use cordova. if you’re building from scratch Ionic is a solid choice 
solution: For Meteor, I don't need the DDP feature provided by Meteor (which is an awesome feature and I can't wait to try it on my next project). I probably don't need the framework aspect of Meteor either. I have a very simple nodejs server does 2 things: serves the static file and proxy frontend traffic to backend Parse service. It’s probably too complicated to learn Meteor.. 

issue: IS putting [directive] on host permitted like so?  [<-CODE->] 
solution: I asked the ask same host question earlier today. 

issue: hm.. nope, absolutely no clue how to do this 
solution: I need to call myFunc with object from each of the items. there's aforEachoperator as well, if that makes more sense. 

issue: and what do I do with that to get my array filtered? map over it, filter by indexes or something? 
solution: In that case shouldn'tfilterin Rob's example?. 

issue: i have question related to expressjs and angular 
solution: hahaha okay i have a template with twitter bootstrap and angular but express using jade as a template engine right ?i m wondering how to integrate my template to work with express. 

issue: push it where? 
solution: 

issue: Is there any consensus on the best way to redirect to a login component if a user isn't authorized? @CanActivatedoesn't seem to cut it 
solution: all the layers just have to implement a request() method, and don't have to also implement get/put/post/etc.... 

issue:  [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: anybody know about my dart dependency injection issue? 
solution: 

issue: You could export an array of them 
solution: @npx yes, i initially also thought that. But today I found this in in the docsIt will work. It's just not a best practice. The bootstrap provider option is intended for configuring and overriding Angular's own preregistered services, such as its routing support.. 

issue: property subscribe doesn't exist on type EventEmitter. ? 
solution: You shouldn' subscribe manually to the EventEmitter. angular2 does that for you. 

issue: HTTP Request returns Observable, right? Why issubscribenot available? 
solution: Jefftopia: I don't know details about project configuration, I don't use TS (only Dart). 

issue: how can i pass my data between parent route and child route without showing them in URL 
solution: like in previous angular 1 ui-router we are creating param object then it will not shown in ur url. 

issue: how to get plunkr template with beta7? is there any ready templates? 
solution: And use dev bundles!. 

issue: hello all [<-LINK->] hello all, i need help at [<-LINK->] 
solution: i want click a menu and open a new tab left side , after that render another html into this new tab.. 

issue: Btw did you have some instant reload? Something that watches when files changes When developing 
solution: I was told to let all that stuff go, but it would really lower the dev time. 

issue: Hello All, Which IDE is best for AngularJS 2 development?? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] template [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: so I betterencapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None. zoechi:  [<-LINK->] can you please confirm it's likely a bug with encapsulation I can report, rather than me doing something wrong. fxck: didn't you say you use encapsulationNone?. 

issue: Hi guys, what's the equivalent of $document in Angular2 ? 
solution: 

issue: everyone knows about angular attack event??  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: :D 
solution: 

issue: Hi everyone, if my component has an@Inputhow do i listen for changes in my controller? 
solution: Jefftopia: ngonchanges fires whenever changedetection is triggered, so if your change detection is configured to fire on changes to inputs (is by default) then yes.. 

issue: Any idea why I get this issue ? [<-LINK->] 
solution: I installed it with jspm. Nek-: not sure then sorry. try cloning it again locally in a new directory and run the same commands as the build server does. 

issue: haven't been around in a while, are the minify bugs still present in beta 8? 
solution: qdouble: they haven't fixed them since beta.1, so yes.... 

issue: that's tricky@nicohartto, but i think the react example is along the lines of what you'd want to do injection is the right way discussion in this issue [<-LINK->] 
solution: basically, there are really two types of components - smart (routable) which inject services, and dumb (reusable) which purely use input/output. if you've used ng1 you might expect scopes to just inherit, they don't anymore, and that's very much on purpose, as stuff gets leaky. 

issue: Hey, guys.  Is it normal, that typeof injector.get(Rand) === "function"? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: soo.... client is in /src, and CanvasComponent is in /src/ts/components? 
solution: well, it can't find your files because the paths are wrong.. 

issue: I have a question regarding polymer. If I’m using the standard Angular polyfills do I need to include the polymer polyfills (I’m just using the paper elements) 
solution: 

issue: Can anyone integrate Angular 2 with TypeScript into AdminLTE template? 
solution: 

issue: ? 
solution: 

issue: that's javascript my friend the baseURL is likely breaking it 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] not sure this solves your problems... 
solution: 

issue: does typescript have a slice or string functions? a : stringa.slice(-1); 
solution: ndcunningham: well. "does not transpile well" - example needed, and types are stripped down on compilation, they are not for runtime (not like Flow). 

issue: so just want to make sure but it’s by design that we cannot access the context of a directive, from inside a component view? Directives only manipulate DOM. This is my first impression of the difference. I am trying to add a simple dropdown directive and have the view read a value that determines if its open or not to add the class. Instead of manipulating the class property on the element. nevermind figured it out. looks like exportAs was the answer I needed. 
solution: zoechi: thanks for taking the time. Yes, I was also trying to solve another problem of getting a new instances for all consumers of the DI class - I discovered that childcomponents can_achieve this, but couldn't find a way to achieve this in a service hierarchy. I still think I am trying to use it the wrong way. The constructor config thing - I was trying to find a way to pass config that the component constructor would have - but the class in instantiated before this point, and so it seems in both cases (forcing a new instance in child services or passing constructor config from the parent constructor), if you want to do this you would have to build your own factory provider class and pass this around with DI - then you can pass run time constructor config, and create new instances as per your requirements. But it really feels like Im trying to push a square peg through a round hole - so I must be working to an anti pattern.. 

issue: do you have multiple instances of that emitter for each instance that wants to subscribe to it? Or do you want them all subscribed to the same observable? 
solution: <tag-new (newTag$)="createTextTag($event)" [modalClickStream]="modalClickStream"></tag-new><tag-date [memory]="memory" (newTag$)="memory.date = $event" [modalClickStream]="modalClickStream"></tag-date><tag-location [memory]="memory" (newTag$)="memory.location = $event" [modalClickStream]="modalClickStream"></tag-location>. you may want to create a Subject, subscribe it to modalClickStream, and then subscribe each component to that subject.. 

issue: In Angular2? What’s the benefits of including styles inline in a component vs including a css? 
solution: bryanl: If by css you mean the one referenced by the "styles" property on the component, then there is no technical difference between that or the inline one.  If the css is on the hosting html page, then there is a difference.. bryanl: If css is inline or referenced in styles of component, then by default angular 2 will encapsulate it.  Meaning that it will add some tags to the html and css so that the styles only apply to that component.  You can turn this off by adding a encapsulation:ViewEncapsulation.None.. 

issue: wait what lol 
solution: 

issue: how can i control which class is used on a div: [<-CODE->] where onoffState is a boolean ? 
solution: and now it's camel cased. 

issue: any knows? 
solution: 

issue: i have a jar of dirt? :P 
solution: I think angular internally uses OpaqueTokens for resolving... that might be constructable with that string. 

issue: Is there a way I can get “routeParams” inside of CanActivate? 
solution: basically I have user roles that can access some content and can’t some other content. And I get that information based on an API call.. 

issue: can't you put PostsCmp as part of directives of PageCmp? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: dchacke:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: gerne :). 

issue: What does "Can\'t bind to \'placeholder\' since it isn\'t a known native property” mean? [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: escardin: question to you: if you were going to write a directive that turned an html element (say H2) into a contentEditable type input with additional dom stuff added, would you write an attribute directive or a structural directive ?. 

issue: Can I solicit opinions here? ;) 
solution: 

issue: Is there no easy way to access route params of a parent route in a child? 
solution: hworld: no built-in way. You can use a service to share data between routes. And I\'m guessing that would be the same way to handle the whole "nested route scopes" that ui-router does? Where you can access data in parent templates in child ones. Just have a service that is shared and modify/use in parent/children?. 

issue: how do import FS or CRYPTO from node within a service? 
solution: alxhub: no man, I'm building an Electron app,  it prompts for directories and cryptographies files. 

issue: Hiya, I have a probably very basic question, what is the significance of '$' in: [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: so question if you had [<-CODE->] that you wanted to then take that and wrap it with a parent tag what is the preferred approach ? 
solution: probably more useful to saywhyyou want to wrap it in another parent - what are you trying to achieve? You can for instance hook into the host. 

issue: is there something like ng-init on Angular2? 
solution: fxck: i asking abt #ngInit in template part. 

issue: Can some one tell how do I create Dictionary object in Anguler2 
solution: TheVelourFog: i too faced the same issue, refer the docs, they have mentioned this. Also if you are passing the component name dynamically, if you are successful can you tell me how to do it? It requires class name, if you pass variable name it takes it as a string. 

issue: Hi...what's the best approach to deal with authentication for angularjs and django? 
solution: puneetagg: Imo use jwt and the rest module for your backend and disable the xsrf tokens. don't use django's templates, just have it serve up static stuff. 

issue: mister@vikerman, please submit changelog OR THERE IS NO CHANGES IN NEW BETA? 
solution: it\'s rules of IonicAs I need to ship app in 3 days, I\'ll have to accept their rules this timeI did it, and even in 1 day, not 3. So not all is so bad as I thought with Ionic. Although on devices their design looks too "default".. 

issue: The fix I was waiting for hasn’t fixed anything, fixed 2 weeks ago and still not in I know, doesn’t stop it being frustrating issues marked “P1”, “easy, 1 hour” and months old != good and reassuring 
solution: 

issue: anyone know good tutorials/explanations about typings? i wanna know more about what are browser and main folders, etc 
solution: 

issue: any thoughts as to why my custom component,UIDropdownCompisn't having itsng-validandng-invalidset correctly when loaded up? [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: any ideas with what I said in mind? 
solution: alxhub: I have a element focused, I delete the input that is in that element, and then tab to the next element.. 

issue: ugh seriously angular2 should throw and exception when one does an@Inputinstead of@Input() 
solution: 

issue: so you think http post problem is because of angular 2 version? it is really expensive for me to upgrade to new version. 
solution: A-Kamaee: @CaptainCodemanI am of the mind that if you’re doing real work on Angular2, you want to try to stay up to date with each beta rather than let yourself fall behind as breaking changes come in.. 

issue: I see@CaptainCodemanYou’re adding the polyfills and es6 files right in HTML eh? That works okay for you? 
solution: it uses a polyfill service to fix IE and Safari issues, the es6-shim is only in there because of one last IE issue but otherwise that shouldn’t be needed. angular2-polyfills is still added into the bundle (that has the zone + metadata stuff you were referencing). I had issues trying to use the starters that did it that way. 

issue: Hi...in Beta.9 there has been support for outlets in dynamic components.I  have made a demo here [<-LINK->] where the component is been loaded dynamically and has an outlet.But it is not working as expected.Somebody please suggest me how to make outlet work for dynamic components 
solution: zoechi: Here are the steps which i am trying to do->1.When the page loads since the user is not logged in so  login component will be loaded dynamically.2.After that when user finishes login then appcomponent will be loaded dynamically.And AppComponent consists of the router links and outlet...I can see the links but when i click the link content is not loading in outlet. 

issue: can some see any problem with this  [<-CODE->] 
solution: You could try to injectconstructor(private zone:NgZone);and then [<-CODE->]. 

issue: at runtime or compiletime? 
solution: that means your import path is incorrect. 

issue: FelipeMonobe: still around? 
solution: so in electron, because it supports commonJS modules, you don't really need the system loader. the other thing is I would avoid using dots in the name of your files, personally. 

issue: Hi, whats the best way to deal with circular dependency 
solution: shankarregmi: Just don't. If you have a circular dependency, rethink your architecture.. 

issue: module moduleResolution is about how tsc will locate your source files. module is about what kind of modules it will produce 
solution: I feel like I’m barking up the wrong tree here throwing BrowserDomAdapter at the problem, but I’ve been adding whatever the framework seemed to want as it complained first about DirectiveResolve then ViewResolver being absent. Then it was bombing because utils DOM Adapter was missing its DOM object… and now I’ve got an undefined document. I think I must be trying to set this up incorrectly.. 

issue: My browser does about 600 requests per page when I use SystemJS. It's boring 
solution: this.headers = new Headers();this.headers.set('Content-Type', 'multipart/form-data');. 

issue: poke: , what are you inheriting? 
solution: 

issue: D 
solution: 

issue: yep, is the equivalent inputs : ['myInput'] === @Input() myInput exactly 
solution: and if I wanted to check whether attribute simply is defined on the component, instead of passing it a value?. You can do that, the same way, but for what I just tested passed as an empty string. 

issue: If someone is good in writing directives [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Is there some life-cycle event or something else I can attach to to figure out when the current router navigates somewhere else? 
solution: poke: ngOnDestroyor you can subscribe to router and detect every navigation.. 

issue: Hi All, which one is better html or jade with angular2.0? 
solution: 

issue: for the 'google' thing adddeclare var google: anyin the top of your file at least there are typings for google maps lib 
solution: Ckearns1210: , you need to wait for Angular to actually stamp out the DOM before you can use the reference to the<input>. So duringngOnInitthere's no DOM yet.ngAfterViewInitis called after the DOM is created and yourViewChildreference is populated.. 

issue: angular2 errors are so incredibly helpful 
solution: 

issue:  [<-ISSUE->] ahaha, lol... we have been asking for the same for a long time, but batarangle team asked for it so they have to do it 
solution: todoubaba: yeah, I think I'm going to buy a t-shirt with Google stamped on it and put it as my profile picture or something. 

issue: This is how the node module is organised: [<-CODE->] 
solution: LPalmito: look at this file [<-LINK->]. 

issue: For the@Attributedecorator to a directive, is there a way to get a default value for an attribute in case one isn't given in the template? 
solution: 

issue: Can I upgrade attribute directive from angular1 to 2 using ngUpgrade? 
solution: ( I don't know if you can, but I would just see). I have tool directive that makes some dom manipulations and it's a attribute directive. 

issue: no 
solution: 

issue: I'm building a search form and I'd like to get notified when any of the values change so I can perform some action, preferably using observables. How could I do this? 
solution: Though it applies to controlgroups and  control arrays equally, so if you want to do something every time your form changes (and is still valid) you can use the same technique.. 

issue: No errors but is this valid [<-CODE->] TWO annotations 
solution: It attaches priority to each type of path. I believe static paths get top priority, followed by dynamic paths, then catchall paths. 

issue: I have been following the official guide ("tour of heroes"), how can I build/deploy the whole project? 
solution: ComFreek: if you don't want to stray from system, you need to use something like systembuilder to asseble your dependencies and then you put the whole thing on your http server (what http server, whatever, backends, etc... is out of scope). 

issue: anyone have some nice sort pipe? 
solution: fxck: the reason they didn't sort or filter in pipes was it was better accomplished in your code. I found it to be true when using observables.. 

issue: I've only seen Brad talk, is Bryan's there too? 
solution:  [<-LINK->] there won't be router for a while. ericmartinezr: I created this plnkr [<-LINK->] mybe you want have a look. Hahaha!. 

issue: We sort of know that but don't really care@christopherthielen 
solution: Internally it's often called null safe. You could submit a PR to docs to change it, but it's wayyyy down the list of priorities. like, yes, you used the fat arrow syntax there, but it may compile to the wrong context anyway.. 

issue: What about forcing lowercase in your select? [<-CODE->] 
solution: ericmartinezr: Just so I can understand ngModel better -- it'll match EITHER the {{myValue}} OR the [value] to the variable specified as the model?. it uses the value of the select field, and since you didn't provide a default value in your previos example it seems like it takes the value you passed and assigns it to the value, but that must be a html thing. 

issue: What do you guys use for error feedback to the user? 
solution: More because i don't want to make a hidden field on each page and then show hide it. 

issue: I think it’s unreasonable to expect them to support every conceivable js build and packaging system 
solution: there’s a new js tool every 5 minutes and even taking just one of them like webpack, there are lots of different approaches to using it. 

issue: Anyone know if it's possible to use Angular 2 with ES6 classes but without using decorators? 
solution: 

issue: triple backticks 
solution: I am using canReuse:routerCanReuse(next: ComponentInstruction, prev: ComponentInstruction) { return true; }. well that will be why... you're not getting a new instance of the component (because it's being re-used...). 

issue: Hi! someone upgrade to beta.10 ? 
solution: 

issue: How come the compiler doesn't/can't detect that the values aren't immutable? 
solution: mmort75: also storing a reference to the observer like that is a big anti-pattern. crowder: if you want to use mutable values you just setpure: falsein your pipe config. 

issue: if you log in the constructor, is it being fired each time you navigate? 
solution: Also, I have another question with the same code base. The hook NgOnit of a Component, should be always fired?. after the call of the constructor, right?. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Does this inspire you ? x) 
solution: that means you're loading an import that's 404'ing. if you are importing reflect-metadata, don't - use the angular-polyfills.js file and include it in a script tag. 

issue: y 
solution: 

issue: what is 'platform' and why should I care about it? [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: vectom: probably not, as its our internal meeting 
solution: robwormald: have you got a simple 'production capable' system js starter/template? I believe I saw your pokedex project, which seemed reasonable. The mgechev one is great, but really complex for someone who just wants to build a redistributable.. 

issue: what do I use to update value in form builder? I’m raging so hard right now 
solution: 

issue: brandonroberts:  [<-ISSUE->] He says in master, no idea what version is that 
solution: 

issue: can I choose component template dynamically? 
solution: you should think of a component as the base unit of angular2. 

issue: I think [value] doesn’t play well along ngControl@PascalPrecht or maybe it didn’t before I don’t know 
solution: 

issue: combinelatest  is in both operator and observable  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] no idea the difference isn't combinelatest the same as forkJoin? 
solution: 

issue: Did somebody remove@Viewdecorator - and not bother to mention it in the changelog? 
solution: 

issue: templateUrlneeds some TLC before 1.0 final, I think 
solution: it seems like the definite preferred-way of the angular team is inlinetemplateinstead oftemplateUrl. spencerwi: that's because their plan is to precompile templates, rather than what$templateCachedid.. 

issue: screw ng1 :P i have an ng2 job now :P 
solution: it’s a nice place, but it’s porn, most people won’t touch that; personally it’s the nicest most open minded bunch i’ve ever worked with. better than most startups where the whole idea is to stress out like crazy so that someone buys your company, relying only on VC… here they make money regardless :P. 

issue: I believe .filter is a function on an Observable, so why is [<-LINK->] giving a 'is not a function' error?  Trying to upgrade [<-LINK->] from the talk someone referenced earlier today. 
solution: andycwk: thx.  haven't used Observables (at least explicitly) before.  That addressed the error.  Now just need to figure out why it is not working.. 

issue: how would I replace the content of the tab elements with the contents of a template file? 
solution: TheSaturn: I mean, I want the HTML markup that appears inside the <tab> elements to get loaded from a file. 

issue: ericmartinezr: Just saw this. That's super cool - thank you! Hey guys can you bind to ngModel's changes, or do you just have to go FormControl at that point? 
solution: harangue: you bind to the events of that element.. harangue: If your using the form builder you can also subscribe to state and value changes via code.. see [<-LINK->]. 

issue: How do I define multiple parameters in route? e.g /client/:clientId, clientName 
solution: pantonis: there is a typo in your component name (I assume) - "Cl-ei-ntComponent" and I think to separate params you need to use a slash (but better check the docu on that) so for example path would be: \'/client/:clientId/:clientName\'. 

issue: how long have you guys been in industry? 
solution: domfarolino: Time served isn't always a good indicator ;). is that 10 years doing the same thing that was cutting edge 15 years ago :D. 

issue: is there any way to do a sort pipe  ? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] 
solution: ericmartinezr: I redid the faq to have tables of contents and be better organised [<-LINK->]. I gotta jet, but I'll fix the busted links and list nesting in the morning. 

issue: how do you sort it then before the data get's to the view ? 
solution: 

issue: is there a prize for most packages? I feel like a real slacker now 
solution: I am pretty sure that guy is a robot, or his brain is suspended in a jar and he can code 24/7. this is a family friendly channel, please refrain from referring to .jar files. thanks.. 

issue: If we need name of passed model instead of value how we can achieve this ?For example@Input() field: any;<one-line [title]="\'Last Name\'" [(field)]="doc.lastName"></one-line>My requirement is to have "doc.lastName" (anything which passed in field) not the value of doc.lastNameWe can say similar to  Angular1scope:{fieldName:\'@field\'} 
solution: If we need name of passed model instead of value how we can achieve this ?For example@Input() field: any;<one-line [title]="\'Last Name\'" [(field)]="doc.lastName"></one-line>My requirement is to have "doc.lastName" (anything which passed in field) not the value of doc.lastNameWe can say similar to Angular1scope:{fieldName:\'@field\'}. 

issue: Cannot find module 'angular2/platform/browser' and 'angular2/core' while debugging on Visual studio.. anybody got this earlier? 
solution: 

issue: harangue: how can I prevent the app from reloading when I change the URL in the browser ?. 
solution: jkristia: You need to make sure all of your routes direct to your index.html page. Most default setups with Webpack-dev-server and such will do that for you.. 

issue: hey all. is there a way to pass a observable from one component to another via a service? 
solution: 

issue: OK.  I'll try a narrower question... how to add HTML to elementRef.nativeElement?  In Attribute Directive, want to add a floating div to the inputbox.  Should I be using Renderer instead of elementRef? 
solution: vojtapol: probably will use dcl for some part of this, but for this specific piece elementRef suits.@escardinWill have a look at Renderer.  thx.  Will put together plunker and post for other better implementation ideas.... 

issue:  [<-CODE->] 
solution: gionkunz: yeah, that's what I have been doing. It gets weird sometimes, when you subscribe to something within the test, expecting it to wait for the subscribe, but the test just finishes without waiting for it.. tallkid24: You need to return your final observable stream as a Promise from your test function decorated with injectAsync. tallkid24: I think they are working on something that will use the Zones to detect asynchronous operations initiated within the test and wait for those to complete automatically. 

issue: Hi all,Just updated from beta 6 to beta 12 and run into the following error,/angular2/core"\' has no exported member \'View\'.does anyone know if this module has been moved from the core? 
solution: 

issue: is subscription to an observable a blocking operation? 
solution: hmm... that's what i figured. i'm getting blocking behavior in an interface and i'm not quite sure what's going on. is there anything obvious in this snippet? [<-CODE->] it's an app that creates printers on remote servers. the add can take up to 2.5 minutes, and i'd like the queue interface to be usable in the meantime. I'm tying parts of an individual printer's state to the results of an observable and then pushing that onto the stack. while a printer add is going on, though, the on-click functionality in my queue doesn't work - the zippy isn't expanding.. 

issue: Does anyone use JSONAPI with Angular?  I'm looking for an example of converting a JSONAPI response into an object the 'Angular2' way. 
solution: I\'m new to this, and am looking for the \'right way\' to structure my API payloads ( so far I"m looking at JSONAPI but need advice ). 

issue: So there’s an operator that’s poisoning the whole rxjs/Rx well then? 
solution: 

issue: harangue: are you certain that the page background processes aren\'t just being throttled making it "appear" as if you have to give it focus first? 
solution: 

issue: harangue: you were having that issue with the EventEmitter<{}> ? 
solution: 

issue: ok. it is not related to what i said. when the tsc runs after a file changes, it compiles a the file in a different way which cause this errors 
solution: 

issue: robwormald: in looking at [<-LINK->] you include reflect-metadata but not zone.js…. is that what I should do for karma unit tests? 
solution: which was one reason I’m on core-js instead. Let me see if I can go toward what you have there but with core-js and put it just about the polyfills. 

issue: TheSaturn: do you import Observable and map from rxjs ? 
solution: can you try addingimport 'rxjs/Rx';. 

issue: define "normal" 
solution: I thought on the website is not full documentation about framework. For example, such situiation was with first version of angular. Yes, there is a great API, but conception wasn't described fully.. Carl-fridrix-zendolf-IV: first of all, you have to inject your components/directives indirectivesproperty, not inproviders. Second, if you want to access your children, in this case is enough with@ViewChild(QuestionTextComponent) qTextCmp, then inngAfterViewInityou can access it and change whatever you want in there. 

issue: Is there any ways to preload controllers and templates? 
solution: AngryPowman: though it hasn't landed yet, they're going to use angular cli to precompile all your templates into js that can be bundled. in the meantime you can use thetemplatefor inline templates and webpack can require the template file for you. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] claims to be a component test. is it working? is it angular 2? i have no idea. :/ 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys, i have a questions. How to pass a Json  between components? 
solution: Baldho: i just worked through something similar.... i have a main component that loads some data and the 'detail' view changes when a property on the main component changes.. [<-LINK->] (running live here, though not much to look at yet: [<-LINK->] ). 

issue: is there any books on angularjs2 ? good practices and patterns? yet 
solution: DrMabuse23: Looks like anngIf and anngFor on the same elemnt is a no-go xD. 

issue: I started trying the ngUpgrade approach - so many issues with it that it wasn’t worth bothering wth. Material components also didn’t work with it. Better to just segment the app into NG1/NG2 endpoints IMO or bite the bullet and re-write 
solution: yeah, all I can do it tell people from my experience, ngUpgrade is not worth it. IMO it was to pacify the people screaming about ng2 not being ng1.6. 

issue: I told you@escardin 
solution: ericmartinezr: yeah yeah, regressions are all my fault.. I am genuinely excited. beta 13 should clear up the zone issues. Responses on the mangling issues are great, even if the timeline is unfortunate.. we’ve just come through a bad period of lots of breakages - I think a bit of levity about it is not such a bad thing. Surely better that people care than not. 

issue: for forms validation what defines valid 
solution: pantonis: if it isn't valid it returns an object with the error name and the error message. 

issue: you don’t need crypto  [<-CODE->] 
solution: It’s not that crypto is built in, it’s that that remnant of dependency isn’t needed to make angualr2-polyfills work. I’m not the world’s expert on systemjs and jspm, but I learned the@emptytrick in this context with a pointer from@robwormaldto the jspm overrides for angular, which kind of make a statement as to what you do and don’t need to get angular going:. 

issue: why not,@CaptainCodeman? 
solution: 

issue: debug with js(you can use es6 with module solution), not typescript tuanquynet: can't see route config  [<-LINK->] 
solution: xsilen: : maybe you need AsyncRouter not DynamicComponentLoader. If you need to know RouterConfig please refer to this tutorial [<-LINK->]. 

issue: this should work but it's usually better to assign the result of the function to a field and bind to the field instead 
solution: Doesn't sound like a good idea and will also lead to such errors if you bind to the property as well. 

issue: How do I subscribe to selections in an html<select>in A2? 
solution: bind a control to it and do control.valueChanges.subscribe(). escardin: Moving the selector into a@Directive({ selector: "tr[usersummary]") seems to quiet the gripe, but I am now not seeing the elements render. 

issue: no b.13? 
solution: 

issue: which one - .of ? 
solution: That's hilarious.. I think this is a difference between of and from. the first takes an argument as a plain data. FROM tries to iterate it... well, something like that. 

issue: texel: what are your primary pain points with ui-router? 
solution: That comes down to bad design not necessarily ui-router's fault, but trying to share some code between ng1 and ng2, and trying to decouple the app state, views, controllers, and routing is kind of mind bending. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] this is my main.js 
solution: 

issue: sweet, new router? will definitely be looking at this! 
solution: In case any ideas can be factored in / are even possible. Basically the gist is to try and have the router use as many of the ng2 component lifecycle and param passing mechanisms as possible instead of creating new, overlapping methods. 

issue: webtrix: upload problem solved ;) 
solution: and now i can upload file from angular2 app to a Spring Rest Webservice to Amazon S3 Perfectly :). 

issue: So how can i cancel that xhr ? 
solution: but the request was made at some point. like i do with xhr.abort(). 

issue: Does anyone have a tip for styling directives? 
solution: escardin: I tried to use a component to add a style and in that component but the style did not transfer over. Should I let the style spill over with viewEncapsulation?. Luidog: no, I think that defeats the purpose of having styling on the component.. 

issue: Can a service.ts also have an oninit? I tried yesterday but it wasnt fired? 
solution: 

issue: routerOnActivate is called on init but i cant see elements in select. what could be the problem ?code: [<-CODE->] template [<-CODE->] 
solution: CaptainCodeman: - can you clarify what you mean -angular2 has support for hammer if it loads- I assume you mean, it's loaded by index html or other means. Is it swipeleft attached in code through an elementref or is there a template binding of sorts that I could use.. 

issue: Hi, does anyone know how to group by model elements in the view ? 
solution: escardin: for example in my model we have an array of notifications, each one has a type and in my view I want to display these notifications group by notification.type (in a header). 

issue: hero power list is empty? 
solution: It\'s like you can\'t use the #templatevariable things before they are declared on ngControl="". 

issue: is there a way not animate in angular2 already? like.. fading in a panel or something like this? 
solution: Rian0702: you don't need to use *ngIf in that case, but [ngClass]. 

issue: _.groupBy 
solution: DrMabuse23: I should have just looked it up. I haven't really needed underscore. I think there's some es5/6 builtins as well.. not underscore. DrMabuse23: whichever. I keep forgetting which is the one you're supposed to use these days. and its very nice on loads because you can only install groupBy. 

issue: hello there! any idea why i get the following error in chrome? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: can i change [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: webtrix: yes, i have, i want to create a gradle task to compile all ts files. for that im using library, and when compiling, i get these errors. 

issue: hey is there a dude with Namespace experience ? 
solution: so this is my Namespace module [<-LINK->]. but it looks for me crazy. usage works very well [<-LINK->] but it feels incorrect. 

issue: does it include typings? can I import modules from it? 
solution: fxck: i am new to typescript so ... yes there are typescript definition files and yes you can import a module like "import * as moment from \'moment\';". fxck: yeah, it's not ideal. and it loads all the localizations unless you tell webpack not to.. 

issue: is super() the same as parent. in PHP ? 
solution: @webtrix, @DrMabuse23 cheap viagra no sms:-Dofftopers :). DrMabuse23: not really.... 

issue: there is an upload component, valour ?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: a lot depends on where you are uploading too as well. I do some image resizing / re-encoding before pushing resumable uploads to google storage, most components are still focused on chunked uploading to AWS. 

issue: These TypeScript compile time messages are very helpful I have to say as a newbie 
solution: I really wish you could get them in views too.. 

issue: Oh my webstorm handles template strings nicely now 
solution: All I need is a more heat resistant table. if it makes the fans on my macbook come on and it's not a game I don't like it. 

issue: I have a better idea now of how ui-router is approaching the ng1+ng2 support 
solution: kind of ironic that you can't use interfaces ... part of the point of DI. 

issue: check he network tab - is it actually being sent the javascript expected or an html page instead. That will often cause the "unexpected \'<\'" error 
solution: CaptainCodeman: it is showing up asbutton.jsin the network tab and appears in the XHR filter as well in the network tab. 

issue: anyone know why webpack would create all the module contents wrapped in an eval("") 
solution: that might be one of the settings you played with, LOL. Good to experiment to see what the pieces do. 

issue: is core-js a requirement for angular2? 
solution: They are in the index.html file - I load from a seervice / CDN. 

issue: vscode 
solution: DrMabuse23: i wonder if theres a way to hide the generated .js + .map files - as it makes the file list in the ide very busy. 

issue: So I have a Folder that has a list of children. [<-CODE->] These are rendered in view: [<-CODE->] selecting even changes URL / reuses component: [<-CODE->] Then node ... 
solution: CaptainCodeman: this is a simple enough example where component recursion wouldn't be necessary. Since my use case has large logic/ui sections surrounding the portions that are recursive it sort of breaks down.. I would treat those logic blocks as like a mini tree - sounds like a hierarchy, just with different types. Maybe limits of what can be children of what. 

issue: if I have a component class (decorated with@Component), is there a way for me to get the@Inputorinputs: []? 
solution: emilaasa: I think I found it...Reflect.getMetadata('propMetadata', ContactComponent). 

issue: If you have a component where you pass data like this<mycomponent [data]="customer" />when in the lifecycle of themycomponentclass is the data available? 
solution: So I am passing incustomervia the<my-component [customer]="customer"/>and at some point in the future then its available for me to assign to my form fields.. 

issue: I\'m having trouble with radio buttons. I have two radio buttons using the same name and [(ngModel)]="value". When I select a button, I get an error:angular2-polyfills.js:267 Uncaught EXCEPTION: Error during evaluation of "change"ORIGINAL EXCEPTION: TypeError: Cannot read property \'value\' of undefinedI couldn\'t find any definitive answers for using radio buttons with ngModel.https://plnkr.co/edit/OF4Hiv0fUPiL72mRPXD0 
solution: 

issue: I'm getting the wrongoffsetTopvalue when I'm trying to get it using an attribute directive, any idea why? [<-CODE->] 
solution: I am struggling to get even typescript adapted in my team forget about Angular2. 

issue: yes, best practice - but there isn’t inherently different that causes a function to be checked more than a field / property? 
solution: 

issue: can someone give an example of how to flatten (chain) angular 2 promises 
solution: 

issue: do ws messages cause change detection? 
solution: This is kinda cool, I've got this state tree on the server that is using node streams to pipe right through ws and updating state tree on the client.. 

issue: why do you think that makes sense? Isn’t that state directly related to that component 
solution: CaptainCodeman: it is, until you want to draw the waveform separately from the play/pause button. But they'd still need another object that manages playback state that they talk to. 

issue: Correct.getMe()will only ever make the http call once as a result. Which is fine in this circumstance. 
solution: when loading the service you’ll checlk local storage for a saved token and that will be your first user state OR either a null or null-pattern (preferred) object to represent an unauthenticated user. 

issue: whats the error you were getting? So your config file is in theconfigfolder? 
solution: 

issue: for SimpleChange, how do you get the previousValue? 
solution: zachrip:  [<-LINK->] ?? Should be pretty clear if you know how to use simplechange. 

issue: urge to find very tall animated gif growing … must … resist … urge … evil 
solution: 

issue: i like the strictness of ng2 just typescript makes me sad, the typescript compiler rather 
solution: escardin: I cannot for the life of me get theonFormChangefunction to fire in mymy-buttonscomponent. 

issue: is there something similar to response interceptors in angular 2? 
solution: I’m not sure, I haven’t looked into it honestly. I want to transform every response object, the API we’re working with returns a lot of crap data we don’t need.. just a second, mby i can find a quick implementation(if the interceptor is used, i dunno). 

issue: Don’t bind to functions 
solution: Binding to a function is what’s making it be evaluated multiple times during change detection. Bind to a property and update the property. that would be my guess - i am guessing with property binding you are just not seeing it. It stops it. If you have to turn on prod mode during development, it usually means you’re doing something you shouldn’t be doing. 

issue: Is there a way I can pass inputs into a component inserted in a<router-outlet>? 
solution: You write a<some-fancy-view-wrapper>component which has as a template<some-fancy-view input="X">, and use that for the route instead.. alxhub: @CaptainCodemanOk, so basically I need the component to have inputs of information specific to a currently logged in user. Seeing as how I have a service that can give that information I guess it seems more logical (and easy) to take advantage of that in this case, as the wrapping or subclassing seems to be too much for this situation. 

issue: Guys, why isrouterOnReusereturningnext.paramsas the previous one when I navigate without params? the url doesn't even display params but reuse is still getting them :( 
solution: brandonroberts: can't really reproduce, but basically I callthis.router.navigate([currentComponent])without any params, and therouterOnReusestill has params innext.params. knifir: I’ve had similar things, some of the params are repeated in different parts of the instruction and I seem to recall I needed to set some things to null / recreate them to use the instruction. 

issue: Can someone explain why typescript is complaining it can't find theRemSvcmodule: [<-LINK->] 
solution: I remember hearing that I should always specify it from the root path, googling the details as we speak ! :). 

issue: sweet beta.0... memories 
solution: Can it be that it was all so simple then? Or has time re-written every line?. CaptainCodeman: I did a various test and I discovered that the partial problem is the width of the div that it contains (Map).. 

issue: are the radio buttons working on beta-12? I\'m using them like this<input type="radio" [ngFormControl]="attrForm.controls[\'servicetype\']" name="servicetype" value="Internal"> 
solution: alxhub: <input type="radio" [ngFormControl]="attrForm.controls[\'servicetype\']" name="servicetype" value="Internal"> <input type="radio" [ngFormControl]="attrForm.controls[\'servicetype\']" name="servicetype" value="External">. 

issue: o oh I see the typings 
solution: GarrettVD: as i said, im very new at angular2 and javascript frameworks, this is a demo/learning project. 

issue: Don't you have to return after the expect? 
solution: or remove the curly braces, then it’s an implied return. it's a good pattern to always return insidethen()- andcatch(), for that matter. 

issue: Is it possible to inject a service into a value class ? How? a service fetches them from database yes, isn't it possible somehow? or should i pre -add this value on server-side? 
solution: If you have something calculated from it then that method could go onto the class but it’s a lot of effort for no real gain (you can’t just cast to an interface), easier to pass the value into a service or do the calc and add the property as part of the loading. 

issue: how to implement ngOnChanges(chnages:{[propName:string]:SimpleChange}) for an input box ? 
solution: robertbrower: so on change of input variable event should be caught in ngOnChanges. 

issue: Own apps hmmm interesting, you got some PaaS things going then? 
solution: I love the cloud, means zero time spent managing servers and useless persuits, more time coding. have another one but not as finished, going to experient using polymer on it. 

issue: I'm having trouble deciding how to add an element to the DOM with a click event. Not sure if I don't have the right query or what. Any recommendation? 
solution: 

issue: how about posting your code where you\'re missing the ";" ? 
solution: 

issue: i need to make a fake account so i can come here and bitch :/ 
solution: 

issue: will there be previews or will all these things just land with RC? 
solution: so http in ng2 currently will remain and then be deprecated sometime after RC? what timeline is that going to happen?. 

issue: How I can pass values through service? [<-CODE->] I am a long time trying to do this.. 
solution: I would like to set values in the breadcrumb through the services to communicate between components. you need to refer to the actual name of the thing, not something that doesn’t exist. Aim for consistency. Things likeseTBreadcrumbfor example. 

issue: Angular is designed for SPAs…if you need form submission use fucking jQuery 
solution: and the angular team is “shunning” you by not meeting your needs, instead meeting the needs of large organizations that run apps that have millions of users? pshh.. 

issue: Hey, what's up? 
solution: 

issue: I know of *ngIf, but how iselsedone in Angular2? 
solution: !variablename should be okay, but I may have some more complex expression. 

issue: Hi. What is the best solution to date to display a modal window with angular 2 ? 
solution: lpenet: it’s way too opinionated for me, what I’d like is something completely style-less.. just insert whatever I want, whereever I want a provide me api for removing it. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] is it the best way to get checkbox value on ckeck box click ? 
solution: Lauris01: It might, however, be better to listen on change, depending on what you want to achieve.. 

issue: I wonder if not importing it could somehow be the issue ... 
solution: 

issue: you copied the template I presume? 
solution: and put i in the root folder. so the correct approach would be to make that part of the build (but make the name match the control / location) OR make the template compile in. The latter is preferable because the first will stop being an option (some new required build step will kick in instead). 

issue: you're missing a] 
solution: Not working... TypeError: this.validator is not a function in [initiative inInitiativeComponent@1:69]. This is so I can configure the validation rules in a config file, and get the composed validators to pass into FormBuilder.. 

issue: Have any of you tried to create an Observable from SocketIO events? 
solution: robert52: I mean use the websocket directly instead of socketio and use Observable.fromWebsocket to observe/interact with it.. 

issue: so what's a way to fix up this? 
solution: or use what's in the stack overflow. Type 'Map<any, any>' is not an array type or a string type.at line 67 col 21. 

issue: how do you load script tags when loading a component? they don't compile in templates anymore i guess 
solution: xFailsafeNY: you can’t put scripts in your template. What are you trying to load?. 

issue: is     for (var k in authHeaders) {      this.headers.set(k, authHeaders[k]);    }deprecated ? 
solution: ekarlso: no that looks right, are you sure you don't wantvar k of headers?. 

issue: How to send values with output emitter? 
solution: then you receive it using(myEventEmitter)="useData($event)"$event will holdSome data. 

issue: can anyone point me in the direction in the code of when an input event actually changes the value of the ngModel/Control assigned to it? 
solution: if it is, that alone would be preventing the possibility of ever having support for select multiple.  There needs to be a conditional property check on the element ref to see if it has selectedOptions. 

issue: how do i get the name of the current route? 
solution: i know about Router.currentInstruction but it lacks information about router name. Mig1st4ck: I pasted how I solved it. There are probably better ways.... also i want to implement a back button on a component with childs but show the button only when it is in a child. 

issue: you won't be able to replicate w/ setTimeout, since that'll force a CD run. are you using angular http or something else? 
solution: trynotdoing that, and including the bundles/angular2-polyfills.js file as your first script tag. 

issue: Maarten, did you paste a link to a@ViewChildrenexample yesterday? 
solution: webtrix:. ermm. 

issue: is the console.log printing undefined? 
solution: CaptainCodeman: yes.. thx anyway.. 

issue: Why can't i run .find on a ControlGroup? 
solution: Cronkan: Probably because you are missing the es6-shims.. 

issue: Is it possible to "hide" the base url in the browser path when its not "/" ? 
solution: ericmartinezr: may be my longest post ever. brandonroberts: fyi, extending the the router-outlet works great! [<-LINK->]. brandonroberts: you could link to this [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Good morning, all :) 
solution: If all goes well!. alxhub: so what's in this weeks release?. 

issue: What is wrong in this ? [<-LINK->] error : [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: How can I apply/remove classes from the host of my component? 
solution: robertbrower: you can also usehost: {}property ( the equivalent for HostBinding). I want to apply the flex attribute when the component's active property is true.. 

issue: Ivan: That's between you and your backend ;) We can, however, all agree that php is the bottom of the barrel :P 
solution: 

issue: Since the SystemJS Gitter seems to be deserted at the moment I am trying my luck here.When importing a global resource (non module) the DOM seems not to be patched simply by callingimport "xyz".  This differs from the behavior when ascripttag is used.Does any1 have some insights into this ? 
solution: @gionkunz I am currently trying to remove all my script tags apart from system and some polyfills to be able to bundle my dependencies.While this works: [<-CODE->] This does not: [<-CODE->] Since accounting.js is simply a DOM extension it requires to be executed after the fetch to patch the dom.. 

issue: Has anyone come across any awesome sites using 2.0? 
solution: 

issue: How can I refer to the HTML tag inside of the component? 
solution: ha, although it comes with a big red warning. 

issue: Hello there 
solution: Lauris01: the problem is with yoursortmethod. should look like this: [<-CODE->]. 

issue: how to connect angular2 typescript with node.js ? marr: 
solution: olostan: you should use Opaque tokens if you want ng1 style importing, then you can use interfaces instead of concrete classes.. bmarti44: thx for this one, it already save couple young lives!. 

issue: Huh, does Angular 2 have a mousewheel event directive? 
solution: I see. I was wondering if there might be a cross-browser wrapper for that though.. 

issue: how can i set attribute to@directiveelement ? for example class name to do this i have to create a view for directive? 
solution: Directives have no template. Are you sure you need a directive and not a component?. I see. Then you want a directive. I have only ever written one. It is here:. 

issue: Hey, it's angular2 room? 
solution: 

issue: When exactly do we need the angular2 polyfills ? 
solution: zone.js & reflect-metadata. 

issue: guys, why i get this error ? [<-LINK->] errorexpected directive value 'undefined' on the View of component 'App' 
solution: moved around in the code so that they're defined before they're executed.. Lauris01: you would not have this problem if you kept your components in separate files and imported/exported them.. 

issue: Does anyone know where find how to do interface injection? Tried something likeproviders: [provide(IEngine, {useClass: Engine})],, but have strange Zone-related error ('IEngine is not defined`, however IEngine defined upper). I have strong feeling that I am doing something wrong :) [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: #input means two way data-binding? 
solution: Mangytai: : No, with the #input I mean putting that directly in a template, so you can access it with@ViewChild.. In this case, I want to pass a relative input element along with an event on an input field.. The reason for this is that I only want to actually fireupdateRowif the other field in that set is not focussed after the blur.. 

issue: how do i grab URL params? without using a router 
solution: is there any way to do this without using the router libraries since i'm not using a router?. 

issue: how can i use Promise in angular2 ? where do i import them ?? 
solution: 

issue: will I be the charitable cause? :D 
solution: CaptainCodeman: lets talk about that?. 

issue: is it possible to have a service constructor run as soon as the app was bootstrapped or before or anytime without having to implicitly inject the service? 
solution: rolandjitsu: Withbootstrap(...).then(...)you can get theInjectorinthen()and aquire and instance imperatively. This is when bootstrapping is done and you don't need to inject. 

issue: backend is ready? 
solution: as i know there is some pain with token base auth for aspnet core. well there is not way to add http interceptor. but you could create some wrapper around basic http to add your Bearer token to each request. 

issue: Please.. anyone..? charity project.. ? 
solution: This is total charity project. if I were to accomplish something in my life it is absolutely this project. I tried to learn web development for a long time (Angular , NodeJS...) and I feel that it's not me .. I am trying to search some kind people along the way ..The app idea is basically giving people to share their thoughts and feelings anonymously with other people. in the native language.So if my name is Dana and I am 24 yr old, a woman lives in Israel and I would like to talk with another Israeli woman 30 years old , I will be able to do that by minimal effortI would like the first release to be in Hebrew so I can publish this tool in Israel and make it happen. I fill it can work.. 

issue: I have encountered an odd scenario after switching to jspm.Given the following code: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: and it might actually just beimport Highcharts from "highcharts". 

issue: Is there a way to specify where in the dom a component is rendered other than accessingElementRef.nativeElement 
solution: 

issue: could someone give a look? [<-LINK->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: yay! I'm guessing we will see it with b.16 
solution: ericmartinezr: : if a child wants to send a message to parent component, we use event emitters. if we want to call function defined in our child component from our parent component, how can we do that ?. 

issue: PhilippSchaffrath: I am fixing my cookbook, will be up shortly 
solution: ekarlso: a guide for angular.io. 

issue: so the question is: Do you think my cookbook achieves that? 
solution: i whish your cookbook was the first thing i would have read. takes way longer, but you gain more confidence, and by reading only your cookbook, there is the possibility that i would have been too lazy to go even deeper. 

issue: is systemjs recommended over webpack ? 
solution: they are not solving the same problem. webpack 2 can use system.js. but I understand what you mean. 

issue: Does somebody have a good example with authentication in angular 2? Thanks 
solution: 

issue: hello guys, about what cookbook you are talking about ? 
solution: 

issue: is it already in the documentation repository? i would love to read that 
solution: 

issue: when to use [routerLikn] and when to use router.navigate? 
solution: 

issue: MikeRyan52: why two steps for the code? (ts -> babel)? 
solution: And you need that mix to leverage Webpack 2's tree shaking. MikeRyan52: I use es6 modules with TS directly to ES5, no babel. 

issue: what doesn't work? 
solution: zoechi: , when I run the code and I type my name it's like this info is not passed to the PropertyBindingComponent. Also, the age does not get updated to 26, but it remains 20. 

issue: if you want to pass 26 just myAge="26" no need of square brackets but I think I am not following the issue pretty well 
solution: 

issue: Anyone know if classes that extend a base class require any special treatment from Angular? 
solution: you can do it, but its generally ugly with DI (aside from all the usual issues with inheritance). 

issue:  [<-LINK->] hows the boot time for everyone on that? 
solution: both, really. profiling shows 340ms for me for finish. 

issue: please show some code@rohitrp 
solution: I believe the problem is in the div with class status at the bottom. rohitrp: have you tryed with==instead of===?. 

issue: can you do 2 way data binding with an async object? 
solution: well i am retrieving this object for update really. so i retrieve the object from http, display it, get the changes and then send it to another service. 

issue: Hi! How can I update value in child component from parent component? I've tried using@Inputbut is seems to work only first time. 
solution: 

issue: Not to distract you guys too much, but are Http posts relative to window.location.origin?Edit: words 
solution: Jefftopia: : they should be relative to<base>I would guess?. alxhub: but base is relative, right. Anyways, I guess that answers my question. Relative to base, base relative to origin, so I guess it's relative to origin. We'll see.. 

issue: Isn't pure WebSocket enough? 
solution: ericmdantas: It was enough in my previous (pure js) experiments. I just saw the HTTP example and thought maybe it would be preferable to use such a component, if it existed.. BossFeratu: I remember there was a discussion long long time ago about it. 

issue: what packages do I need to install to work with firebase? 
solution: 

issue: in angular2 how to include partial to html? 
solution: shashank-virtueinfo: use@componentwith template url. but for partial also have to use@component?. I mean for header and footer file. 

issue: is it public? can we point to you when people ask for examples? 
solution: It’s a community site for stylists and designers.. escardin: we’ll be dropping the beta soon, but that url will stay alive.. 

issue: why is zip preferable? genuinely not following 
solution: 

issue: Is there an way to build a form using an observable from an http call? 
solution: xFailsafeNY: can you elaborate? are you the one that's trying to use two way binding with async?. xFailsafeNY: I did something like that with my dynamic forms module. I basically constructed the controls for the form once the template and the data arrived, then stuffed it into my form component.. 

issue: In Visual Studio Code I'm getting a '[TS] Unreachable code detected' inside my switch statement on the break; The code compiles, is this just a VSC warning? 
solution: 

issue: Will the footprint of the final release be any smaller? My vendor.js is like 5MB! 
solution: Well, yes and no. He is a dev himself so he understands the value of refactoring. But I am implementing RxJS  at the moment and that took some convincing.. 

issue: Can I stop angular2 from removing stuff under the root component 
solution: webtrix: as the root component is bootstrapped it removes any existing child elements of its selector. 

issue: any clues why this works fine as an angular2 template [<-CODE->] but this isn't ok [<-CODE->] srsly, whats wrong with <p>?? 
solution: you are correct@alexanderchr, only phrasing content is allowed in a <p> tag ( [<-LINK->] ).  so I guess fair enough.. 

issue: dnear: Directives don't have a host. How do you mean? 
solution: Yes, makes no difference. I have 2 usages for the page =>newandedit. Edit works fine, new does not. The only difference between those is the budgetSource.. If I mock the outgoing connection like thisObservable.from([new Budget()], null),onCompletedis never called.. 

issue: What's your issue with using real time sockets? (not strictly sure what that is) I assume you mean websockets? 
solution: And websockets work mostly as expected.. 

issue: Might anyone be able to tell my why the ngOnChange function does not append to the “Change Log” when the toggle button is pressed? [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Hi, is it possible to inherit from a component or a directive ? 
solution: fknop: technically yes, but the behaviour is undefined and should not be counted on.. 

issue: Can we have theinputarray AND@Inputin the same component ? 
solution: I know, so what's the best way to have input properties in common ? I don't want to inherit a component from a component. Just a simple class, and even angular 2 does that.. 

issue: Hi all, I've been reading up on best practices and a few times I've seen it mentioned that Subjects shouldn't be used... I'm curious as to why. 
solution: ericmartinezr: I can merge that, I think I had some comments to address first.. 

issue: Can anyone please look into this issue - [<-LINK->] would really appreciate 
solution: I am trying to reproduce it on plunker. But I don't think any issue would come there. As I said, it works fine with npm based servers like lite-server or http-server. Not working when I put the code on prod with nginx. 

issue: Is it possible to create a component which extends another component? 
solution: for instance I create a layout component and then can do something like this:export class Dashboard extends LayoutComponent {}. all decorators@Component(),@ViewChildren(),@Input(),@Output(), ... need to be added to the class that is actually used as component. 

issue: and where do you validate the JWT token on the server? 
solution: 

issue: I am working on a mobile app usign angular2 and phonegap and it's ready for production. For me it looks ok to use in production. I am using beta 14 
solution: steven-fernandez: Yes. It's similar like web. But it needs to be target to newer devices where you have HTML5. For Android 4.4 + and iOS 8+. 

issue: Can you push your updated code? 
solution: 

issue: does angular2 always want to load references from the root of the app or am i configuring something wrong? does angular2 always want to load references from the root of the app or am i configuring something wrong? 
solution: imports seem to be, and if we use the gulp plugin to inline the template it seems to find them just fine, but i'm trying to build some things with angular-cli and when I serve it blows up because it can't find./alert.component.html. I've tried justalert.component.htmlbut it doesn't seem to matter, always wants to go from the root.. 

issue: Hi, how to check if  Observable<any> exist any value in it? 
solution: ericmartinezr: holy crap@choellercan part the red sea! ;). 

issue: my lack of crypto knowledge? 
solution: well.. the thing is there is so much "wrong" info. but the article seems to omit the "explanation" part haha. 

issue: is my jwt discussion still going on? o.O 
solution: but since the backend already works with JWT. 

issue: there is a equivalent at OnInit for service? 
solution: btw can someone help  me with this: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Brandon: I now only use ROUTER_PROVIDERS when I bootstrap my component, but still can't get my component to show on init? 
solution: brandonroberts: Having troubles loading it in my browser outside of electron, cross origin request problems.. 

issue: Anyone, gone ahead writing an NG2 project for production? 
solution: first production release is probalby in a month or so. some google products written in Angular2  are already in production I believe. 

issue: viktorgullmark: I got your app working with Electron. Just change your app to use the HashLocationStrategy 
solution: 

issue: I got some exception:error TS2304: Cannot find name 'require'. [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: Is the offline template compilation here? 
solution: The other thing it would probably break would be IDE template analysis, since we can't run that on jade. The mechanics are in, and it works, but it's a CLI tool right now. 

issue: so there's no good reason to use require (for templates) anymore ? 
solution: well, you probably need to require but using a new codegen loader?. The codegen loader already understands the decorator so it doesn't need require. 

issue: The trouble there is that's a reallllllly low level browser thing, like how it does task scheduling. So we need a good repro to understand where its differig 
solution: below a certain level of complexity, using most frameworks makes no sense (although it demonstrates "tree shaking" if it shrinks things down a lot). 

issue: what's the content of portifolio.ts at line 39? 
solution: this.allphotos = [];that's line 39?. this._listphotos.create().subscribe(value => this.allphotos.push(value))that is. 

issue: how to prevent default DOM action on form submission? 
solution: I had multiple windows open with browsersync, probably this caused it. 

issue: they are for angular 1@alexzaporozhets 
solution: alexzaporozhets:  [<-LINK->]. alexzaporozhets: this room is for angular 2, yes, the name is confusing, angular.js = angular 1, angular = angular 2, very clear (not). 

issue: Do I need to Inject the elementref to my service to be able to use the BrowserDomAdapter? 
solution: you can use the service notify the component that you want to change and let the component to modify itself. 

issue: te-je: , what beta are you using? 
solution: 

issue: for the RC announcement? 
solution: would think a first RC could be up end of august... 

issue: now I'm facing into this issue:this._renderer.createElement is not a function in [null] 
solution: import { Renderer } from 'angular2/core';import { BrowserDomAdapter } from 'angular2/platform/browser';. 

issue: Try receiving the content as a different class, 
solution: 

issue: DoesSomeGlobalDirectivehave to be an array with the directives or can i just put as many as necesary inside useValue? 
solution: PLATFORM_DIRECTIVESexpects an array, you can put as many as you like there, or nest them if desired.. 

issue: Do I have to injectDatePipemy self or it's already injected? 
solution: 

issue: If a component is not rendered with *ngIf, will it be detected with@ContentChildren?  Seems not to. 
solution: bjorneven: no. it's removed from the DOM.. I guess turbo goes a long way.. next lappy will be a loaded mbp :). 

issue: all row should be clickable using this code. am i wrong? 
solution: you mean the cursor doesn not change it look, but element is clickable. cursor is not changing its look as well as element is also not clickable. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: today is monday, it should wednsday, right=. 

issue: Hello everybody [<-CODE->] 
solution: SilentSpammer: currently you can’t.. SilentSpammer: you could create a “RedirectComponent” that takes the id and does that navigation, but you can’t do the redirect directly. brandonroberts: Later, I guess, in this notation would be problems with injecting... in more complex cases. May be due to this that issue are not realized yet.... 

issue: who's paying? 
solution: I didn't bet on that. I've seen that technique as well. where is this peace of code situated in your appexport * from './users.components';@MurhafSousli?. 

issue: judgement day 
solution: there were issues with last wed release, I think if it gets to Wed then it won’t happen. When skimming the logs I saw mention of it coming out today.. 

issue: new beta is out? how many regressions? 
solution: fxck: looks like most people are still fixing breaking changes.. At least the minification issue seems to be fixed. ericmartinezr: yup, time to find out what's busted and update the list :). 

issue: goddammit how do I trigger this stupid change detection 
solution: and what is happening is that set runs, but {{ index }} in template doesn’t show anything, unless I do some action(ie. focus input). 

issue: Bundling application with System JS is not officially released? 
solution: escardin: i am using system builder already for by library, ok i will try to use it for app too, i tough there is somethingone clickofficial  one. 

issue: anyone using GreenSock Animation Platform with any apps.  i have it working in mine, but it still feels off. 
solution: 

issue: so sub routes are not specified by each specific component? 
solution: 

issue: Does anyone know where the async( function is coming from in teh tests? 
solution: JesusisFreedom: from 'angular2/testing'. 

issue: which one? the minified bundles supplied? 
solution: 

issue: Question about Observables: If I have Observable A, and things are subscribed to it, is there a way to take Observable B and merge it into A so that all of As subscriptions are notified of the elements in B? 
solution: 

issue: what the hell is a non reflective bootstrap? do I want one? 
solution: So I can use a reflective injector or a code-generated injector … [stares blankly at monitor]. I never used the long form, so I can't say really. 

issue: anyone knows about change detection strategy ?? 
solution: because I am calling a method inside the component which is working fine and then passing the particular selected value to particular component and that component has service so ultimately passing  value to that service. dixitthareja: Use input and output its pretty simple for your problem.. First I am showing list of patients using PatientListComponent and if I am clicking particular patient I am calling other component i.e PatientStudies but the problem I am getting that the ANY li element I had clicked..it is showing the studies related to that patient but then if i click other patient it calls  "onselectPatient()" method again but dont call that component...i need to refresh the page everytime if i want to see other patient studies. 

issue: how the flip is this error even possible [<-CODE->] 
solution: no, I’m trying to use angular2-jwt inside by own http service. 

issue: What’s in the view template? 
solution: seems to be working.. or at least throwing errors in a plunk. it could have something to do with the fact that I’m using@ngrx/router. 

issue: Upgrading would be easier if the changelog actually detailed the changes 
solution: I love all the combinations of APPLICATION / PLATFORM and CORE / COMMON, nice touch. 

issue: Anyone noticed weird timing issues with b16? some things seem to go a bit haywire 
solution: tree on left, data panel on right, async loading of tree nodes and panel. It used to just show “the last thing you clicked on”. Now it seems to want to show every single thing in order. 

issue: When creating a ComponentFactory new ComponentFactory('selector',[ViewFactory],MyComponent); Where can I get a ViewFactory from? 
solution: You could create a directive and grab the element instead of adding a local variable. 

issue: Hey, simple question, is there a method in Angular2 to get query parameters as an object{key: value}? Or I must parselocation.search? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, does someone know a good example how to use 'ControlValueAccessor'? 
solution: Actually I have an input that wrapped into many divs, without component I\'l do ngControl="myControl", now when I do a Component I\'d like to pass control into it. 

issue: above or below it? 
solution: 

issue: google it 
solution: The new problem appeared “error TS2304: Cannot find name 'Map'.”. 

issue: webtrix: : did you try putting them on the Script section then call it from directives/components ? 
solution: 

issue: :D 
solution: 

issue: i am a bit confused how to use FormBuilder and add a validator like required when field B has value X 
solution: Mig1st4ck: You might find this useful : [<-LINK->]. i tryed it with some changes but coul'd get it to work :(. Mig1st4ck: If you have a plunker or something similar, I can give it a look if you want (althouth I can't guarantee anything - originally I got here to ask questions ;) ). 

issue: get(url: string, options?: RequestOptionsArgs) : Observable<Response>   can somebody explain this? how to use this? 
solution: 

issue: it's not shipped yet 
solution: it's also being re-written, we don't know how much behavior & usage will change yet. 

issue: hi do can you access [<-LINK->] ? 
solution: it seems to have problems in some middle dns server. I live right next to you, and I have no problems, although my ISP sucks. 

issue: here’s a question will that mean temporary refs like [<-CODE->] will not work anymore? 
solution: Not really too big of a deal, I really don’t like adding all that extra logic into the tamplate anyway. 

issue: the # thing landed with b17? damn 
solution: ericmdantas: see the commit message for the full breaking change [<-LINK->]. next week it is going to become*forEach=“(x => whatever)”. 

issue: Are there performance gains to be had by breaking up a medium size component template into many smaller components w/ inputs for their relevant pieces of data? I understand the organizational benefits of having small, laser-focused components, I'm just on the fence about how granular I should be getting. 
solution: rosslavery: : split up components the way you would split up classes. The "Single Responsibility Principle" should play a big part in your decision. Components, like classes, should do one thing and do it well.. 

issue: code? 
solution: 

issue: anyone found that switching to typescript is really "doesn\'t necessarily require anything more than installing the TypeScript compiler and switching renaming files from.js to.ts" 
solution: 

issue: is it possible to pool multiple observables from http requests ? 
solution: escardin: i have to pull 3 equal items from 3 different urls, and i want to get an array of these three items. 

issue: command line? 
solution: ericmartinezr: for those dudes. ericmartinezr: choco install google-chrome. done. you need the shims. 

issue: yo anyone using material2? 
solution: um, no, have not used them yet. 

issue: Do you know if i can use this with systemjs? [<-LINK->] Hmm Just so many new things Bundled on top of each other I like the idea, but just a lot to take in 
solution: 

issue: how can i get the current path of router ? 
solution: i just need to pick it remove last part and call route.navigate so this can work like a go to parent route. Mig1st4ck: I guess, you cann't navigate to parent route...{ path: '/mypath/...' }is not terminal route, so you couldn't navigate there as instruction. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: what do you want to know about it? haven’t used that component. 
solution: I’m looking to add pagination this weekend.  will send you a msg if I figure it out and end up using it.  my current plan is to roll my own.. 

issue: wow, why is everyone having that issue? I can't reproduce it 
solution: I think it depends on which version you came from (rxjs). I would also ask about any other libs that use rx (angular2-jwt and ngrx/store). 

issue: how to update angular2 version i am using the angular2/seed project 
solution: Mig1st4ck: if you didn't make major modifications, you might be able to just replace the majority of the files.. 

issue: platform? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] means what 
solution: are you using the router? Not the alt, the other one. fxck:. 

issue: how is the script loading prevented? 
solution: create a single js bundle then inline it. 

issue: really? so what has changed? I'm following an udemy course by Mosh which is outdated, i guess. :( 
solution: as invar course of coursesbut in ts i guess. wow.... 

issue: what’s in your bootstrap?@atostudios 
solution: switch logincomponent for root component. 

issue: what do you mean by component? the template html? 
solution: so i just have a method updatewidthheight() and call that   after initializing and onSizeChanged. 

issue: Anyone worked with the EventEmitter yet? no real docs on that :) could do with a pointer 
solution: i found the Todd Motto one@Lazar95i'll check out the second link, cheers!. 

issue: What value would a systemjs plugin provide? 
solution: alxhub: it could do the xpile and offline compile in a single shot. like a webpack plugin would. the current systemjs <-> typescript integration is being deprecated soon in favor of [<-LINK->]. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] it gives me error: [<-CODE->] 
solution: escardin: , I know ngFor syntax is different in beta17, if that's what you're asking :). 

issue: Hi, Anyone ever got problem where ViewChild was undefined ? 
solution: baklazaner: so it's possible that ... really nothing are found. which are you querying by type or id?. 

issue: hash routing or pushState? atostudios: hash routing or pushstate? 
solution: 

issue: Soangular2/platform/commonwas re- moved to@angular/common 
solution: 

issue: I hate angular 
solution: fxck: you should checkout Polymer if you want the real future. more like_router.navigate(['Dasboard', {myParam: true}]). 

issue: why isn’t he in a corner, rocking, sobbing, like the rest of us? 
solution: you most likely want to look into the onDestroy and CanDeactivate hooks. 

issue: hi, is there a way to get rid of the deprecation warning when using an index in ngFor, i.e. ``` 
solution: change#tolet. 

issue: I upgraded my project to 0.0.0-5, everything works fine. 
solution: todoubaba: but not stable and not even "public" :P. Foxandxss:  [<-LINK->] , just working on an upgrade branch, haven't found any problems. 

issue: So next beta landing right before conf? 
solution: 

issue: What are you trying to do,@garyttierney? 
solution: alxhub: : I have an array of objects, of which I want to select one using a <select> menu. Though I\'d like to have an option selected by default (but otherwise disabled) saying "Please select an option...". 

issue: alxhub: 
solution: Excellent!. ericmartinezr: re: your router "only systemjs" question. 

issue: How do I do a two way property binding on a component? 
solution: (btw, I mean if I put the input & the curlies outside the form. 

issue: guys need to know about factory providers document is confusing 
solution: 

issue: Brandon was answering to me :P 
solution: I was thinking I could do that duplication with an attribute directive, but without *ngFor I guess not. 

issue: is there a plnkr of the new router in action? 
solution: dondre: @adesugbaaI have a plunker here: [<-LINK->]. brandonroberts: i get a blank page with Loading.... 

issue: How come people can build latest master correctly, for gods sake... 
solution: 

issue: navigate manually when it loads? 
solution: vladotesanovic: I don't know about redirectTo. i used that for UrlNotFound, but i can define Component for that. 

issue: is browsersync gone? 
solution: yeah, lite-server - beter to use browser-sync directly IMO. asset URLs are relative to the doc or whatever base href is set to. so usually wrong unless handled by the build (webpack can help with that). 

issue: has anybody bundled RC1 with SystemJS? 
solution: achimha: there is also this one [<-LINK->] , i didn't try it yet,. vladotesanovic: that one seems to be related, it also maps it to the index.js of each ng2 module which then loads all the individual js files... I guess I need the common.umd.js etc. loaded by SystemJS. 

issue: why webpack > system? 
solution: More flexibility with less code, and can fit into any stack really easily.. Does more out of the box and is way quicker than jspm/system which translates to a better DX. No problem. I don't know jack about the new router yet, but scanning upwards, it looked like@brandonrobertsand@alxhub(paraphrased) say not yet, but soon.. 

issue: What's the best resources to learn angular? 
solution: although for basic stuff they will be fine, just some things might be confusing because of recent changes. it’s going to change again, I think they are pinning a lot on the offline codegen as the way forward and current bundling is always way too big. i mean, getting down to 45k was pretty rad, but if they can make it smaller, the whole offline stuff seems awesome. 

issue: did somebody say "bind angular2 to purescript?" i'm impressed / amazed / appalled 
solution: I think overcomming this bug would be  a huge step forward so we'll see. 

issue: atulhm: thank you very much for your explaination very clearIndeed, my images in my tmp files are just while the dev-time :)I was used to develop on server-side (PHP), so I  dont have good reflexes yet 
solution: I wanted to use webpack too, but I prefered too stay with systemjs and add jspm firstly to learn javascript worldI success to auto-compile my ts files with system js and not with the watcher of tsc :DMaybe I ll migrate to webpack. 

issue: what do you guys use for localstorage? 
solution: yes localstorage... tryingi to run and localStorage is looking for angular2 not@Angular. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: I don’t expect there will be any more changes to the deprecated router to be honest. 

issue: I'm more interested on how internal apps are not affected by the reported bugs that have been there for months, and months 
solution: 

issue: are there docs for the RC component router? i could only find the deprecated ones 
solution: But broken... I still cant get a default route to work. 

issue: what IDE? 
solution: 

issue: In either case, the bindings would still have to be executed on the client, regardless of how you ferry down the data, correct? 
solution: 

issue: Guys, how does presence of[routerLink]directive influence routing? 
solution: 

issue: Since user can bookmark any url,  does server have to prerender all possible pages? 
solution: With universal zone is tracking async work, so basically it waits till there are no pending tasks and then it renders. So you could run the entire app server side if you wished. It's one of the things that makes routing and lazy loading non-trivial. Yeah, I am playing with it now. I basically just JSON.stringified the payload and put in a hidden filed. It does come down to client with the initial page, so I guess it would technically work... Not sure it's an awesome solution though :-). 

issue: you sure you have it in your npm dependencies? @angular/common, that is :) 
solution: (<Control>this.form.controls['X']).updateValue(...). 

issue: Out of curiosity, what's your use case for this and why won't ctor injection work? 
solution: 

issue: is the project described in the [<-LINK->] guide available in a repo somewhere? 
solution: mirkonasato: no. so is useless as well. Foxandxss: it's basically [<-LINK->]. 

issue: I wonder if animations will be merged in that pre-i/o release 
solution: Matias said couple of weeks, it’s gonna be couple of weeks by then. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] well what does that mean? any idea? 
solution: 

issue: Hey. Odd, that in@ngrx/routerone doesn't need to pathROUTER_DIRECTIVESinto component like with angular2 router. 
solution: jeserkin: you don’t need to, because it’s being done internally [<-LINK->]. I see, so by callingprovideRouteronbootstrapI already import them globaly. Can't figure out, why task, that I added toagnular2-seedmain tasks isn't doing anything. At least I see no result. :(. 

issue: Hi guys! Is there any guide or tips or working draft or something about how to use the new router?) 
solution: 

issue: Hi Everyone, is it possible to affect the events digesting outside of angular 2? I have encountered a strange problem as described in: [<-LINK->] 
solution: tan9: if your external library is using promises, it needs to be loaded before the zone.js script so that promise gets patched and Angular can run change detection when an async event happens. 

issue: matthew_rk_twitter: a behavior subject does this 
solution: The intent of the router it to map state to the url, if you want state not encoded in the url, then it shouldn't be passed via the router. 

issue: I don't think there is an easy way to do what you want@SilentSpammer you bootstrap one component which acts on one selector,<my-app>in your case 
solution: 

issue: thanks@penmarkthat works! but why do I need to cast it when the sample does not? 
solution: 

issue: When will be new RC get released ?? 
solution: Anshdesire: They used to release on wednesdays, but that's all been off since ngconf. use ui router or ngrx/router then. 

issue: anybody know how to get async data into a child routed component, in angular2? 
solution: the problem I have is that the child component needs an object from the parent but there is no way to pass the binding to the child via routing as far as i can see. 

issue: Hi, what is the alternative to RouteParams? 
solution: Looks like I will have to do lot of refactoring. I noticed that RouteConfig has been changed to Routes and name has been removed.My existing code is as follows, [<-CODE->] and I have routing statements like, [<-CODE->] How to refactor such code?. 

issue: Could anyone tell me if the order of a component's providers array matters? 
solution: blackheart01: @ericmartinezractually.... it can matter, but really only in a case that is imo, a bug. 

issue: Rename ambient -> global 
solution: 

issue: what build are you on? 
solution: rc1. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] I'm using angular-cli to build+serve my project 
solution: 

issue: Regarding angular di, does anyone know how to append a provider to an existing injector? 
solution: I think RouterOutlet does something like that. 

issue: anyone have a sample angular app to share? \\ 
solution: tour of heroes.... 

issue: need help on sorting min and max input values 
solution: routhu: you can usengOnChangesto listen to input-binding changes and then manipulate them if you don't like the passed in stuff - or am I getting you wrong?. 

issue: Hi guys! Is it correct thatObservable.ofis not available in ng2 since RC, or am I having problems with my setup? 
solution: 

issue: there is a bootstrap loader for webpack that’s quite handy  [<-LINK->] 
solution: no, I use xhr (resumable upload of slices). I played with fetch a little but haven’t based anything on it. 

issue: so you're probably repeating over an array of objects right? can the object identify what component to render for you? 
solution: I mean, for each class, I have a matching component, so yes. 

issue: Hi , why retry is not available on http.get(...) [<-CODE->] 
solution: escardin: but browser is not retrying :(. escardin: the very first request is available in browser but no further retries after every five second. 

issue: So how do you import Ruler service into a project now?@CaptainCodeman 
solution: It was kind of pointless anyway (conceptually broken). yeah, the Ruler service was touted whenever anyone suggested anything with .nativeElement … but all it did was make the call to getBoundingClientRect on native element anyway. I guess you should use the DomAdapter if you want access from a web-worker, not sure that is exported though. 

issue: Http client how to catch errors and handle them properly?? 
solution: xban1x: yes, you have to important almost any method except subscribe, unsubscribe, next, and emit. 

issue: Does a downgraded Angular 2 component still allow multiple transclusion in an Angular 1 app? 
solution: 

issue: poke: how would that affect my component file? 
solution: 

issue: is there an official angular 2 websocket library similar to the http one? 
solution: 2beers: websockets are patched by zone, so you don't really need a library. You can open the connection inside angular2's zone and you're done. 

issue: what id difference between [(ngModel)] and (keyup)="$event.target.value" ? 
solution: larzKke: check fornull, I don't thinkundefinedis possible. 

issue: How can a parent component trigger a function in a child component? 
solution: Uriziel: i read it, there is no explannation on how to trigger a child function from the parent. 7KVZw8C: Yes, there is an example in that link. 

issue: anybody know why I can't pass a class to a component? not an instance 
solution: I want to have a child component create an instance of a class, and have that class be unknown to the child component "at-compile-time". 

issue: is there a way to get the current injector?elementRef.parentInjector? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] This causes some modules to break and app doesn't work properly. 
solution: achimha: and it is going to be called new new router!. achimha: so then it's not related to XHR errors I getzone.js:952 GET http://mydomain/symbol-observable 404 (Not Found). 

issue: wait, I thought CanActivate was gone in RC 
solution: The new router doesn't work at all anyways.... 

issue: Is there a way to get an array of all the clicked boxes on the page? 
solution: Renniesb: yes so you\'ll want to store a "safe" copy of your array - unmodified. And then a "display" copy, that you will re-create whenever the user changes the filter options - pushing all valid values onto the new array.. 

issue: What do you guys do when you have a hard time writing code. I can't seem to visualize this or something 
solution: When I click on a box I can filter what is displayed on the page. Each item displayed on a page has an array associated with it. if one of the items in the array matches an item that is clicked it will display if not it will be hidden.. Renniesb: - “click on a box” like a checkbox or do you click a textbox and then enter in some text?  Where do these arrays come from?.

solution: it covers all of this. 

issue: I am new to all of this but if you return it with something looking like this [<-LINK->] wouldn't this mean you won't need the Promise logic outside of this service of yours? 
solution: You can import it from@angular/router/src/directives/router_outletfor now.

issue: Hi , can someone help me with angular-jwt ?@escardin;) Can someone can help me with AuthHttp with Angular2-jwt ?  [<-CODE->] Here is an example: [<-CODE->] 
solution: maissani: I used to work with it, you need to perform nject it in your bootstrap, although I recommed changing to ng2-ui-auth it has more options like social auth, and angular2-jwt is mostly made to work with their auth0 service.. maissani: I never have problem with both libraries check the ng2-ui-auth readme I found everything I need there, I thought it worth mentioning that if you want social login I don't remember angular2-jwt supporting them also the author of ng2-ui-auth made as a port of satellizer from angularjs 1, anyway to better understand your problem it's better to reproduce the error in a plunker so we can help you, based on what you shared so far it should work.. 

issue: angular 1 or 2@maissani 
solution: When adding AuthHttp in my service constructor , i get this errorORIGINAL EXCEPTION: No provider for AuthHttp!. 

issue: Guys, what do you use for the building step? Grunt? Gulp? Webpack? I have a grunt seed but I'm reading too much good from webpack to ignore it. 
solution: the cli dev process seems to be below par - lots of people report it’s slow (too many requests). 

issue: What exactly are you typing,@GuillaumeUnice?

issue: what does typings.json file in visual studio 2015??? 
solution: 

issue: Unexpected token < you accidently did < somewhere 
solution: jlsuarezs: i've seen that on my webpack/angular2 project.. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Anyone seen this before? Here's my sys config too:  [<-CODE->] 
solution: achimha: funny because I didn't notice that until I posted it here. 

issue: newusersis an observable? 
solution: Also AngularFire supports alimitTooperator I believe.. Yeah.limitToFirstandlimitToLast.. 

issue: Hi allCan someone please help me about how to display a loading spinner each time the user navigates in my app? 
solution: 

issue: anyone working with the CLI? 
solution: just buy a droplet in digital ocean (my referral link: www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=31936a746770) and link your droplet to koding.com for example. 

issue: is() => {}the shortest "blank"? 
solution: achimha: finally is a transforming operator, it's expecting you to give it a new observable to work with. 

issue: Its gonna be “The router@CaptainCodemanhates” no matter what 
solution: I say express your criticism with PRs :-). 

issue: is the only way to get the angular service worker to use angular/mobile-toolkit? and if so how far are sw push notifications away from being implemented? 
solution: man... disabling the minify in angular-broccoli-bundle.js and disabling the uglify in angular2-app.js did nothing.. build still takes forever and output is still minified/uglified... what the hell am i doing wrong. 

issue: How can I call a pipe from code instead of in the template? 
solution: You'd have to new it, but yeah. 

issue: ? 
solution: 

issue: Anyone familiar with the angular load process? 
solution: 

issue: Good morning 
solution: I want to open child component on on click and other click, it would be hide. Weather is very rainy, might see some  later today!!. 

issue: what's the pros of using ngrx/router vs the standard router then ? 
solution: the proplem is when the url contain a space, the request do not complet, also the target website does not parse escaped url. 

issue: how to see what i am getting at http response? How to see what i am getting in http response ? 
solution: 

issue: you just came out? 
solution: 

issue: Does anyone have a simple example lying around of using an observable to monitor an uploads progress? 
solution: 

issue: any rumours about next beta? or rc 
solution: So that’s what I thought concerning the import, but I’ve got a [<-CODE->] when I import it like that: [<-CODE->]. 

issue: how do i print json value using ngMOdel? 
solution: roxcity: If you need to manage a value and display another, you probably need to use an attribute directive of your own, although I can't be of much help on this matter. Although it is a different problem, you might find the last Plnkr of this SO response useful : [<-LINK->]. 

issue: anyone knows My project cannot compile 
solution: you just need to tell the templateUrl the full path to it, you can’t just refer to ‘./template.html’ for it to be relative. 

issue: is all the animation stuff from the ng-conf videos still in the pipeline or can we use it in rc1?  ng2 docs are sparse on the subject 
solution: mhov: looking at the commits it should arrive in RC2. 

issue: Top of the morning to everyone. 
solution: 

issue: so with all of that, most likely what's happening is you're emitting before anyone has subscribed. 
solution: 

issue: So anyone got an example of a loading indicator for ng2? 
solution: So I would imagine it needs a UI component for the display which takes a service that listens to the HttpRequests and Observes them for changes etc... don't stick it to HttpService... keep it independent... this component should be re-useable and its job generally is to show a loading image when you are waiting on data to come so it can be used anywhere .... (if I got your point). 

issue: any tutorial for jwt? 
solution: yah but i need to use them for both server and client , don't i?. auth0 is the client part, so I need to use jwt library for server too. am i right?. 

issue: What's the official and blessed way to inject a safe reference todocument? 
solution: There is actually a Title service for that, but yeah.. I saw that one.. 

issue: Anyone know the rxjs equivalent ofPromise.resolve(value)? 
solution: escardin: I have a function that returns anObservable.fromPromise, but I need to conditionally return a static value sometimes.. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Its ok to apply the async pipe twice right? 
solution: I saw toPromise not fromPromise. brandoncollins: it's two subscriptions, with all the caveats therein.. 

issue: Does anyone know what causes the error Cannot read property 'visitStatement' of undefined..... I know that means something is undefined but what? 
solution: escardin: I have nothing defined with whatever.visitStatement ... I was wondering if someone knew more about the internals of angular and would know where visitStatement  is defined.. 

issue: Hi guys, i have a question. I spent more the 4 hrs seraching but nothing. Image this scenario: [<-CODE->] how can i get the values of the routes params :id and :name in the UserComponent scope? nop router 2.0.0 rc.1 
solution: i tried with routerOnActivate function but the param value only exist in their own Component example in TeamComponent, I can access to :name value but not :id this last one is only visible in AppRootComponent. 

issue: Do you know what this error means: Cannot find pipe fraction. in [null]  ? 
solution: 

issue: Question: How can I call enableProdMode() only when process.env.NODE_ENV is set to 'Release' ? I'm currently using gulp and SystemJS builder. 
solution: 

issue: i would appreciate if somebody could look at my radio button plunkr [<-LINK->] and suggest a solution or workaround 
solution: sylvainpolletvillard: I don't want to use ngModel with radio buttons, I generally prefer using ControlGroup and Control. For a single radio button group it kind of works, look at [<-LINK->]. 

issue: is it possible to upload an angular 2 project to github pages? 
solution: 

issue: what are you using as a module loader?@foxjazz 
solution: i mean like, for angular. you probably need to add it to your config there. 

issue: what router do you use? 
solution: 

issue: Anyone knows how to implement google sign in with angular2 typescript? 
solution: 

issue: so how do I get rid of the lifecycle warnings ? 
solution: I noticed it's missing an option in the metadata to set a default route... And all the docs on angular.io still reference the deprecated router.. 

issue: does material have its own layout engine or do you still need something like bootstrap? 
solution: you can only access properties of the current component in the event expression. if you have object namedauthI think it should be (click)="{{auth.login()}}". 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: <input type="file" (change)="onChange($event)" />. 

issue: Hello. Is it possible to define@Routeson the main component and use routerLink in a child component to navigate? I\'m getting this error when I try it: Component "App" has no route config. 
solution: 

issue: Is there a code analyzer or something like that that would tell me when I have unused imports, variables and such? 
solution: orangesoup: tslint. 

issue: can I emit an event down? 
solution: no. 

issue: the cli helps hide some of the complexity of it all 
solution: CaptainCodeman: yeah that's my feeling. I'm also hoping that when they start doing offline compiles it'll just handle it for free.. yeah, it should just happen. but the doc about how they did the demo for google io didn’t fill me with warm fuzzy feelings, it sounds impractical / hard to reproduce and automate. 

issue: I am having a problem with a template using one of my objects [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: XMLHttpRequest cannot load [<-LINK->] . Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin ' [<-LINK->] ' is therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 401 I can do post but not get request why? 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys, in normal javascript switches you can have multiple cases with the one body, how about the NgSwitchWhen? 
solution: 

issue: what kind of reflection are you getting? 
solution: 

issue: I find this to be the most interesting place for news [<-LINK->] when it's actually up to date 
solution: 

issue: theigitty: why did you do that in the constructor? Why not simply do<my-cmp draggable="true">? 
solution: thegitty: check out this plnkr [<-LINK->] and compare it to yours. I remember I had to implement a fewdrag*events to drag & drop to work. i saw that plunkr already but cannot see any difference (except that I use the HostListener instead of :host). 

issue: how to check for invalid jwt token ? 
solution: escardin: suppose a scenario if someone changed token purposely, then I will have to logout the user.. 

issue: Hiee everyone, right now I have data model as my json structure is coming...but if i have nested json...does angular 2 can parse it?? because for simple json structure it is parsing itself 
solution: 

issue: so any idea how to get something like this to work [<-LINK->] @alxhub@escardin@ericmartinezr? 
solution: it gets rid of the error@ericmartinezrbut it doesn't actually work. 

issue: can we subscribe to a function without calling http function? 
solution: Is this relating to Observables or Promises?. Yah@sam-s4s. roxcity: I found this video handy - it doesn't use http at all: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: is this supposed to compile? [<-CODE->] 
solution: this.captchaValidated = new EventEmitter<boolean>();. escardin: Is there a way to try out the unreleased core? or will it just go up in flames?. escardin: yes but the package claims to work with rc1... weird. 

issue: Hey was working on polyfill.. what is the vender.js , is it required? 
solution: CaptainCodeman: @foxjazzit's also where people tend to stuff their polyfills.. I think polyfills in vendor is an anti-pattern. 

issue: did you accidentally update rxjs past beta 6? 
solution: ngrx and angular still depend on 6. 

issue: what is the process of merging my app folder code into the polyfill startup? 
solution: CaptainCodeman: I think it's a bug waiting to happen more than an anti-pattern, but... same diff.. 

issue: change into <canvas ...></canvas> 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. angular only allows void and foreign elements to have closing single tags. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] but there is ng2-cookies inside node_modules. what could be the problem ? 
solution: Maybe you have to configure your module loader so it will automatically grab .js files@Lauris01. 

issue: me too :( 
solution: 

issue: where is your app be served from? 
solution: because the path is wrong. template and css paths are relative to the project root. 

issue: Do I read the docs correctly  - the release candidate router is not yet documented? 
solution: but it’s definitely RC. heh, so best to still use the deprecated one now.. 

issue: why not use 100vh ? 
solution: 

issue: Still no new release? waaaaaah 
solution: datrinh: you have to wait until thursday to complain.. escardin: What's then? The weekly meeting?. datrinh: no, historically releases are around now on wednesdays. 

issue: brandonroberts: I do all this in a VM using Ubuntu I'm cloning again the repo, a fresh clone 
solution: 

issue: use Http service 
solution: CaptainCodeman: I will, but I wanted to have kind-a $resource. resource was just a name used in ng1. 

issue: Have felt spoiled with these builds working so well lol 
solution: erasad22: if you are new to angular, dont you want to start with simplier things ?. no problem, I will make it, I have to add angular 2 stuffs only. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] is this normal? .css.css.js ? its loaded but it does not exist 
solution: 

issue: SergeySolonko: there isn't a version of $resource in ng2. It's a bit of an antipattern for an object to know how to save itself. 
solution: If you wanted to get fancy, you could write a more generic version and use providers to provide different versions, but I think that's a bit of a waste.. 

issue: having trouble finding many good resources on ng-upgrade -- is it possible to upgrade attribute directives from ng1 to use in angular2? 
solution: 

issue: Hello, any one tryed to upload file to spring controller? 
solution: so i need to post my file uploaded to <input> from angularJS2 to that url. Lauris01: Just use the Http service and post your data to your controller. Handling file uploads should be documented by spring and then you only have to make sure to send the correct data with correct headers using Http. 

issue: in front of a value in js casts to number + 
solution: well actually it just signifies a positive number (like +5) but it causes the interpreter to coerce the next value to a number as a side effect. so people use it to cast. 

issue: I'm still learning about Observables and recall there is a way for them to act as a Promise (where the other way around can't be said). So, how can I return an Observable like a Promise? nice I recalled correctly, thanks for the note 
solution: 

issue: I don't understand that why withouttypingsinstalled, I got error when transpiling usingtsc, I thoughttypingsis for Intellisense only [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: Guy I started to look at routing, curious why the path name has deprecated in it?@angular/router-deprecated' 
solution: there’re really no other viable option - no one should be starting anything new on the deprecated router and the new one isn’t complete enough to be usable and may be changing anyway. I haven’t used it but I would recommend ngrx. 

issue: Good morning ng-world!! 
solution: rodboc: I believe there is discussion for next week. If you scroll up enough there are weekly meeting notes you can view.. 

issue: is there a lifecycle hook that happens when I'm added to the dom (via *ngIf or something like that)? 
solution: if the value of the *ngIf is changing, then it was changed by something. you could use that something as a hook. Worst case you could use a setTimeout() to defer until the dom is updated.. 

issue: Do I need to copy over my files to a new seed project that will bundle my project for me? 
solution: To make a bundle that is independent of the SystemJS loader entirely, we can make SFX bundles:builder.buildStatic('myModule.js', 'outfile.js', options);. 

issue: MiguelAraCo: this is one reason why you keep component css in the same folder as the component 
solution: ryanlangton: For now inserting a link tag in ngOnInit works. That css is only loaded when needed and all the relative urls are correctly resolved. 

issue: how can I iterate over object keys withngFor? I have [<-CODE->] 
solution: either create a pipe to do it, or do it controller side. object properties have no guaranteed order in JS. so I guess best would be tomapthem to an array in the http request. 

issue: if I want a textbox to send to a function do I just do something <input (click)="func"> 
solution: but typescript is still compiling - but then given typescript compiles even when I try to import jibberish, this is not instilling me with confidence :P. 

issue: not using jquery? :P 
solution: I can use OnChanges to change a value in the component, but I don't see how to call a function with a parameter.. foxjazz: I mean for doing things like getting DOM objects and stuff :). 

issue: why are you using document.getElementById? 
solution: there is no *ngChange function.. when text is placed into the field, I need to call a function with the text value. it should be simple. but that doesn't get my function called. 

issue: guys is there a way to do post requests to other domains... and not getting a "No-Access-Control-Allow-Origin"..basically im asking on what the best practice for this on angular 
solution: ztampus: yes. I saw in the github commits that there will be automatic XSRF-token scanning and sending  (hopefully) in the next angular release. At the moment you have to implement it yourself.. 

issue: Hey@robwormalddo you have an idea of how many RC's there wil come ? 
solution: I am doing a thesis on migrating from AngularJS 1 to Angular 2, would be great to have some grasp on that topic haha. 

issue: Will web workers help with 60fps animation speed? 
solution: 

issue: Why not? 
solution: TheLarkInn: : That the think I don’t know which one is best :). simonleclerc: I have a very simple boilerplate/playground for ng2 and webpack, it may help you understand how it works, and then you can work your way up to something more complex like angular2-webpack-starter. 

issue: DoesRouteParamsnot support a querystring with multiple keys of the same name? 
solution: xealot: don’t think so. brandonroberts: that's incredibly depressing. I feel like that should have been one of the first considerations... super basic stuff. 

issue: heh, watching@robwormald\'s "Everything is a Stream" video. Is very useful :) 
solution: ie. if it's formatting on the front end that you're not happy with, you may need to use an input type other than date (because the browser will restrict the formatting to your locale). 

issue: rc2 is not out yet, is it? 
solution: 

issue: angular: : Which is best for production nowadays Webpack or Systemjs? 
solution: lots of good material on both. I would just pick one and learn that build system the best you can. 

issue: Hello I've got one question about webpack and angular2 
solution: simonleclerc: if you are using webpack why are you also using sytemjs?. No, I trie to replace system with webpack. 

issue: code? 
solution: 

issue: I am trying to deploy my app and index.html is the defualt. should there be a different one?  [<-CODE->] I would think these should have been packaged as part of the build not sure if Data is a datatype 
solution: I wish there was an angular2 repository using systemjs or web-pack that can be run with lite server seed out of the box.  Everything I have tried either has errors or you can do one or the other. There is no repository that I have found yet that allows for both.. 

issue: what are thexyz-buildsrepositories about? 
solution: 

issue: what's the issue? 
solution: 

issue: oh... but what i have to use then? 
solution: 

issue: what exactly are those services doing? 
solution: it just doesnt do anything (it is suppose to set[class.is-active]="visible"). then your toast service is somehow trying to access data that is not yet initialized by the time it gets to your ngInit. 

issue: is there any official statement about the road of the router ? 
solution: i also tried ngrx/router but i dont like the url-based routing. 

issue: The question is... will it Zone ? 
solution: If you can do it on the client you can do it on the server and send the response back. 

issue: when we need use [hidden] rather ngIf 
solution: Hidden will render the element (has cost) but it wont show on the UI. shlomiassaf: as i read ngIf use template. 

issue: what error? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. tsconfig is set to transpile to es6. 

issue: can we use [<-LINK->] alone ? 
solution: alexkibler:. Not yet, but I just haven't needed to yet. 

issue: This looks so weird [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: I really think they should put a freeze on things, it's getting very complex. introduce changes gradually... people won't keep up and it's making noise. 

issue: *crossing fingers for rc2 today 
solution: an artistic release with fireworks and stuff :). CarlosAmaral: no, docs on new animation system in rc2. 

issue: wait for new new new router and hope they get it right this time? 
solution: tuomasi: yeah, the abandoned router hasn’t received any attention for a long time now, and neither has the next-to-be abandoned one. ngrx seems to be the one most people are gravitating towards but if you’ve already invested in the original one and want to limit 3rd party dependencies you may as well just wait and see unless you have an urgent deadline. 

issue: :D 
solution: 

issue: should we expect RC2 today? 
solution: I try to use the implementation of@CaptainCodeman, overryde the activate method but I cant. Yeah, but in the new router I cant create a new implementation or use can activate. the new router is incomplete - the hooks you need simply don’t exist. 

issue: shlomiassaf: Is there a room related with angular2-modal ? 
solution: There is table, lots of data in td column, I want to sortBy it, when you click on header of tablw. 

issue: shlomiassaf: and it's only <script> when no need be rendered 
solution: vtsurka: the template is internal.. you don't see it and if the predicate is false there a simple html comment tag. but since its an instance you can return whatever, right? given a state..... 

issue: GroupObj[] ? 
solution: that means an array of arrays of GroupObj. 

issue: it must be an array observer.next([{number: 1}]) note the[]asdasd 
solution: ericmartinezr: You are not more Walter White :). 

issue: both of them? 
solution: deprecated one and the new one. I know it is.. but just odd, works with one and not the other. 

issue: is rc2 out? 
solution: you don’t have to but I think you’ll struggle using JS as most examples will be TS. 

issue: So I realize when using Angular2 and SVG, I need to use[attr.ngFor]vs*ngFor, does anyone know how to get access to index, first, last, etc using this approach? 
solution: That, combined with the{provide: Foo, useClass: ...}syntax, means you might be able to avoid a dependency on Angular itself for simple (non-component) libraries.. 

issue: what did u do exactly? 
solution: 

issue: does anyone know if the RC2 will have the new router? or the router is built separately? 
solution: datrinh: RC1 is so last week, a new router is already in the works. 2beers: router will be in a separate package,@datrinhboth router-deprecated and the router in rc.1 will be deprecated, they are working on a new one, that will be based on@ngrx/router. fxck: Wow, that's a lot of router then :) I thought the one used in angular-cli is supposed to be the new one.. 

issue: linux? 
solution: 

issue: any news about the latest router? 
solution: 2beers: latest router? which one? the new new router or the new new new router?. 

issue: why forms was deprecated? 
solution: new router seems to be bring back some bugs i fixed :(. you even posted link to github issue. And in published design docs a lot of words "deprecated". 

issue: Hey! I am planning the angular js then what should i do 
solution: webdevelopersantosh: That is extremely vague... lol. webdevelopersantosh: Angular.JS (angular 1) is the old one, and Angular 2 is the new one - though they are completely different. 

issue: So, the router is alreadyv3.0.0-alpha.3? 
solution: in the componentconstructor(private factoryService:FactoryService){};ngOnInit(){let serviceA=this.factoryService()}won\'t compile with "cannot invoke expression whose type lacks a call signature" but the typof of this.factoryService is \'function\'..... 

issue: ;D 
solution: 

issue: :D 
solution: 

issue: alvipeo: I am on 1.8.10 and the new router works.. 3.0 alpha 3 
solution: 

issue: it replaces state without history entries? 
solution: Hopefully coming on the way.. I miss the router-link-active class being set for the current route link.. :(. the strategy on the router is make the core stuff work right first, and not worry too much about sugary things. 

issue: What are the advantages of using Observables for managing your application state / data? 
solution: 

issue: Has anyone managed to getredirectTowork? 
solution: Click the Crisis Center, and get redirected to Heroes route instead. 

issue: oh and@brandonroberts:) 
solution: new router   just one concern [<-CODE->] does the canDeactivate can be any func or does it have to be a function inside the component routing to?. ndcunningham: try this one: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: to the router police? 
solution: 

issue: any one can answer my question please am going crazy? 
solution: 7KVZw8C: you need share part of your code which may cause error and also what error shows, then people can help you. 

issue: the rc1 router has been abandoned, there is a new router no, it's not just you :) 
solution: Time to implement the old one I guess =). there is more info and docs about that one. 

issue: anyone have an inline script for templates that works for bundles? 
solution: I know a certain popular bundler that does automagically inline your templates with no extra work involved. 

issue: you're passing an undefined component somewhere Using the router, this would throw that error [<-CODE->] 
solution: TheLarkInn: i actually did a similar experiment with inlining templates: [<-LINK->] not sure regexes are a very robust approach though. I mean, it's not thebestapproach but tbh, it lets you still use the require() and raw loader so you can do things like use sass and less chained on.. 

issue: Does anybody know why i get this error ?? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: What version of TypeScript is in your package.json? 
solution: joeherold: probably a discussion for another time, but if your boss is going to kill you for not getting a piece of work done with arctechnology with minimal (as far as the router is concerned) documentation, you might want to find another boss / company. That or get paid… really, really well. For your sake, I hope that last part is true.. 

issue: Does someone know how to use ViewChild when a parent has a NgIf? that doesn’t seem to work 
solution: yes, it looks like ngIf prevents it from exist at ngOnInit, which makes sense. 

issue: I won! against myself! 
solution: 

issue: <input type="email" #email [(ngModel)]="customer.email" class="form-control" required />how can i check if this contained invalid email ? I only can check if common invalid usingemail.valid:( please guide 
solution: 

issue: you can exclude folders from indexing as well this cooled down our macs 
solution: 

issue: thanks 
solution: 

issue: alpha 7 is out 
solution: 

issue: can u reproduce this in plunkr? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. it has a different exception although similar behavior. 

issue: what is wrong with form after upgrading to rc-2 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: hmm.... not too sure yet,but it seems like i can't just us whole model. as in.... i want to use abc, but only abc.name or abc.age valid. 

issue: Added a stackoverflow bounty for [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: you can just use rollup + their node resolve plugin dont need to use TS for it 
solution: 

issue: whats the syntax for definingSymbol.iteratorproperty on a class? 
solution: sbbowers__twitter: seriously, consider if youreallywant to do this. rather than just having a service which returns data to you from method calls. 

issue: rxjs-es is replacing rxjs? 
solution: (and rxjs-es will disappear soon). 

issue: try [<-CODE->] 
solution: @vladotesanovicAlso, canActivate is not triggered within all child routeswith the given config it should trigger only once for parent component. 

issue: does anyone here have experience with angular2 and [<-LINK->] ? 
solution: i mean that your question is mostly irrelevant to angular2. 

issue: guys, doestraceurpackage a dependency of anything from Angular? or its dependencies? 
solution: 

issue: post your packag.ejson file 
solution: remove the one you have and install it again as@DzmitryShylovichsaid. you mean delete the file right. 

issue: Any ideas on how to prevent a component from initializing until certain asynchronous data has (successfully ) returned? 
solution: @xban1x  I was doing that initially, like in the following [<-CODE->] however with the new Router mechanics, the <router-outlet> isn't allowed to be in a conditional state anymore. Since all component views need this 'check' I'd prefer to have it in one center point and not in every component view. 

issue: what's the equivalent of$parsersand$formattersin angular2? 
solution: 

issue: is there some replacement forCanReusein the new router? 
solution: zoechi: afaik they're reused by default, you observe the params instead.. also afaik they need to be display port when possible, the gpu only has 2 timing chips or some such for driving non displayport displays.. 

issue: how can I use a pipe in a component programatically? I am trying to use thedatepipe in code 
solution: You can directly use the class in your component.. saw that on SO but I get an error that the DatePipeProvider was not found. Not sure if I need to set that as a provided - didn't make sense to me. 

issue: :D 
solution: 

issue: Couldn't you emit an event and have the parent handle it? 
solution: shared/index barrel loads authenticate service last and navbar index first. DzmitryShylovich: load the dependency first inside the barrel then load the dependent for that after if you are using thatbarrel ('shared/index')as one of your imports. 

issue: vojtapol: we merged 100+ community PRs between rc1-2 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] any ideas? 
solution: export const routes: RouterConfig = [{ path: 'guide', component: GuideComponent }];. Alileus: , your path there is'guide'. There is no route for/.. 

issue: i'm trying to pull from json file that have no [ ] in it! where should i add them? 
solution: 

issue: Hi. What the syntax for catch-all routes in new router? 
solution: brandonroberts: Doesn't work for me. I try to catch routes for path 'admin/files/**' and getCannot match any routesfor example 'admin/files/aa/bb/cc'. brandonroberts: i get the error because this import { containsTree } from'@angular/router/url_tree’; Cannot find this. 

issue: new router forces you to do things in modules at least for me it does 
solution: i have to split everything up guard here component there service here all over. brandonroberts: when i reload the component with the hidden element it appears and after seconds dissapears. 

issue: Is there a roadmap or design document for the new router?  I have some feature requests, but I don't want to submit them if they are already in the plan. 
solution: 

issue: How do I use custom directives in a form?  For example, I've got an SSN input that'll have three inputs that will be combined into a single value and emitted up to the parent as if it were one form input 
solution: 

issue: anyone what is the replacement ofrouteParamsin the new routing module? 
solution: djeffal-obeyda: Long story short.. there is no direct replacement. or at the given time rather. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: how do u embed code in chat? :D 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Can anybody tell me what I am missing here please? 
solution: 

issue: sooo would you like me to explain here, or not 
solution: all the low-level APIs in angular that interact with the view take componentFactories. 

issue: Hey all, transitioning to new forms api and getting "No provider for ControlContainer"; anyone seen that before? 
solution: 

issue: this is how i am subscribing 
solution: this.route.params.subscribe(params => {}). briananderson1222: Yeah... apparently.. 

issue: this sucks.. I can't hvae more than 1 router config eh? 
solution: sethdorris: that definitely sounds like a normal configuration that is allowed. 

issue: is name prop in route config deprecated? 
solution: I don't know if ugly and horrible, but it will add twice the work. Specify all the routes, and specify all the components in the precompile. 

issue: I was going to say after the .map in the response chain a.do(console.log)to see what the data type is? 
solution: TheLarkInn: @babealthanks alot for your help its working.. 

issue: Does *ngfor accept the async pipe? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: So, on the v3 router lazy loading.. supposing I have the following routes: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: Wow, alright, got it working. Instead ofreturn Object.assignI put it on another line and just returnedacc. 

issue: anyone knows off the top of their head if the new forms guide is up to date with RC3? I've seen some changes in RC3 that are not an exact match with the proposal document 
solution: In particular I'm having issues with the change in ngFormModel, now removed. Also the proposal doc seems to have a different syntax for creating form groups, whereas in real life folks are using form builder it seems. 

issue: providers: [REACTIVE_FORM_DIRECTIVES], directives, not providers 
solution: Try and got that:Parser Error: The '?.' operator cannot be used in the assignment at column 19 in [model?.created_at=$event]. 

issue: have you fully npm-uninstalled it globally and locally? 
solution: I followed the instructions, remove globally,  clean cache, and then install again. *that last-ngwas meant to be-sn, skip npm, which I did only in some cases, after many tries and clean cache every time I didn't want the npm install to run every time. 

issue: what is correct way to do this ? [<-CODE->] 
solution: xmlking: I'd use a function to summarize this complexe line.... let zone of getZones(). 

issue: [(ngModel)]="(model | pipe)" doesn\'t work? 
solution: that would be the best solution for me, I did not try since I don't think it works to handle ngModelChange event.. I think that I will first try something like: [<-CODE->]. zpul: it\'s effectively the same as [(ngModel)]="(model | pipe)".  [(ngModel)] just a sugar. 

issue: Does the order in which providers are defines matter in ng2? 
solution: sfabriece: normally not. 

issue: That's sweet@markthethomas. 
solution: 

issue: is there a way to make this code run concurrently? meaning if athis._device.Device(device)fail, I would still get the other ones? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] 
solution: BenevidesLecontes: so what I am trying to do should be simple. I am trying to call a function in the parent component, but if I just pass the function, there is no parent instance to populate the display data. So now I am left with copying the parent instance to all the children so that I can populate an array for the parent which will be displayed in the app as a list.. 

issue: is there a way to add query params to a plnkr? wrong channel :) yay! thanks 
solution: 

issue: the last link doesn't have a bundle, right? no, it doesn't 
solution: ericmartinezr: I can see loader.js that has Angular stuff. ericmartinezr: "loader.js" there is angular/core + common + some platform stuff. 

issue: can you gist the service? 
solution: 

issue: how can I render data dynamically then without interpolation? 
solution: interpolation is the whole (well, mostly) point of angular. something in your enviroment is wacky. 

issue: what does .getFileName() return? 
solution: 

issue: zone.js is the core of change detection. what do u mean by 'avoid'? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: I mean, can I work with original requestAnimationFrame, or isolate XTK outside ANY zone.. Tried, it did not help. Because it "Executes the fn function synchronously in Angular\'s parent zone and returns value returned by the function.". 

issue: Does anyone know how to use RouteParams with the new router 3.0? 
solution: briananderson1222: let id = +this.router.routerState.queryParams['id'];. 

issue: +is javascript way of converting the string to no 
solution: sirajc: That bug you mentioned is not a bug, maybe a misunderstanding. I agree with you, but was confused looking at this bug, because there expectation is totally different then what you raised bug for. 

issue: Is there a way to use a directive to compose a set of directives, mainly for simplifying the markup? 
solution: briananderson1222: So I have a standard pop-up form that works through applying multiple directives:. and most of the information of the form could be specified much more eloquently with:. 

issue: anyone know why only my H1 gets rendered ?? [<-LINK->] 
solution: briananderson1222: I get the name of my file.. 

issue: I'm trying to inject a Service inside another one, with no success, any one with experience in doing so? 
solution: normally services that inject other services require@Injectable(). I have two services both with@Injectable();. 

issue: shouldn't there be two org value emitted? 
solution: 

issue: Heyy, I have a question. Is this an okay place to ask or should I stack overflow 
solution: 

issue: Hi@DzmitryShylovichcan you assist me in this [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: I have created plunkr for this [<-LINK->] but everything works fine one strange thing though in plunkr I am not using RouteComponent, FormComponent everything is using Component. 

issue: thelgevold: thanks for your offline comp/codegen article, wondered if you had a direct comparison available of the bundle sizes? I'm very keen to see what the results are beyond the trivial 'hello world' demos. 
solution: CaptainCodeman: I have to experiment more with the bundle sizes.  For me 120k seems to be the baseline, but I want to find out how much of the tree shaking we have to "give back" when the app uses more of Angular.  However, I guess it\'s not just size, but also some benefits from reducing the rendering overhead. Hope to spend some time on it this week.. CaptainCodeman: I did bring in the forms module as a test and I was surprised to see that the bundle size on disk roughly doubled from 400k to 800k. All I did was provide the new forms module and disabled the old one during bootstrap, but didn't actually use it in a component. This did not get gzipped though, so I am not sure what the total size will be if I deploy it to my server. The bundle that was 400k on disk ended up as 120k after gzip. 

issue: Question: How do I update the value of an input with a ngControl? 
solution: Tempus35: ngControl was deprecated. 

issue: anyone know why Observable is not an import for rxjs ? is that deprecated ? 
solution: and I import my rxjs-operators.ts at the root of my applicatoin. 

issue: Hi, I just upgraded to the latest Router alpha.8 and none of child-routes are working anymore, somebody else experiencing the same???? 
solution: 

issue: hi there, does anyone know how to cancel navigation with an asynchronous canActivate method ? 
solution: 

issue: Are there alternatives to ng2-router(ng2-router-deprecated)?P.S. Cause I'm starting to hate ng2... 
solution: 

issue: Hey, thought I'd ask here. How do you know what version of Angular the angular.io developer guide is using? Is it always using the latest? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: I was looking at the change you mentioned.this might be a repetitive question but I haven't used router v2 so I'm not sure how the data inside router worked.I can see that with that fix we can pass in simple things (like title) but can we pass in dataset that we declared in our parent component?. 

issue: any idea@alxhub? 
solution: 

issue: is anybody using Codelyzer? I have a component with selectorappbut tslint complains that it is not kebab-case 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: but the rule is just dumb.. for exampleMyApplicationis pascal case right? so isApplicationconsidered NOT pascal case? Most of these "cases" clearly apply only to multi-word names. I think it\'s a bug in the rule.. 

issue: is CanActivate actually a good way to do "auth" verification? 
solution: If you put it on the topmost parent, the children will be protected also. in my case.. the only route it would not be on is on the "auth" and "auth/logout" route :D. 

issue: why not? 
solution: 

issue: webtrix: why not use the canActivate guard on the auth/logout route? 
solution: Primarily yes, but you can use it to do some action before your route loads. 

issue: Hi@all, is there any way to loop ng-repeate with timeout means each iteration with a small delay like progressive loading 
solution: 

issue: for angular 2 which editor is good, one which shows suggestions 
solution: 

issue: ngrx/store 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: this will keep my state persisting through page refreshes? looks reduxy. 

issue: JahBrewski: are you using fb api? 
solution: you may want then run it inside angular2's zone by using zone.run(() ...). ericmartinezr: Hmm. Where would I do that? We're using facebook for authentication, but I believe our backend server is handling the logic for that.. 

issue: why does angular2 hate me : 
solution: Chameleon87: , because I coded it specifically to dislike you..  [<-LINK->] 404 (Not Found). 

issue: why would I get cannot match any routes? 
solution: I figured, but what is that now suppose to look like.. /help': path cannot start with a slash. 

issue: documenting Angular2 is a moving target... 
solution: adesugbaa: On the boat since alpha... Only way to survive this amount of change is to appreciate it to have fun while realizing how much it changed until our apps finally bootstrap again. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] ?? 
solution: ericmartinezr: That page tells you about it's existence, not about how to implement it.. My main issue is that the X-XSRF-TOKEN header being sent up does not match what the cookie sent originally, but that could be caused by any number of things.. 

issue: it can have any access modifier You should think of the template as a separate class.? 
solution: Because the compiler generates a separate class that knows how to render the template (ngfactory), and it needs to reach into the context class (the component class you write) to get those fields.. 

issue: in other words, how to listen for route changes with router 3.0? 
solution: Luchillo: the@Injectabledecorator does nothing in itself. But having a decorator in the class is what is needed to have metadata attached to it. ericmartinezr: yes, but it reports errors and not strings as with router-deprecated. 

issue: Any clue why the following code results in "this.baseURL"  being "undefined?"  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: in here we can't pase the picture  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] 
solution: Experimental support for decorators is a feature that is subject to change in a future release. Set the 'experimentalDecorators' option to remove this warning.. Iamguy84: you need to add experimental decorators to your tsconfig. 

issue: I have a service that fetches data form an API. This data is language dependant, and thebase URLchanges according to the language. How can I make the app work dependant on the language switch? I've implemented a component to switch languages and themaincomponent is aware of these changes. But how do I store the active language value (and where) in order for the service to always fetch it? 
solution: 

issue: Has anyone used Rxjs in bundled form? 
solution: webtrix: I mean the umd bundle instead of individual files. Turns out it's planned to be fixed in RC5. [<-ISSUE->]. 

issue: how to initcialize empty  Set<Object> in typescript ? 
solution: as you urself told me create a plunk.... 

issue: hi guys. Anyone know how to retrieve a response header (on http get  subscribe)? 
solution: Luchillo: , you're going to need something likelogger.setHttp(http). dragosionita: ,http.getgives you anObservable<Response>, so you can read headers off theResponseobject.. 

issue: Hey@alxhubare you able to restart the cli builds? 
solution: delasteve: , maybe fix the merge conflicts first, otherwise I don't think the CI can succeed.. I thought I rebased, sigh, woops. I restarted [<-LINK->] though, just in case that helps you.. 

issue: Anyone using angular-cli, and know how to use a node express server rather than the one built in (which I believe is what ember-cli uses)? 
solution: vinhdoan1: 'app/heroes' is the url for getting the data.  The data is retrieved using angular's http stuff.  XHRBackend is part of angular's http stuff.  In the sample, XHRBackend is replaced with 'InMemoryBackendService' (using{ provide: XHRBackend, useClass: InMemoryBackendService }.  InMemoryBackendService makes a call tocreateDbfromSEED_DATA.  ButSEED_DATAis replaced with InMemoryDataService with{ provide: SEED_DATA, useClass: InMemoryDataService }.  That is how it is stringed together, as far as I can tell.  I'm still not clear on where XHRBackend is invoked.  It must be under the hood when an Angular makes any http request.. 

issue: whatcha need? 
solution: 

issue: Where can I suggest changes to [<-LINK->] ? 
solution: jantimon:  [<-LINK->] docs repo. The proposed usage of my plugin could be improved and it would save me time to answer the same question over and over again :D. the template is compiled by webpack so if you useindex.htmlit works fine however if you add a webpackhtml-loaderit will parse and minify the template.. 

issue: EXCEPTION: Error: Uncaught (in promise): Error: Cannot match any routes: '' How can I fix that?  [<-CODE->] 
solution: Chameleon87: add a route for your home/default route to the same component but the path is "". Chameleon87: also if you want say an catch all "otherwise" route "**" as your last route will give you that. 

issue: diegolameira: whats the problem? 
solution: if I was written my app into pure js... i will just import fetch js polyfill and fetch('file.json').then(..... 

issue: Hello, do rc4 still has old forms ? 
solution: also in config.js i maped ng2-cookies like this [<-CODE->]. 

issue: hi, can some can give me a hint, how to create "scroll to button" ? tnx 
solution: 

issue: DidControlValueAccessorstop working since rc2? Since upgrading I always get the errorno value accessor for '' 
solution: 

issue: not me :( this new router drives me crazy 
solution: Such a simple thing but I didnt find a way to do it with@angular/router. 

issue: How do i get the value out of an obserable in the component ? 
solution: Anshdesire: /@escardinyeah, to display it on the page yes. but how do i get the value out form the observalbe inside the component file. for example [<-CODE->]. 

issue: Any suggestions for how to validate phone numbers? 
solution: Yoanribeiro: with ControlArray i couldn't generate dynamic fields and bind them, i didn't find a good example to do it. i need an example of dynamic control Array or form builder Array  that contain control Group. 

issue: what is the reason of using RxJS? Does it adds some usefull feature ? 
solution: you don't have to buy into RxJS completely to do that of course, but it's a well documented well supported api, etc... 

issue: I have a newbie question, what would be the best way to perform a delete all/multiple urls with http? 
solution: vinhdoan1: if you mean the REST way to do that, it would probably be using method 'delete' to /path?ids=1,2,3,4,5 etc.. ?. 

issue: anuteja: the following works fine for me: [<-LINK->] 
solution: Can you post the smallest failing example, then?  And you might check that my example works for you, as a sanity check.. nbogie: huh, got it working when I updatemyClassusing click function, in my use case, I have a rangeSlider which is a directive which emits an event to paren using@outputand my parent listens to the event and calls myredrawColumns. 

issue: So how do you use ViewChildren/ContentChildren to query elements emitted by an ngFor? 
solution: ericmartinezr: So subscribing to ViewChildren kinda works, but not for what I'm doing. It produces theEXCEPTION: Expression has changed after it was checked. Previous value: 'true'. Current value: 'false'Error. I suspect its because the act of focusing an input triggers a change detection, and callbacks subscribed to a change can't produce a change. I've no idea on how to get around this and focus an input on a change.. 

issue: I like what@alxhubsaid. 
solution: So thelazystructure mirrors the eager structure, but with modules instead of values.. 

issue: Hello Angularities 
solution: eele_____twitter: lets not make that word happen. When the object is out of service when can I render the div??. 

issue: if you have a child route. Is there an easy way to obtain the parents params? 
solution: brandonroberts: trying this in the resolve. It is complaining by saying params is null. 

issue: is an array of objects random? 
solution: an array has a order by definition.. robwormald: In an ngUpgrade scenario. How would I go about downgrading an NG2 component if the component is offline compiled to its NGFactory counterpart?upgradeAdapter.downgradeNg2Componentdoesn't accept the NGFactory instances. 

issue: One silly question:I am using this code, right now, to remove element from DOM [<-CODE->] anyone know better solution? Is there any Class that can do this for me? 
solution: bryanforbes: If you open developer tools, Elements tab here [<-LINK->] , you will see that i move sidebar outside angular app element. I do this because it is requirement of Semantic UI library ( pusher, pushable order ). If you use this sidebar element inside your app component, beside main <router-outlet>, you will never have problems, but if you inject it somewhere else it can generate lot of duplicate DOM elements. One solution is to remove it OnDestroy, other is to check if it exists ( which lead to other problems... ). 

issue: any nice angular rc 3 unit testing guides - please ? 
solution: vladotesanovic: i was looking for some examples. bryanforbes: i was looking for something similar to angular 1 unit testing examples ( like in the official doc). 

issue: is there some approach to bring some conventions to angular2? e.g. as a webpack process? I am a little bit tired of wiring everything together all the time ;) 
solution: snellcode: I am also looking for the small improvements and conventions, e.g. derive the selector from the class name, automatically include the template with webpack if it exists...I also dont understand why my component  must know which directives are used within the template (but I guess this a complex question). 

issue: hello@rsmith731 
solution: 

issue: trying to update form values  [<-CODE->] getitng this ? 
solution: <Control>this.contactForm.controls["name"]).updateValue(value);. 

issue: Anyway I can benchmark angular 2? I seem to face a slowdown when working with a rather big data set. 
solution: 

issue: Can someone help me to implement a very very simple AJAX call in ng-2? I've put up a form which connects to my JSP file that runs on tomcat apache, get data from there and show it in a div inside my angular2 component's html file. Simple, no frills. But not wokring. 
solution: 

issue: Sorry I was not trying to be offensive. 
solution: you are looking for [<-LINK->]. so instead of running a for loop to make the calls you want to generate an array of calls then run them thru fork join and process the final result. so the 'callPriceData' returns the observable instead of processing a subscribe...then after you have accumulated all your callPriceData calls you plug them into a forkJoin and subscribe. 

issue: Does anybody know why I can\'t navigate to an anchor (id="teams") if the link is placed in one partial and the #teams div in another? 
solution: 

issue: do you need"@angular/router-deprecated":  "2.0.0-rc.2"? 
solution: yes. And if it's for upgrading and I'm not using angular 1.x I wouldnt need it correct?. 

issue:  [<-ISSUE->] but why... 
solution: 

issue: Man, this module thing is making look everything harder... 
solution: It\'s slightly amusing that we\'ve come back around to the idea of an angular "module", Patrick called it "angular1 the good parts". 

issue: is it possible to wait until subscribe methode finish then call a function that use the subscribe value on observables ? 
solution: SamClockwork: i want to call it in a synchrone , block the call and wait for the subscribe methode result, then continue. if you want to wait until the call is completed and trigger some functions or anything else, the described way is just fine.. 

issue: Hi, I'm having an issue with the new forms api. Whats the correct way to pre-populate a form with values? e.g have a radio button checked when creating a fromGroup 
solution: donskifarrell: it's a tricky part of the forms. Checking is made by 2 possible way, either checked attribute or cheking it by clicking on it and triggering the css pseudo class :checked . i have had such a hard time dealing with them and a changing prefilled form that i abandoned the checkbox and went for select. 

issue: hey guys, regarding the new form API, is FormBuilder still something one should be using or not? 
solution: purban: there is something written about custom inputs possible you can that way write your own validation in that input [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Because Promise.resolve() will implicitly kick Zone.js into action? 
solution: right (sort of). Putting that template outside of this component it works fine, but inside of my component if formControlName is present on the input I get aNo provider for ControlContainererror.. 

issue: would that even work@brandonroberts?router.eventssubscribing toNavigationEndand doing the animation there 
solution: brandonroberts: could i let the parent handle it then? i think that would make more sense and less repeating code insideeachchild. 

issue: how to post code as chat message? 
solution: escardin: - Man any way to create parent observer of 2 observers ?. Cool and thanks@SharkeyO- m low in observers :(. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] @alxhubor anyone, any idea what is causing this selectbox to be cleared when you click on "trigger list change"? pretty please value is still there, its using trackby, selected attribute is correctly applied 
solution: 

issue: Is there a way to pass data while navigating to a child route so I don't need to go back to the server and re-fetch the information? 
solution: lukealization_twitter: Information like a single thing or more than that. I ask because you can do things like /router/:id and when you use this.router.navigate(['/route',id]).  You can then do something like: [<-CODE->]. 

issue: Is ngrx store the standard way to write services with streams? 
solution: 

issue: Does anyone know how to add an "Accept" to the http get header? 
solution: emilaasa: You would think...  I've tried      headers.append('Accept', 'application/json');. 

issue: Dependant dropdowns where the Dependant one needs to load its options from the server? 
solution: because you won't allow the attacker to make requests of your api from an unknown site.. 

issue: so how do I get the elementRef for my component? I triedthis.nativeElement.focus() 
solution: 

issue: isViewChildstill the preferred way to call a child method? 
solution: 

issue: Hello guys, quick question, what's the  easiest way of adding a CSS class to a div, based on - FormControl.valid in ng2 rc4? 
solution: 

issue: may I know how to get a hero from heros where id=1? 
solution: 

issue: Dont use a function in the template 
solution: so need to use this :(. 

issue: How can I add IF condition to templates? Bellow is an example with django [<-CODE->] 
solution: btw it's a best practice to put all your logic inside a component and keep template as simple as possible. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: j3ddesign: and user camel case for interface/class declarations. 

issue: Hello, someone have integrated angular2 within a django-rest project ?? I need help with this 
solution: Alcruz: - no worries with django ... both are independent. i have did this kind of thing using system.js. 

issue: when I finished to understand router v2, it came out v3 )) 
solution: Kaffiend: take a better look at how you defined routes, the problem may be thereI also encountered this problem. You can use a global wildcard path to redirect to main site every wrong request{path:’**’, redirectTo: ‘’, pathMatch: ‘full’}. 

issue: silly question, why my code is not working? [<-CODE->] this does not work, however, this works. [<-CODE->] 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: I changed the url from 'group/2' to '/', and now only got one output from console log. It looks like if I routed to AppComponent with 'group/2', it will be used twice.. 

issue: any good tut. of karma ? 
solution: well -there's a working example on angularclass' project if you fancy having a look at that.  [<-LINK->]. that's what i used for reference to get my dev environment up and running initially :). 

issue: when is rc 5 expected to roll out ? 
solution: so i shouldnt worry about trying to plan for the new module stuff then ?. 

issue: hi guys can i run angular 2 app on port 80 thanks 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: ericmartinezr: If you don't mind, do you have good doc for beta.2. EgyTechnology: all the official docs are updated to the latest router. 

issue: yes it is ready :) u can use it 
solution: 

issue: Could anybody recommend adata-table library? (like ng-table) I have to display log entries. So I need lazy loading (not paging) and it would be nice when the library works with rxjs-streams ;-) 
solution: fs123: I think you could build your own within reason. It's fairly easy to make your own reactive table, and then you just need to use events to trigger additional loading.. 

issue: isn't using electron kinda like having a progressive web app? 
solution: looks like desktop PWAs might not be a thing yet either.. 

issue: what's the point of all these factories? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] What provider i need for QueryList ? 
solution: you can have asubmittedvariable which will be set to true after user first click submit button. And all error class only show ifsubmitted === true.

solution: But that kind of looks like a backwards event.. rbnzdave: I don't use plunkr all that much either and I can't really tell what's going wrong either. Maybe try the Angular TS template - looks like it's working. But yeah based on what you've got already, you'll want to make sure that input is defined.

issue: got a handy guide to them somewhere@xban1x?

solution: DzmitryShylovich: So is it correct to assume that angular2-template-loader will take external templates and inline them in the transpiled components?. I added it as a loader to my configloaders: ['ts', 'angular2-template-loader'], but it doesn't seem to do anything.

solution: rc3. 

issue: Hi, how can I track changes on@Input? 
solution: 

issue: how do you guys debug observables? [<-CODE->] 
solution: Know that all controls are set.. in fact, thats not exactly my problem. The problem i have is that i receive a value via@Input(). At start the value seems to be undefined, but then it is defined... Is there a way to subscribe to that?.

issue: hi - please don’t shoot me for probably asking the obvious, but anyone has an immediate idea why I’m getting EXCEPTION: TypeError: this.http.get(...).toPromise is not a function? 
solution: just so confused as to how to know what to import where really - I think I love angular2, but angular1 had a steep learning curve; this is even more difficult to me LOL - thanks for the feedback though - I’ve got a lot of reading up to do!. 

issue: How do you disable based on form error? The following didn't work. [<-CODE->] 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: That's what's odd...form.hasError()evaluates to false even though the individual controlsdoerror.. 

issue: does anyone know what replaced the 'provide' method? 
solution: there's a message that says it's deprecated. the object literal format is the new format: [<-LINK->].

solution: 

issue: Is it possible change the location strategy of the current router with an hash strategy ? 
solution: i would like to only use hash Stratgey. vouill: {provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy}. 

issue: I don't think it's going to be deprecated. The decorator way is preferred according to the style guide though 
solution: zoechi:  [<-LINK->] btw looks like there're some issues with decorators. @zoechi @DzmitryShylovich thxi think ill stick to the decorator approach and avoid metadatabut it is interesting, for example material2 loves the metadata approach but most other ui libs i checked avoids it. 

issue: emm how is this possible custom input without value accessor 
solution: scarmarco: , you can wrap it if you really need it to work today, or send the Ionic team a PR to add it :). 

issue: What's the recommended way of styling elements with custom attribute directives? I can't seem to use the directive selector since it gets transformed in the markup: [<-CODE->] markup: [<-CODE->] compiled to [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: I have an issue with router. So, I have app.component which is my root. And this app component loads nav.component with a selector <nav-component></nav-component>. Now, the route has a component called lang.component which is being loaded via in app.controller via <router-outlet>. The problem I am having is, my route is constructed like this: ':lng/login', and I would like to access the :lng parameter for the route in either the app.component or nav.component but the only place where I can access it is the lang.component. When I try to access ActivatedRoute in app.component all values are empty or null.  Any help would be really appreciated. I went back and forth through SO and forums but all the 'fixes' for it seemed to be for alpha version and some of the features are no longer accessible in newest version.. 

issue: Any chance you can set up a Plunker? 
solution: 

issue: is there anyplace that i can get a preview of what AppModules are/will look like?

issue: Is there a way to get dynamic selectors to work?  [<-LINK->] I tried that after reading this: [<-LINK->] 
solution: tsm91: that totally makes sense, thanks so much! The issue is that we're trying to bind the data-toggle attribute of a bootstrap button to some of our component class variables and we're getting the non-native error, but I don't know how to specify an input type for the button data-toggle attribute. 

issue: any idea@DzmitryShylovich? 
solution: if it wasn't a child route component i would use@Outputand still keep store centralized in the parent. 

issue: what is "provide inside a class"? 
solution: You get this error whengetCookieis accessed on a variable with valuenull:p. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: Haha I suppose I could do it that way.  I didn't know if there was something like a FormGroup.reset() that I was missing. FormGroup.reset()it's already in the master but not released yet. Ahhh, I see.  I suppose I'll just wait till that releases then.  I was just starting to tick off stuff from a list of bugs I've accumulated. 

issue: anyone have upgraded from ngrx/store 1.5 to 2.x ? 
solution: mostly related to middlewarengrx/store@19d9fe3. 

issue: Is there any good reason you can't usengIfandngForon the same element? I expect developers would expect that to work. 
solution: lukealization_twitter: indeed - and it does work :). I'd recommend you wrap your element with ngFor inside an element with ngIf. 

issue: hmmm@TheLarkInnare you around? Webpack question :P 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] is this valid? 
solution: RigaNik: looks okay, but really, do that stuff in your JS, and don't filter arrays in pipes.. RigaNik: this is actually very old code.. still beta.. we're living in RC world now. webtrix: haven\'t tried it. Still newbie and trying to figure how to filter my array using one "search" input. 

issue: webtrix: try [<-CODE->] 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: that works! thx!. DzmitryShylovich: I really hope in the future they\'ll be a more "user-friendly" way to retrieve params ... Meligy: ComponentResolver and ViewContainerRef. 

issue: hey are constants declared inside an "it" constructor (testing) just in the scope of that function or are they through the whole describe ? 
solution: havent had an issue since learning webpack and using requireon the tempalte properties. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] that is why it's quite huge 
solution: tarlepp: I fixed a few bugs in the date pipe, I feel this pain :(. it would be nice to include momont js in angular, but they've already had big problems with bundle size. 

issue: Anyone have a bit of advise on what to do here. The value is coming back as [Object object] but obviously I would like it to be a User... [<-CODE->] 
solution: That is a bit of a simplified example... in truth there are actually 8 different input components each with their own forms and submits which all update a VERY large and complicated user record..

solution: 

issue: what does aboutRoutes look like in about.routes? oh sorry - i'm blind, i see it 
solution: i didn't spot that. 

issue: two way binding on ChildComponent@Inputwith banana sounds crazy 
solution: since it can pipe values back to the parent on the input. ndcunningham: it cuts out@outputin some way :). 

issue: can I get the previous route in ngOnInit?@angular/router 3.0.0-beta.2 
solution: I have a component that can get routed to from several areas. I want the accept/cancel buttons to return to the previous page. BahKoo: as a workaround u can access previous route in guard and save it as a query param. 

issue: just follow style guide? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: Is John Papa's released yet... I haven't checked on it in quite some time. Then you can go further into Components like Navbar > NavBarTray > etc. DzmitryShylovich: - that's what's caused my bout of organisation - i saw that earlier today :). 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: foxjazz: yourrouterLinkneeds to match yourpathfor/Contact. foxjazz: there’s a problem in your template. one sec. foxjazz: two things. Make sure yourpath: ‘Contact’matches your[routerLink]=[‘/Contact’]. 

issue: hey everyone, im curious what peoples opinions are on angular 2 and whether its worth using over 1.5 
solution: antlhuede: I've done a bunch in Angular 1... Angular 2 is much nicer :). 

issue: Those same people in future will change opinions , the thing is you have to learn / invest in future 
solution: angular material for ng1 has been abandoned.. I cannot promote the udemy course I did enough, the guys a legend.. 

issue: With the new router, what's the best place to have a check if a user is logged in when the app is initialized? 
solution: npx: - I use  a session service that basically allows for cognito userpool/ anonymous access and facebook / google identity providers. When the app is loaded it needs to check the current status and determine if a user is currently logged in or not. I am using guards for that, but I am wondering if there is some kind of global mechanism where there is a default piece of code that is executed. Otherwise if I forget a route and the user opens up that route directly (like xx.cm/terms) the startup code would not be called. Hope this makes more sense..

issue:  [<-LINK->] how do i run this?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: worked with localhost :). 

issue: Hey, is there anyway to create an empty FormGroup object? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: @pmulacJust for closure. I had the value of the [formControl]  attribute wrong. That is what the 'cannot find control '' ' error was about. It seems to be working now. Thanks for your help on the FormGroup. 

issue: what about to read about nodejs and how it works?@dhruv2204 
solution: 

issue: hey! where i can read patch notes between beta-alpha package versions? 
solution: 

issue: You could make selectedObj a BehaviorSubject and set the value with .next() so it's observable 
solution: adrianhara: it does feel like overkill at first but if you start using observable streams as your go-to solution it solves a lot of issues. Even better use ngrx/store for your models.. 

issue: you mean on an input? 
solution: yeah. [(ngModel)] for 2 way binding. when you have an ngModel on an input - to set the text, simply set the value of the model. 

issue: you can't inject interfaces they dont exist at runtime 
solution: 

issue: any ideas how to call parent component and receive an async response from it? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: that's a good question - I want to call parent to do a request and update child after that request is done. If I update the data passed to the component - component will refresh and I will need to scroll + showing error if the request failed would be a lot easier, but I guess thats a bad design. 

issue: Hmm, is there a way to execute a function after execution of a pipe in Angular 2? 
solution: lukealization_twitter: another pipe? :). DzmitryShylovich: Possibly! I think that might be the best option. That... could actually work too. I will try that one first. Thanks!. 

issue: it's a misuse of base href how it's needed for routing (if it still is) Look at the ui-router wiki - there's things there on how to setup server-side html5 for whatever platform you are on 
solution: I started by converting some of the components to Polymer and using them in the ng2 solution. That worked but I decided to carry on migrating over fully rather than have the mixed deployment. It would be a viable migration strategy though. 

issue: Has anyone succeed at using nested router-outlets? or is it even possible? 
solution: jmurphzyo: I haven't tried that, but if I recall correctly I've seem some articles that that's not possible (unless it's a new feature).. brandonroberts: , is it possible to load the routeconfig dynamically? I want to build the menu using new routing - the requirement is to build it from a json result from webapi service results.... 

issue: with grid? 
solution: but when it is tried in actual project with kendogrid, then facing issues with dynamic loading also...and passing/consuming the@inputvariable values. 

issue: what would cause this? [<-CODE->] 
solution: looks like u put <router-outlet> inside ngIf. or other structural directive. 

issue: is it possible to do ngModel to an array ? 
solution: Or you are just asking in general, not regarding my issue?. it's a different question man sorry. 

issue: do u really think something changes after release? ;) 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: this is what I was looking for! see how sexy is this !!! [<-LINK->]. DzmitryShylovich: have you used the select from ng2-mdl? I noticed that it doesn't update the visibly selected value until you manually change it. 

issue: Doesanyonehave a working draggable div example in current Angular 2? 
solution: 

issue: store in a service or in the payload of a routerlink 
solution: TaimurAbdaal_twitter: ok. to use a service, you need to have the service being "provided" in the highest common denominator for all consumers.. 

issue: I'm gettingCannot find controleven though that control is 10000% there any ideas? 
solution: it does work on both places when I do[formControl]="form.find(item.slug).find(\'value\')", and it doesn\'t when I useformGroupNameon element above andformControlNameon the actual input... but only in one place.. must be a bug, but whatever, I\'m gonna use that find even though it\'s ugly. 

issue: Is there any reason why.nextwouldn't trigger an update? 
solution: 

issue: hi ,anybody know best documentation of angular 2 thanks 
solution: aadi160:  [<-LINK->]. not explained properly. aadi160: another that I've seen written for earlier versions and does not work right now. 

issue: is there a special way in angular 2 to make the minified version of JS files for production? 
solution: robertomaldonado: it's preferable to avoid direct dom manipulation where all possible for use with offline compiler, web workers, and universal. 

issue: With DynamicComponentLoader deprecated how would one dynamically load a component into another template? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: I guess my use case might not fall into typical use.  I am using google maps api v3, and creating an info window which is generating new DOM.  I would like to suck a component in and insert it into the info window.. 

issue: router config via rest? :) 
solution: is it possible? because the number of items cant be fixed..it should be feed from a service call. there was an issue about that. 

issue: what are u trying to accomplish? 
solution: ilennert: nonsense. well like I said, if there wasn't an angular way. but there is never a need to query the elements like that. 

issue: [disabled]="!userForm.valid"looks good. doesn\'t work? 
solution: When enter something, delete that, and then tab away, it says it is required. 

issue: hoorayyyy [<-LINK->] 
solution: robwormald: wow, I didn't even realize that was a problem.. alxhub: i just posted a plunk for it!@DzmitryShylovichi hope so!. 

issue: How can I use the latest router build? 
solution: Delie: Is there a way to use angular/router-builds?. You’ll probably need to use all the builds to make sure it works together though. 

issue: how would i get the location in this wrapper  [<-LINK->] 
solution: get location(): Location {return window.location;}. stijn26: there's angular location serviceimport {Location} from '@angular/common';. 

issue: Hi guys, I'm getting ready to launch the first really big angular2 app into prodution, but looking at the javascript timeline, the evaluate script of the whole bundle (300kB gzipped) takes 800ms, compared to the (more or less identical) AngularJS implementation that only took 40ms to evaluate this is quite a lot, any ideas?

issue: Anyone out there who can give me any information about "matchers" in my tests  in RC.4? 
solution: 

issue: inside of animations on a component can I access any properties on the Component? 
solution: I have a ‘closed’ and ‘open’ state where open changestopproperty. However, when it closes there’s no way for me to grab it’s old ‘top’ value and it just defaults to 0.. Here’s a gif for the time being of what the behaviour is.. 

issue: :O 
solution: 

issue: three backticks around your codeblock. 
solution: so like;<sidebar myFullHeight></sidebar>. or setthis.el = el.nativeElementin your constructor... 

issue: That’s what observables are for, no? 
solution: 

issue: Is there a type for@Componentclasses? 
solution: 

issue: the short answer is "because we made it less magical and more like javascript" 
solution: So the only way to notify the form that the underlying data has changed would be to attach an observable?. 

issue: CaptainCodeman:  [<-LINK->] - routing animations you were asking about i'm sort of terrible at CSS, so that could be improved, but that's the mechanic 
solution: 

issue: Hmm what is ngModule any docs on what it will be? ty 
solution: note that that's an internal design doc, and not generally written for public consumption. human-readable docs are being written :). 

issue: how would I go about getting the current value from an observable? Is there a better way than subscribing, get the value and then unsubscribe? 
solution:

solution: @xvs32x there is no better / worser backendi would go with php (laravel or symphony) and implement the real-time stuff in nodeif you want to go all-in node i suggest hapi.js, this should get you started: https://github.com/codewareio/hapi.js-apiit features user auth + todo app routes, the persistence layer is in mongo. 

issue: anyone got a plunker with new forms? nvm, made one 
solution: yes, that would probably work, but the point is, the actual value of a checkbox is out of sync with the value inside FormControl uponchangeorclickevent, which sounds like a bug to me. 

issue: Does anyone have any idea on what could cause this? [<-CODE->] 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: If i had a 50 possible colors i would need 50 classes?. 

issue: Can I subscribe to component.changeDetection? 
solution: 

issue: does anyone know the correct way to implement a 'redirect if...' with the router 3? 
solution: gibo: use a guard [<-LINK->]. mlc-mlapis: well if example, if i navigated to /users, and i was logged out, i'd need to be redirected to /login. mlc-mlapis: i've used guards before, but could i call router.navigate within a guard?. 

issue: Does anyone have ANY clue why require is not defined when running unit tests with Karma 
solution: 

issue: Is it possible to use Angular 2 components as a row in a table?  It seems that <template> tags are now allowed in tables. 
solution: cquillen2003: seems like overkill, but technically you could always add an ngFor to a tr element and go from there. cquillen2003: you need to use attrbute as  selector instead of element name. rbnzdave: For inline editing, temporarily changing a row into a form component seems like a logical use case.. 

issue: Is this the Angular 1 or 2 channel? 
solution: andreasonny83: Angular1 channel is: [<-LINK->]. Angular2 is fine. 

issue: so why do u choose angular2 if it's in beta? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: Not "this is freaking instable, stay away you fool". 

issue: possible to do optional parameters in the router? 
solution: 

issue: Hi - is there a way to wait for element to be present in angular2. I usengAfterViewInit()for the initial load which works fine. But after user interaction the element goes away and is recreated based on new data...at this point angular does not know the element exists or not right now i have resorted tosetTimeout()which I don't like there must be a angular way 
solution: csreddy: (1) create an event emitter on the child component as an@Output(2) add an onInit to the child component that emits a value into the event emitter to say that it exists(3) if you need to know that it's been removed, add an onDestroy and emit another event saying it's been removed(4) add a listener to the parent component for that event emitter and respond accordingly. 

issue: Karma seems to have deprecated jasmine descriptions like "describe"; "it", "beforeEach". What happened with those and what should be used now? 
solution: But if fails to provide the explanation in said package.... my bad, it describes there that it's deprecated since you can just use the jasmine globals. 

issue: Is there a way to store data between components  in angular 2 like a common map so that i can save common objects inside application and clear it when logout 
solution: I just wanted someone to confirm that this isnt supposed to work... However, I find that this would be useful in that child components could have very short  selectors but still prevent selector collisions with other components.... 

issue: have u seen rc5 changelog? :) 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: you mentioned the rc.5 changelog - where might I find that?. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: brandonroberts: removed router-deprecated and rewrote all components to use latest router. 

issue: Anyone know the minimum firefox version one could get ng2 to work in? 
solution: 

issue: Doeas it possible to usethis.fooinside forEach ? [<-CODE->] 
solution: Delie: angular's already had problems with bundle size without momentjs :). DzmitryShylovich: heh, yeah, very good point.  In fact, I was kinda reluctant to add momentjs to my own app, because of adding to the bundle size too - so i might just have to make a dateutils service with only the bits i need - i guess i was just being lazy ;). 

issue: seems like beforeEachProviders() has been deprecated, can any one suggest instead of beforeEachProviders() what should we use ? 
solution: 

issue: What is the import for canActivateChild? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] I want to pass dynamic value to the  " displayName  " 
solution: vishalgajjar: You can use your own service provider via setting "resolve: { my: GlobalConfigResolver } " on any route.. 

issue: is there a demo about how to create a modal-dialog the angular way is so annoying。 
solution: 

issue: email.valid && email.pristine  ? 
solution: 

issue: dchacke: Use this template - is based on latest RC4. Any other version does not have sense. 
solution: also, I just found out that if I remove thengIffrom my child component, the ngOnDestroy hook is triggered just fine. 

issue: so? u want to rewrite your app every week? 
solution: well according to ng2 I have to the last couple of months. yeah but its no leading for release, I hope rc.5 is the last one with major breaking deprecating and depressing changes... within an Release Candidate.. 

issue: Hi, I have a problem with angular. Should I post it here or talk with someone on PM? 
solution: rledinski099_twitter: well systemjs tries to load traceur. I have seen the error before but don't remember the solution. What types of modules are you using? Are you using the module flag when compiling? What is your target?. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] why its not working ? 
solution: @DzmitryShylovich The double router-outlet?I am new to Angular 2 but I would expect something like this [<-CODE->]. 

issue: Anyone know a good way to create an authentication service to grant the user access to specific route paths only based on some logic? I guess@DzmitryShylovichwill knows the answer as usual Great presentation yesterday@kara:) 
solution: of course@DzmitryShylovichbut I was looking into something more detailed. From that tutorial I cannot really understand the advantages and side effects of using CanActivate. I read sowhere around the web that using canactivate is kind of bad practice because you cannot really be in control of that. I’d rather use a service for managing the authentication rules but I don’t know exactly how to put that service logic in between my app logic and the router service. 

issue: Hey, anyone here built e-learning courses with angular before? Currently experimenting with diff frameworks 
solution: CarlMungazi: so I'm off to a meeting now, so if you're trying to implement a platform for e-learning courses you should check out Model-Driven forms (aka. Reactive forms)  they are the way to implement dynamic forms in Angular 2 (quite cool!). 

issue: mlc-mlapis: Yes. The user must login before reaching any paths but root. 
solution: 

issue: Hi. Whats the RC.5 ETA? 
solution: I think they're trying to make sure ngModules is working perfectly so they don't have to release a bunch of bug fixes right away. 

issue: redux or not? :-) 
solution: 

issue: hello everyone , I'm getting data from webservices using Observable . When I want to use the array of Doctors , I get error (Doctors undefined ) , this is the gist : [<-LINK->] , i need some help please 
solution: 

issue: 281330:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: willvincent: may i ask a quick question. i guess my question is how would i go about doing something like this. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: johanhar: angular2 was splitted in several packages starting from RC. 

issue: Hey@javagaba, check out this video [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] my form s not submitting what wrong i am doing... :( 
solution: 

issue: how to update to new version of angular 2? 
solution: I'd run through the quickstart guide, get that up and running, and then move your bits into that... there were quite a few changes from the beta to the current rc4 version [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Hi, does anybody know if the router choose a component to activate depending upon e.g user roles? 
solution: For e.g, for route path 'dashboard', initiate AdminDashboard for admin or UserDashboard for regular users. 

issue: Hi, anyone know if it is possible to access activatedRoute from a Parent/root component/service? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: it is not an instance of ActivatedRoute right?. DzmitryShylovich: I know, but if I inject it ia root component, I will not get the current ActivatedRoute, I'll get same every time. 

issue: Anyone have a link to a good tutorial for server side rendering Angular 2? 
solution: bhargav-sae: yeah, that is what I am trying to use now! but i am lack of knowledge for angular-universal.. have u succeed updating to latest router?. 

issue: 281330: import { SomeComponent } from '../index'; 
solution: 

issue: I created custom date pipe to debug [<-CODE->] 
solution: MurhafSousli: serialize date as a number for example. DzmitryShylovich: I even tried to usedate.now(). sovalueis not a valid date in safari and u need to change it. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: qdouble: In your example I see{ path: 'lazy1', loadChildren: 'app/module1#LazyModuleOne' },and on similar lines I have{ path: 'admin', loadChildren: 'app/admin/admin.module#AdminModule' }, But I am getting error. 

issue: error Message? The reason why you have redirected? 
solution: just have a shared dataservice among all three  components, which will have a field for error message. 

issue: my app always get null request  when production is enabledenableProdMode()does anyone have the same issue? 
solution: 

issue: Doctrine doesn't register repositories inside entities, they're separate things right? 
solution: Well you can handle circular dependencies in JS and from what I know referencing something just for the type does not introduce a runtime dependency. 

issue: can anyone tell me difference between *State and "model", both are interfaces, where and can be nested right? im little confused 
solution: 

issue: can directives have a stylesheet? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: nponiros: , the problem is that theget.timeoutfunction does not exist. We do not need to import. vinaychandra: observables don't have all there methods defined by default (depends on the initial import). Have you triedimport 'rxjs/add/operator/retryWhen';?. 

issue: I want to usefirebasewith angular2 so what should if useangularFireorangularfire2 ? 
solution: so how should i change my pipe regex so that it should make like this. dixitthareja: you can try something like this [<-CODE->]. 

issue: hey guys, what's the best way to set up an internal api? all of the services that I've looked at use external endpoints 
solution: 

issue: anyone know when a form becomes "touched"? 
solution: touched/untouched is on blur but it doesn't work yet for containers. 

issue: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token import ? do any one have idea about this error 
solution: 

issue: Is there any way to createBehaviorSubjectwithout initial value? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: PhilippSchaffrath: this is what google says [<-LINK->] 
solution: nponiros: i have seen this already, but you cannot use components inside those modals, like i said, for example i want a fully functional login form inside a dialog, or a registration form. PhilippSchaffrath: well is should work with components but perhaps not exactly the way you want it too or maybe I don't really get the problem.. Maybe you can adjust the code so it matches your needs... 

issue: Sorry; I don’t get when do I have to call the service in the child component to have the equivalent of this instruction: [<-CODE->] So Angular can say “Oh someone else changed the ‘myInput’ I need to refresh the view" 
solution: So here is what I just did:1) I have an “applicationService” that stores my array of data and has the get/set methods [<-CODE->] 2) I have the child component that injects the AppService using DI [<-CODE->] 3) Finally in the template of this child component I put something like: [<-CODE->]. 

issue: sodirectivesandpipesare completely going away for@Component? 
solution: Now if I could only get rid of this “experimental decorators” warning in VSCode… ;). alxhub: a tsconfig option that doesn't work in VS 2015 unfortunately. you can get rid of it in vs2015 too. 

issue: So re: NgModules - would I make each of my NgModules its own npm package?  Or is this just a lazy-loading app-centric concept? 
solution: 

issue: 2. 
solution: 

issue: PascalPrecht: are you currently online? I have a question about [<-ISSUE->] Or maybe someone else who knows the details ofChangeDetectorandDoCheck? 
solution: 

issue: When using [ngClass] is it possible to check if the control has a certain attribute such as readonly? 
solution: Conceivably, you could pass the result of a getter or function execution which checks the control. However, you'd have to code it carefully or you could easily make things inefficient.. 

issue: how can I get custom metadata for a method?reflectoris no more exported 
solution: I've created custom annotation to add metadata to some methods. decorator*. Gigitsu:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: d 
solution: 

issue: Can you put together a plunker? Easier to help debug that way 
solution: {{resolveName(someId) | async}}. But resolve name is being called infinitely. nvahalik: because every time change detection runs, you're getting a new instance of the promise, which resolves, and then fires change detection, and then the function gets called, and you get a new instance of the promise..... 

issue: im so annoyed people im vexed terribly vexed 
solution: nvahalik: no im annoyed at freecodecamp for fake advertisement, i have in the last 5 days changed how that site thinks. 

issue: webtrix: On iOS everyone uses Safari. Apple doesn't allow competing HTML renderers so even Chrome on iOS is just a reskinned Safari... 
solution: Chrome for iOS is derived from the WebKit browser codebase, as is Apple's Mobile Safari. However, while Apple allows only Safari to access iOS facilities like the iOS Nitro engine, Chrome uses Apple's UIWebView for loading and rendering content. Any of the considerations for UIWebView apply to Chrome for iOS. See the Chrome Mobile FAQ for more information.. 

issue: Is there are way to loop through a formgroup’s controls? 
solution: for (let control of this.form.controls)something like this I guess. javagaba:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: is there any short writeup about rc5 ngModules? 
solution: 

issue: Morning,@sam-s4s. We baked you an RC5 while you were asleep. 
solution: It has a delicious icing made of NgModules and the center's filled with stable APIs.. I shall have to set up a nice rc5 sandbox after I finish fixing this old angular 1 problem... lol. 

issue: you still can combine gulp and webpack right? 
solution: webpack is very specialized in module bundling/loading. vrustia-owens: yep, pretty much :) But luckily you can use webpack by itself, so you don't need to run it inside gulp (but you can). And there are lots of plugins, so you can usually get other tasks done inside webpack (like copying files, etc.). 

issue: my website is taking too much time to loadsmscampaign.co.ukit is in rc2 
solution: sumedha-navin: bundling and minification, you website has almost 9mb and needs 600 requests. 

issue: Hi Can anybody offer me some guidance on using Underscore in Angular2? 
solution: Verlet64: For me it is working fine. Are you having any specific problems? I just did anpm install --save lodashand thenimport * as _ from 'lodash'wherever I am using it.. 

issue: Have anyone here any experience with@vaadin/angular2-polymer ? 
solution: It seems perfect for my needs, is there anything specific I should watch out for?. 

issue: Hi guys! Can I use a variable from my component in my component-css? :) 
solution: 

issue: why is@angular/testing on version 0.0.0-0 ? 
solution: 

issue: I can't seem to hint the type of a weakmap. Any ideas why? [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Has anyone encounteredProperty 'map' does not exist on type 'Observable<Response>'while compiling after migrating to RC5? 
solution: 

issue: And you have #mytextarea on the element in html? 
solution: this.textarea.nativeElement.focus();. 

issue: Yup, but I wonder how performant it is compared to changing a boolean when the route changes? 
solution: no problem... How does@HostBindingcheck if the value is changed? It's probably polled (very often?). so it's slightly slower, since now it checks the route if it matches on every change cycle, instead of just checking a boolean... (Not like I'm going to care very much about that right now, but interresting to know :) ). 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] My app module imports the RpgModule that imports RpgRouting I'm obviously doing it wrong, the critical question is, how? 
solution: 

issue: any know an ETA of the next release of angular cli? 
solution: kemmis_twitter: You know you can grab the master from github withnpm install angular/angular-cli. 

issue: do u import ReactiveFormsModule? 
solution: 

issue: I'm unable to find any documentation on the let- property, any explanation or reference? 
solution: robwormald: so this was only occuring with components that had styles defined.. must be something with my webpack build.. nm. 

issue: I am a beginner in this can you please teach me basics of this 
solution: And then in the menu on the left is the Heroes tutorial - that's a good starting point. 

issue: Answered your own question hehe :D 
solution: Well, something right now is happening that's entirely problematic.... I have a registration form that submits a field that is expected, no 400 error (wrong syntax) at all. 

issue: Any suggestion on this issue? [<-LINK->] 
solution: robinkedia: I've wondered stuff like that too... my idea (untested) is to have a click event on the body... if the target/element is inside the multi-select, then return true - if not, return false.... 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: yeah, thought so, so even if it does support formdata now, it's still kinda useless for uploads. 

issue: Default from the router? 
solution: 

issue: the compiler-cli generated code for our ~100 components app is about 1,3MB minified. Is this expected or is there something wrong? 
solution: sod: I don't think the compiler by itself reduces the size that much, you still have to do treeshaking... although 1.2megs turns into about 275k for me gzipped. 

issue: Could someone recommend a good UI components for angular2 beginner? 
solution: tomasocz_twitter: Material 2 is in alpha but very nice, otherwise materialize or ngprime, there are webpack repos ready for use. 

issue: Can I retrieve the name of the parent in a FormControl? 
solution: I want to make a requiredWhenVisible validation that looks into a big object depending in the control's and its parents name. 

issue: I just use the@nextcommand, are you trying to target a specific beta? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: unless you install it globally, you may have to tell your ide to use local version. 

issue: is JSONP_PROVIDERS still valid in rc.5 and onwards? 
solution: there's a JsonpModule. no PipeModules right? what Module is part of? Form?. 

issue: what is #var? 
solution: 

issue: Is there a way I can set the port used forHttprequests? 
solution: 

issue: Is it better to import all modules in AppModule ? or to load it separately with loadChildren ? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: but what i don't like with loadChildren is that i always need first route to beredirectTo:and give name to default Module route. 

issue: Where do I get started with angular2? 
solution: VikrantSingh13:  [<-LINK->]. VikrantSingh13: There's the quick start, as mentioned above. I personally love Maximilian Schwarzmüller's series on Angular at [<-LINK->] . There's a fee though. He does a really good job of building a solid foundation of knowledge, moreso I think thank the quickstart or many tutorials do.. 

issue: anyone here bundling their app using systemJS build tool?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: robwormald: cool, it works well? trying to make the call if its beneficial to switch to webpack now or keep our gulp process and add on system js builder. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] anyone knows why my params snapshot is empty 
solution: 

issue: Hello, how do I mock http?  The example [<-LINK->] doesn't seem like it's up to date (I'm using RC5) 
solution: psurrey: yes,TestBedhas replaced almost everything. Here's a good link: [<-LINK->] , and [<-LINK->] on how to mock the router. Still usesprovideRoutes()unfortunately. 

issue: brandonroberts: :: I am getting thiss error , do you have some solution for this ? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 14Muhammad: looks like you’re missing the providers for theNoteyour’re trying to inject. brandonroberts: We just upgraded to NgModules concept (.., feature, shared modules,  ...). I have to say that we are very satisfied with it. Just great! We still use SystemJS loader and it works fine with module lazy loading on routes. The performance is good and there is a bonus of AOT in future, so nice to work on it. Thanks.. 

issue: Can somebody help me with naming conventions for interfaces? The official style guide doesn't cover it that well. 
solution: 

issue: quick question: If I have something in the providers of a module, do I need to write :import {x} from '...'in the component anymore? 
solution: roby2001: if you need to use it in the component class, yes.. roby2001: the module imports deal with stuff you are going to use directly in the view...for everything else, just do like normal. 

issue: how long? 
solution: So it knows which properties are valid to bind and which aren't.. 

issue: can u reproduce in plunker? 
solution: 

issue: NgModule was released in rc5 
solution: damoncasale: did you close and reopen ide after installing rc5?. 

issue: Anyone usesangular-cli@webpackhere? 
solution: 

issue: Hi all, is it possible for components to register to a FormGroup? From what I understand \'form\' must be instantiated in <form [formGroup]="form">. However, at that time I do not know what form elements will be created. 
solution: 

issue: has anyone here used the material2 slider with rc5? 
solution: well your picture said not to do that. well, in context of your posting it.. 

issue: what's in the imports array? 
solution: Also importing BrowserModule, FormsModule, HttpModule and the routing.. 

issue: emm guys, the angular.io site is down? 
solution: 

issue: hmmm why dont you have the imports there like@qjleedumb question but just curious. i havent had time to migrate to rc5 
solution: 

issue: alxhub: still complaining about it after import FormModule 
solution: Yeah - you don\'t need to tightly couple your components to your customHttpclass. Just define your own "interface" (abstract class) forHttpand use that as the injection token.. 

issue: I'm using Webpack with RC5 and whenever I build for production I am getting many of these errors when I try and view my app. [<-CODE->] The app works fine on on development with no errors.  Any ideas? 
solution: brandonroberts: I looked at your plunker and a couple others for examples of named routes - I've tried several ways of writing the routerlink attribute including :[{outlets: {'main': ['view']}}]\n['main:view']\n['main', ['view']]but the named outlet is still overlaying the one at the top of the page [<-LINK->]. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: Isn't there a router event when navigation is not processed because of a guard that returned false? 
solution: 

issue: does same one have plunker with multi-providers? :-) 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: hmm.. I see it in the docs.. sry for asking.. I should have read that first :s. View child is set before the ngAfterViewInit callback is called.. it's just that when you load componentRef in your constructor that will work. 

issue: hi gusy, sorry for the spam, i got this weird stuff after rc5 upgrade, [<-CODE->] 
solution: Or, if it's a shared module and not your root app module,CommonModulefrom@angular/common?. 

issue: Do you have a shared module? 
solution: That looks right,@qjlee.. 

issue: Hi all, how can I install@angulartypings withtypings installcommand? I couldn't found the package 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys, is there a datepicker out there that's usable with rc5? 
solution: andregsilv: Well I've been using one which worked fine up until rc5, and I cannot seem to resolve the issues it has, so I thought maybe there is a better alternative out there.@enginehuzurThanks, I'll have a look! :). 

issue: saw a couple of these errors when doing component unit tests, any clue? [<-CODE->] 
solution: yeah, i don't know what move does, looks like you just change the index of an existing item within that vcref. snyderjk: take a look at portal service [<-LINK->]. DzmitryShylovich: I played with that on the changeDetectorRef, but I don't think that helps me moving across vcrefs. 

issue: is there anyway to bind to class across multiple elements like a $.each without using jquery or that jazz 
solution: 

issue: posting this here, because desperation: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: I've got a question concerning Validatos.  I have a validator like :  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] however, I will always get a TypeError: this.validator is not a functionDo you know what I am doing wrong ? thanks ! 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: I'd need to add more logic to the code, like attributes, that I'd need to be able to set afterwards, so a simple function would not work. Is a class not supported ?. 

issue: HI folk, [<-CODE->] how to set default value 0 as --Select--? 
solution: Iamguy84: which browser you are using? I think that <select> and in particular select in Angular2 did behave differently in Chrome than in Firefox, for example.. 

issue: ty@DzmitryShylovich... you are like to super supporter the* 
solution: SamiAl90: @DzmitryShylovichis just trying to land a job at Google HQ ;) ... but yes..@DzmitryShylovichis a really great guy, helps A LOT of people.. seems to have a lot of patience as well :) and a ton of knowledge to share :). 

issue: Hi, does anyone know how to add offline support to an angular 2 app?is there a library for that? 
solution: 

issue: have you tried changing the order of override and configure? alxhub: is this the thing we discovered the other day? 
solution: Is there a way to specify it in tests for the time being? It inherits fromDirectiveMetadataTypewhich hasinputsdefined.... 

issue: then [<-CODE->] and then a constructor in the service that takes the 3 params.Is this the most elegant way we can do this at the mo ? 
solution: i typically use a configobject, vs a string, which makes it easier to work with. 

issue: DzmitryShylovich: any tips on how I can achieve that? 
solution: RicardoVaranda: Yeah that is a bummer. It's hard to know exactly what's going on, but ideally you'd only use*ngIfand could abstract out the need to keep DOM reference with a service or something. I know that's not very helpful to you right now though.. 

issue: any blogs/resources aboutngcyou guys could point me to? 
solution: saw that - don't really see any info about the the command itself. It does a great job of explaining about the whole process. mithun-daa:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Hi.. does anyone seen this before in RC1? Error: coreLoadAndBootstrap is deprecated. Use bootstrapModule instead. 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] I'm on RC5 with TS 1.8.10.  Why would that be happening? 
solution: rakibler:  [<-LINK->]. rakibler: Kara just specified incorrect type. 

issue: [value] ? 
solution: 

issue: what's the meaning of ngDefaultControl? if I don't add to my control I have this errorNo value accessor for form control with name: 'idProvincia' 
solution: I don't know why but if I add ngDefaultControl the error disappear but the ControlValueAccessor events are not called, and the select inside is not selcted with the value in the ngModel. 

issue: anyone experienced migration to rc5? 
solution: MurhafSousli: yeah..... I think I asked. this is driving me crazy. 

issue: uh, where do I put angular pipes to modules? 
solution: uum..The pipe 'async' could not be found [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] zone.js:269Uncaught Type AsyncPipe is part of the declarations of 2 modules: CommonModule and SharedModule!. 

issue: Is there something like ng-non-bindable in angular2? 
solution: 

issue: I'm trying to have a dynamically loaded component get content from a <ng-content> I get [<-LINK->] which is normal from what I understood, but I don't see how I could do this correctly. Would somebody have a clue ? 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys! can anyoune send me a link to a plnkr working with the current HEAD? 
solution: choeller: It looks that there are not exactly definitions for A2 resources loading for R5 - it uses a general template.. seems like the core builds are not up to date... as [<-LINK->] still contains exceptions import and this changed to "errors" in master. 

issue: goodday to you all:Q: Iam I right that there is no official documentation about reactive / model driven forms? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: : it says: That's not the only way to create a form but it's the way we'll cover in this chapter. == template driven. 

issue: Type MeetingItemComponent is part of the declarations of 2 modules: DashboardModule and ClientsModule!why is this a problem? uh, so when I want to use it in multiple places I have to create a module for it? that's new, so every component needs a module? 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys, can anyone give me a hint on how to check if the ngContent part of a Component contains a special tag. I have a template like this: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Ah, just realized that the string passed to ContentChild is refering to a local template variable... so is it even possible to inject elements by CSS-Selector into the component? OK - it's not possible right now ;) found this issue where the topic is discussed [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: can you explain what is rc?? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I was wondering if you can include file-blobs/byte-stream in the body of a http.post request? I knew it wasn't possible in the [<-LINK->] , what about rc5? Did they fixed that? 
solution: webtrix: currently you can only add string in the input. As a result you can't send files since you can't turn them merely into a string.. 

issue: water42: , what's the selector for your directive? Ah, it's in the stack overflow. 
solution: You would need a selector ofmy-tree-layout,[my-tree-layout]to match either version.. 

issue: Does anyone have experience with AOT and Windows? Running into issues and we are shipping product soon. 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] OR [<-CODE->] 
solution: As ambiguous of an answer as I would have expected ;). Benjman: It was the answer to st else .... Benjman: The difference between is that the first return returns just static value and the second an observable that will changed over time.. 

issue: alright... this sounds good. [<-CODE->] Now I need to figure out how to convey these custom actions which are dynamically determined by the state of current component... [<-CODE->] 
solution: oytuntez: You could also make a static function in your navbar that updates whatever state you need, then setup a getter in the navbar component to update the view. But that might be difficult to manage.. brandonbird: , I would loooooove to let it be managed by component\'s themselves. I want to define that area as a free area where components can use for numerous purposes: action menu (New - Listkind of component-related buttons), status bar ("You are viewing the account of John Smith" or "Accounts > John Smith"). 

issue: How to use Async pipe with a Promise that resolves to an Object (instead of a string)? [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: I would like to useSubjectorBehaviorSubjectinstead ofEventEmitter, is this possible? [<-CODE->] 
solution: MurhafSousli: , no, useEventEmitter.. Because the API for@Outputis anEventEmitter.. it probably technically works, and its something i'd like to allow, but as of now its officially not-supported. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: meorfi: Singelton service that cmps get via DI could be one solution.. mlc-mlapis: :) I thought about Singleton and about storing config result in cookies.... meorfi: BehaviourSubject as an observable that cmps subscribe to as the second one.. 

issue: How can I simulate form element to have "ng-dirty" class in tests? 
solution: 

issue: :D 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: so getPerson() is getting called more frequently than you think it should? 
solution: It seems like it started doing it when I moved to RC5.. It likely is staying alive.. 

issue: Hi, does any one know how to inspect the template string for a structural directive??? TemplateRef just has a reference to a Comment tag. 
solution: bvkimball: You can't really as content of a template is inert till inserted. As soon as you insert it (via createEmbeddedTEmplate) you can query directives.. 

issue: why not use ng2-material in angular2 offical tour ? 
solution: MurhafSousli: hmm,thks!I already implement table\\modal\\tooltip\\form use angular2,it looks like there is still a long way to go....... 

issue: i did 
solution: 

issue: no.  where? 
solution: 

issue: Anyone have ever used InMemoryDbService? 
solution: 

issue: Could anyone help out with this issue? [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: ok understood. so in angular2 to track and notify a progress bar  what do you suggest to use? 
solution: Services comes from every module, providers in modules will be global. 

issue: hi folks, [<-CODE->] how to check if res.josn() is empty or not?? 
solution: Iamguy84: you can check for null, undefined, and array length 0. 

issue: Is there a good guide anywhere on writing custom form validators? 
solution: kosiakMD: Just plain angular 2. The guides I do find use the form builder which is sorta deprecated as of rc-4.. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] is how you should do it 
solution: Tribex: , while I don't doubt that works, it's kind of akin to swimming up a waterfall. You'll be fighting the framework so much that you might be better off choosing a tool more suited to your task.. 

issue: can I say that the use of ts barrel files are redundant now that we have NgModules? 
solution: ayemaung: Yes. And they could create new problems.. ayemaung: you don't really need to use them...and they can cause circular dependency issues and chunk size when lazy loading  bundled chunks. ayemaung: I use barrels for components and services separately, I import * from my components barrel and then add those to my module's declarations (and exports usually). 

issue: you mean insert your own html into someone else's? :P 
solution: sam-s4s: : yes it is rendering outside the forim. without create new tag <MYCOMPONENT>.... But inside, without having access to inside.... 

issue: Please no breaking changes please no breaking changes 
solution: harangue: most breaking changes are just deprecated stuff being removed. 

issue: make sure you have the latest of everything 
solution: 

issue: someone to get my plunk working [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Once i got success from tests, next time it fails [<-LINK->] 
solution: qdouble: it seams that is very hard to test components that use a lot of services and other components.... Simple one with few imports, providers are fine,. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] 
solution: Yeah, I had to completely eliminate HTTP_PROVIDERS because the error is stating that the index.js doesn't have that class as an export. and I just checked the source code and, of course the error is right, and I looked into it and it seems HttpModule replaced that. 

issue: woah, HTTP_PROVIDERS is deprecated?  :-/ 
solution: wz2b: use HttpModule in your NgModule import. I import HttpModule as a 'provider' in my ngModule then anywhere I want I can just inject Http ?. wz2b: close.. but not as a 'provider', as an 'import'. 

issue: are barrels no longer a recommended approach in rc.5+? 
solution: yeah, they can cause you to have undefined imports...and I notice that with lazy loading, it increases the size of your chunks...so not good to use them to heavily anymore imo. 

issue: Hi guys, just realized angular-cli is not supporting rc.6 atm. so ignore my question from above ;) 
solution: I don't really know, I always build the cli from master withnpm linkbut I think when you already installed the webpack-version globally you don't need to install it again. 

issue: isiti: send me the link again to the image. 
solution: brandonroberts: this is my strucutre maybe I cant acces from app.component to my route but how can I get this maybe with an eventemitter or what. brandonroberts: on it don't works when I log window.location the pathname is still tab1. 

issue: release party? 
solution: I couldn't say. robwormald: you don't know :D. 

issue: brandonroberts: As an aside, it wasn't constructor vs ngonit. I set the@Componentas  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush, which is what caused the problem. 
solution: Hopefully people see my comment and are extra careful when going on OnPush as change detection, as there will be trade offs.. 

issue: so unfortunately this is what I ended up with for my modal.. not what I'd like, but it works [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: Hello. Anybody interested in talking about providers and NgModules ? see my previous question! 
solution: qdouble: I have this error A function whose declared type is neither 'void' nor 'any' must return a value.. istiti: as I said last time you can subscribe or use map on a function, which you are still doing. 

issue: I'm excited about final API so people can start building the next level of the platform 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] card detail : [<-CODE->] and finally : [<-CODE->] for some reason the card.name isnt changed 
solution: 

issue: hi...anyone knows how  import component by string path  in last angular release version ? 
solution: I cant... because i need to   get component name from service...you know how can i send parameters in route ?@mlc-mlapis. i neet get the component name from url parameters like this : localhost:803/Admin >>> so i have to find admin component in specific path  and load it into the form... thanks for helping@mlc-mlapis. 

issue: can you make a repo of your project? 
solution: 

issue: Anyone alive here? 
solution: 

issue: in an argument at work. underscores on private vars. yes or no ? The styleguide ( [<-LINK->] ) says no, just want to get some reasons for why people should be using them. 
solution: sam-s4s: yeah that would be private variables that you are exposing via getters and setters. Do you still reference variables inside your classes without accessor functions ?. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: this is the base of my problem. but I see he uses datastore to save so maybe this will help ! thanks again. 

issue: Hello,@hkati! 
solution: 

issue: Why does binding toinput type="range"turn my variables tostring? Is this desired? 
solution: 

issue: Morning. Anybody able to offer a newbie a bit of help on observables? 
solution: I have a method which looks like this [<-CODE->] This was returning a promise before. The idea is that I really only need that one value from it so I am not sure I should be using an Observable here but I would like it to be asynchronous. 

issue: How can I use ngIf to check if observable has or has not value? using async pipe 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: ericmartinezr:  [<-LINK->]. it was fun by then. written for april's fool, I read 'angular3' and I remembered that joke. 

issue: is there anything wrong with this: [<-CODE->] ? [<-CODE->] 
solution: monojack: It all has to do with CORS policy. Before any request, Chrome was doing a preflight OPTIONS request, which should be handled and acknowledged by the server prior to the actual request.. 

issue: hello, have anyone tryed to use checkbox in rc 6 ? 
solution: i am trying to implement checkbox question object, to use it in dynamic forms, and i cant get checked value returned. i used code from angular.io Dynamic forms tutorial. 

issue: why does the router has  not state name? using the path is not good 
solution: mlc-mlapis: Yes, I think :), I need addition alias before the id category and article. 

issue: how to set class name using parameter dynamically in html ? 
solution: binarious: bit if i want dymaically set the class name ?. 

issue: anyone knows of an angular2 numeric stepper component? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: ha no, more like up and down number selector. born2net: how\'s that different from<input type="number">. 

issue: hiti want to read data from dropdown menu. how can i read the menu text that clicked? *hi 
solution: farshidmk: use (click)="setData(someData)" or [(ngModel)]="$event" depending on the component you use.. tomreinartz90: I want to create 2 dropdown menu and user select that then send the selected ones to website and get the answer back and show them. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] 
solution: juanmaflyer: Key is of type string, value of type Mapping. Without the brackets, you're specifying the name of the property.. juanmaflyer:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: hi all, could you pls share me: how to implement the Google Analytics / Tag Manager  to app? 
solution: But unless you type the exact right thing (which you usually don't know what it is) that is the TITLE of the doc you're looking for, you get nothing.. 

issue: What is the best way to sort items in aselectvia*ngFor? I'm thinking customPipe, but wanted to get external validation :) 
solution: So for example, if you're pulling some data from HTTP and you're only ever using it in that sorted scenario - there's no reason not to just sort it during the Observable phase. But if you're using it with different sorts orders in different places, then pipes are great. 

issue: Where are the weekly meeting notes? 
solution: nicholasleblanc: For this week, I mean :P. lukealization_twitter: labor day. 

issue: Is there a way to push a state change to the router, but not navigate? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: So cant push to history?. 

issue: Comp Parent Has child Comp B. Once the page is loaded for comp parent. Anyway on click of button i can again destroy child and recreate it? 
solution: Angular is behaving wierd with rc6. I have create, edit, delete and so many scenarios. The textbox disabled state doesnt go away after playing around on the screen. Its been happening witg rc6. I cannot put in plunker as its huge app. I was thinking to destroy child and init again if user clicks any action button like create edit etc and then open child modal popup. 

issue: I want to set APP_BASE_HREF but I don't know how to access 'window.location' from typescript .... 
solution: I can do that, but if it's on the server in let's say /app1  or /app3   or /demo   then it won't work. I want it to be able to dynamically figure it out. I did (so far) exactly what you said .. as a provider.  But I don't know how i could psosibly inject Location into that. 

issue: so rc6 eh... we thinking we'll have like what... 10 rcs? 
solution: ronnyek: Yes and each one will be a rewrite :P. I feel like Google issued a RC deadline so they were likeshugokay wish granted. You would expect some kind of feature freeze yeah. 

issue: Does anyone know how to define a route with queryparams like this:foobar/?secret=<secret>? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: did you found something aboutform.reset()to default values? Different sites state that it will set it to apristinestate which I understand as setting it to my default values i specified with the formbuilder/formgroup. 

issue: Anyone getting this after upgrading to RC6? 
solution: 

issue: anybody deal with safari and gzipping? On chrome/firefox, it appears to get the gzipped file, but on Safari it seems to be receiving the uncompressed file. I've got my complete app down to 180KB, but it's transferring like 1MB in Safari :( . Using express server. 
solution: 

issue: is it transferring 1mb with dev tools closed as well? 
solution: 

issue: How to convert SubjectObservable to observable? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. rledinski099_twitter: .asObservable(). 

issue: How can I hint my method to accept one of two argument sets? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: Any one got a good example of ngClass? 
solution: Minor stupid issues on my part mis-reading them.. It doesn’t like-in css class names.. 

issue: it can only be declared in one module 
solution: vivdkool: you can use a component in as many modules as you want, but it can only be declared in one module...if you need to use it in multiple modules, then wrap that component in a module and then share that module. Or put a bunch of commonly used components inside a shared module's exports.. 

issue: and your selector is correctly defined as app ? not, say... my-app ? and you're exporting your AppComponent ? 
solution: heh usually is :D. 

issue: anybody have a good plunker to start from? 
solution: @DzmitryShylovich  Here's a plunker:  http://plnkr.co/edit/APZ3MGrMBZegBc4xQ7ZE?p=previewRight beside the input is the value from the form, and if you click the button, it logs the entire form to console for easy inspectino. rakibler: looks like u incorrectly implement ControlValueAccessor interface. I cannot even type into input. 

issue: Q: On an@Inputof type Observable<T> is  ngOnChanges not triggered? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: I know. But the debugger never reaches there, even the first time.. DzmitryShylovich: No it is not. It depends on what you want to do.. 

issue: Solved it nm 
solution: RWOverdijk: instanceof. I had to simply accept it as the same type I was providing. I derped a bit. 

issue: So does the interpolation work forstylesin RC6? 
solution: rizwanhussain-vteams: don't think so. with css interpolation it would be not possible to use css preprocessors. 

issue: anyone know why they addedModuleWithProvidersto all the routers in the angular 2 plunker example? 
solution: aBitNomadic: as a good practice for lazy loading I think. DzmitryShylovich: Cool, I just could not find any reference to it in the doc's. Been wondering if I should add it to my routers. 

issue: Hi there Angularians!Does anyone know when there will be a final release of Angular2 (lets say version 1)? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] My pipe looks like this [<-CODE->] 
solution: I know, but I don't want to do that. We'll be using the date pipe all over the place and specifying the format everywhere is a no-go. 

issue: Okay put the stars here but not here or app explodes but do the opposite on the other thing Reminds me of PHP not having consistent argument order between similar functions 
solution: I understand that a star wraps a <template> and a template represents a document fragment. No one except for some gurus are going to think about it through the underlying View/EmbeddedView/ViewContainer/EmbeddedTemplate point of view.  Someone may very well think "I want my ngSwitch to be a logical control structure, not a wrapper, the templates in my ngSwitchCase can hold the actual structural output". 

issue: @poke need reproduction [<-CODE->] Here’s a RC6 version with the same behavior: [<-LINK->] 
solution: poke: works as expected withsetInterval(() => this.texts$.next('ff'), 8000);. 

issue: Hi, I have a problem when try to test a component in angular rc6, I think that is a problem when I try to do the keep import of@angular/core/testing because when I try to do the test in angular rc5 this import works, but I don't have idea of how do test now with rc6, someone had this problem, or know some about this? 
solution: AlexSerrano22: one of the things that caught me with my pants down was the deprecation of the old shims and polyfill libraries and the switch to  core-js for fills.  My tests were originally failing to create the test bed environment because of a missing DI component, but it wasn't clear what was missing.. 

issue: The import doesn't work in RC6? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: ndcunningham: controls is an object. DzmitryShylovich: but would that be the right thing to send to a pipe?form.controls?. 

issue: where is DynamicComponentLoader now? 
solution: 

issue: is SystemJS required to lazy load routes? 
solution: 

issue: dynamically? 
solution: seems like theres gonna be bootstrapping and potentially a fair bit of it with ng2. no inheritance, no decorator inheritance or@CustomComponent. 

issue: me 
solution: 

issue: Why I redirected to '/some?' not to '/some'? [<-CODE->] page full reloading:( 
solution: mlc-mlapis: this.router.navigate([\'/\', \'some\']) set current url to "/some?". Full page reloading, it is wrong.. 

issue: Hiya, how can I make a service available to components of child modules to my root appmodule? I am importing and including it my list of providers on the root appmodule. 
solution: 

issue: Hi, this is my first time here, I need some advice with a project I've been working on? 
solution: And I'm tasked to turn it into an app, I learnt the MEAN stack basics from a couple of books and tuts, but I need to get this running soon. 

issue: Hi, I would love to get some help here, can anyone tell me why this provider isn't loading properly?  [<-CODE->] Thanks so much. 
solution: 

issue: what version of typescript do I have to use for RC6? 
solution: 

issue: can I show you all my codes? 
solution: plunkers are the gold standard for all support seekers, of course. but this is the kind of thing wher eif you could plunk it you probably wouldn’t have a problem. 

issue: Why do I keep getting "Unknown compiler option \'moduleResolution\'." on npm start? 
solution: ericmartinezr: That fixed that error but now getting a lot of "Cannot find name \'IServiceProvider\'. ". 

issue: How can I trigger change detection manually? I have an eventEmitter calling a function on a parent component, and the function is being triggered, but none of the changes are applying... 
solution: 

issue: Can anyone please help me to solve the issue Error: Can't resolve all parameters for SigninService: (?).master ? As described here:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: in the  directive's class. There are plenty of other (click) callbacks in that class that work -- for other elements. Just not for <a>.. 

issue: one of your imports is undefined, by the look of it. can you log them out and see which ? 
solution: 

issue: how do u think? 
solution: 

issue: i am getting traceur.js not found error while i am using BrowserDomAdopter in'@angular/platform-browser/src/browser/browser_adapter'. 
solution: Okay.I will agree with you.But In case of  RC4, its working fine. In RC6 only ,it throws error..

solution: 

issue: How to manipulate the DOM in Angular 2 RC6? Could you tell me any idea? 
solution: it's probably still possible in a different way. Renderer will be helpful for me to access a dom element in angular2 rc6. 

issue: Someone has a simplest example of the use of the ngrx/store , the example that has on github is a bit confusing to me 
solution: masterloge: Have you looked at storing that state elsewhere (a service in your Core module would be a good place), so it doesn't matter if your component is cleaned up?. 

issue: piercers: Let me try. Do I need to add thehandleUpdatedData()to my component though? 
solution: piercers: in our use case we initially load a bunch of records to show. Some of the record fields should be "nicely" formatted so that this table appears readable.The record fields are displayed via <input> fields -- basically it\'s a form with inline edit enabled. User should be able to edit the values the way he/she wants, but if it\'s a valid value, it should be re-formatted to follow the initial pattern. For a bad value I could show a validation error. This is what my requirements look like.I have no idea at this point how to achieve it with Angular.. 

issue: is there seriously a rc7? le sigh  [<-LINK->] 
solution: np. ronnyek: to be fair rc.7 is essentially rc.6.1. so you are saying its essentially what rc's SHOULD be for the first time. 

issue: How can I search this room? 
solution: DfsdfsEricka_twitter: in google search for gitter angualr2. First link will take you to this room.. I want to search for a message in this room. DfsdfsEricka_twitter: have you tried [<-LINK->]. I tried earlier, guess I didn't wait long enough, thanks. 

issue: Hi, does anyone know how to enable  bootstrap's jquery-based features (like data-toggle/collapse)? I tried adding jquery to the root index.html file. It doesn't work. 
solution: ayemaung: . you also need to add bootstrap.css and bootstrap.js files in index page. 

issue: rc.7 is around the corner. Only 1 breaking change :) 
solution: core: - all …Metadata classes have been removed. Use the corresponding decorator as constructor or for instanceof checks instead.Example:Before: new ComponentMetadata(…)After: new Component(…)Note: new Component(…) worked before as well.. 

issue: is there a limit on a number of components that an NgModule can contain? 
solution: I get a Promise rejection: Template parse errors: 'date-picker' is not a known element. 

issue: Does anyone have a good resource for learning how to pass various data types into component properties/inputs. I'm having a hard time with numbers and bools. 
solution: 

issue: what should I do so I can user "require", I\'m geting an error "Cannot find name \'require\'"? 
solution: shral: Okay, haven\'t use that ever. But "require" is for Webpack. But as@ryanlangtonsuggested, that old school way to composite view templates is not recommended by any ways, nor needed.. 

issue: ist there a way to check inside a Directive, if the parent view is initialized? is it possible to useAfterViewInitinside a Directive? docs say no 
solution: AAAnderson7301: my problem is, that the parent element of my directive is a "bootstrap-row", and my directive which draws a chart renders in the wrong size, until i manual resize my browser.. so i thought i can solve this with a livecycle hook, dont want to use native dom.rdy function. 

issue: it is a component hahaha.. can I not do that? whyyyy 
solution: 

issue: can anyone help here? [<-LINK->] 
solution: no, you're doing a subscribe in the ngOnInit, and then another in your subscribe() function.

solution: 

issue: is there a simply "copy files" rollup task?ie. for non-compiled assets, such as images 
solution: I like the process over webpack for my dev environment. I dont like mixingrequire()with ES2015 and appreciate making my dev environment as fast as possible. its good to hear both deliver similar results actually@qdoubleits not really a race, its good to have options!. steveblue: I don't use require with webpack (it would actually crash AOT),  the angular2-template-loader plugin takes care of that. Haven't fully compared the dev speeds though. But yeah, both setups are capable. I've been forced to spend a lot of time with webpack, so it's more comfortable to me right now...but good to have comparable options, definitely. 

issue: qdouble: what is the comparison when you gzip the bundles? 
solution: steveblue: you could see if you could get my starter to work better with yours, was having some difficulty, it's not plug and play at all. 

issue: did you nuke your node_modules folder? 
solution: 

issue: Guys is it possible to have a base component that can inherits some properties/functions to other components? 
solution: MurhafSousli: though classes are classes, so you can still extend them as any other classes, but nothing provided by angular. I\'m making "special" buttons that has same functions but some has more inputs and functions than the others, so I was thinking of a way not to rewrite the common functions in every component. 

issue: is directives: [] deprecated ? 
solution: lazarljubenovic: so all goes toplevel ?. but if you onlt have AppModule which is mandatory, yes, it all goes there now. 

issue: where can I download angular 2.0 final?  On npm, they only have the beta version 
solution:

issue: how do i write the dependencies on Angular in package.json? This isn\'t giving me the newest version"@angular/compiler": "2.0.0", 
solution: 

issue: does RouterLink take relative or absolute path name? 
solution: just pointed out that depending on what you're trying to do, a simple service could also work. 

issue: http.get is an observable not getting observed? 
solution: this.http.get(this.quizUrl).map(this.extractData).catch(this.handleError);gets not executed?. Kaffiend: You can check the snapshot if you only want the current params. 

issue: I'm just trying to update my project to final version of angular I just have a problem with my custom forms validators, cause Control and ControlGroup doesn't exsit anymore 
solution:

solution: GoNode5: , that http even though maybe ugly used to work. 

issue: are we talking webpack or different config? 
solution: 

issue: anyone know how to add json files to the angular-cli build?

solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: peloncano: you could just declare them in separate .html files, and them load by templateUrl ?. Do someone know how to get rid of erros like:Untyped function calls may not accept type arguments? (it\'s coming from the d3 library that is "typed" with reference).

issue: Is it generally considered better to include your html in "templateUrl" or in "template" ?

issue: Hey everyone, i'm trying to find a way to save a form content into a local file (JSON or TXT), anyone have a hint ? 
solution: @baghdadisan This is pretty simple, but you won't do it with angular2 since it's on client side so you need some server side solution which could be anything. Just make it in a simple API call or such.Or are you talking about a file on the client pc? That's probably not possible because of lots of security reasons. You could however generate the file on a server side and preset it as a download or smth.. 

issue: How do I pass data to a Guard?I want to supply a list of roles to a HasRoleGuard 
solution: It seems a bit overkill, since I want to only supply the roles list in the routes config. leon: You don't without something funny. what I do is register all my routes on module contstruct and inject the service into the Guard to fetch the info. It's a pity it doesn't work the other way around I fiddled around a lot with options. So if you find something better let me know ;-).

solution: mithun-daa: upgrade from ng1. 

issue: Hello, lazyloading help needed here 
solution: For example: I have a FileManager component that needs inside its declarations an EntityUpload component. If EntityUpload component uses other components/directives, I would have to declare them inside FileManager declarations or Angular won't recognize them. How to avoid to explicitly declare them in the parent component?.

solution: 

issue: Hi, is there a callback when angular has rendered a component ? 
solution: use the event life cycle ngAfterViewInit, should do the trick. vouill: I did, but none seems to be the one I'm looking for.. ngDoCheck is called even though no rendering takes places (at least this is how I understand it).... 

issue: Is there anyone who can briefly explain to me how lazyloading in angular 2 works :)? 
solution: basvandenheuvel: in webpack for example, lazy loading will put that module into a separate js chunk which will not be loaded until you go to the route that loads that module... which on large applications will speed up initial load time. 

issue: Is there any angular 2 equivalent of $location.absUrl from angular 1, that gave the complete URL starting from https://? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: I had thought that I could pass that path to prepareExternalUrl, but that still doesn’t add the domain and http.. 

issue: Does anyone has an example for a pipe returning an observable? 
solution: rizwanhussain-vteams: it's not just it being impure, it's the fact that if you use offline compile or universal or etc. it will break. I don't fully remember all the flaws with it, but there's no reason to keep using that. 

issue: what is the best way to append and later remove elements from the DOM using a directive? 
solution: PerfectPixel: well what you described is either ngIf as Kozlovski said or the mentioned ngSwitch. I want to build a loading overlay, it's a directive that sits on the root element of an element and inserts a div-overlay if it receives an promise/observable. 

issue: shouldn't angular fail to compile template with unknown attribute? why did his code give no errors if he was missing a declaration? 
solution: i mean the angular parser doesn't let you have a div inside a ul and lets you have sg-no-padding as a form attribute without knowing what it is... someone please give me an excuse. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] please help me to solve this 
solution: erasad22: cygwin/babun or removermcommand from npm sript. well change the command from scripts to use whatever your OS uses.

issue: I’m trying to import the Location class into a component, but I’m being told it has no provider. I’m doing something similar to the example in the docs: [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] Is Location not part of the BrowserModule? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: That seems to work! I don’t see how I would have figured that out from the docs, though, with Location being part of@angular/common.. 

issue: hi,@All, Good Afternoon. How to get the json fields of the Response when http.get throws an error? I have the following code [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: so@Inputpasses in an object reference.. I thought it was a one way binding (ie child got it's own copy and could not affect parent) does not appear to be the case 
solution: so@DzmitryShylovichI don't really want to stop the stream, I just want to remove this value from the flow .. I think I might need a .reduce?.

issue: canngIf take an Observable<boolean> ?  `ngIf="isAuth | async"` ? 
solution: You can even have Observable arrays and check for the length of an Observable. ryanlangton: It's a workaround but if it saves the day, go for it if you are on a deadline.. If you are learning, then spend some more time understanding why it does not work.. 

issue: my target is to set variable as class name = : any 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: robert197: it would be better if we could pass the same arguments as in ngClass though. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Any ideas? 
solution: try adding this to your main entry file:. import 'core-js/es7/reflect';. 

issue: I have a property that contains html.. how do I display that in my template as html (right now it's showing the html tags on the screen which I don't want).. in angular1 you'd use $sce.trustAsHtml 
solution: lazarljubenovic: is there an equivalent of that to render other types of code? I have a project that's building the front end in angular on top of a Perl based mvc and it'd be useful to be able to render the perl include tags in my angular templates. 

issue: how do i redirect to a route with params? and  alex :)

solution: 

issue: language="JavaScript"?! just WHAT browsers are you targeting? netscape? 
solution: 

issue: hey@derekkitei see that you injected a store into your contact form. say for some reason you want two same contact forms side by side (with different data, and so a different store). is that possible? 
solution: scaryroy: Yes. This component, which I had working in an earlier beta and am porting to ngrx/store and effects, will have multiple contacts that are editable. My strategy is to have a selected contact state, and a list state and a controller state.. scaryroy: one store, but multiple states and reducers. I have a contact list with one state that includes the list and query. A primary contact state which is the selected one, with all the contact details. another state which is related contacts; my contact schema is related pieces such as addresses and people, so each of these has a list state. and when I click on one of them, a selected contact state is loaded with that contact and handles the editing. I have effects and services that read and write to a database and maintain a cache. The components get observables of the data, and dispatch actions to the store to get and set data.ngrx/example-app on github is a great example of a moderately complex app using ngrx/store and effects.. 

issue: isn't that how you register services? 
solution: 

issue: Any1 know how close they are to the next release? 
solution: alxhub: For the release that contains a fix for: [<-ISSUE->]. So it's a release that will be shipped with@angular/router ?. 

issue: whats the work of shim and polyfills ? 
solution: they are used to provide missing functionality across browsers. 

issue: I'm trying to use and understand angualr-cli but the AoT compiler ngc.  I created a new project with ng-cli and then tried to compile it with ngc and got a lot of errors.  The errors were on angular source itself  e.g.:Error at C:/Projects/Angular2/ng2-cli-test/node_modules/@angular/core/src/di/reflective_provider.d.ts:88:165: Cannot find name 'Map'.Error at C:/Projects/Angular2/ng2-cli-test/node_modules/@angular/core/src/facade/lang.d.ts:12:17: Cannot find name 'Map'.What gives? 
solution: 

issue: does angular2 support select withmultipleattribute? 
solution: fxck:  [<-LINK->]. and what do you pass it as current value. or something?. fxck: I don't use it myself. 

issue: how are you compiling your typescript? Because it's possible to configure it to compile despite typescript errors 
solution: greengalaxy2016: my understanding is that setting if true prevents the compiler from adding "use strict"  on all modules. It\'s not necessarily your issue. Can you show us some more context on the code? The only thing that would cause this would be casting the value to a number (which effectively defeats the compiler). 

issue: can anyone help me with a simple todo app? i have it in j fiddle 
solution: 

issue: is this possible in angular? [<-CODE->] 
solution: you have to define an include point inchildfor that. 

issue: If the return type changes, there's more places that end up being affectedand u think this is bad? 
solution: yeah actually it makes sense for you to see what else you need to update if you do a dramatic change like that. 

issue: Hi all! :) Have any of you already implemented a modal dialog with angular2? 
solution: i am not sure of the position of the modal, I mean the modal element should be just behind my <body> element@lazarljubenovic, or should I include my modal markup inside my component?. 

issue: no thank you] 
solution: 

issue: Hi everyone, do you know the best i18n library for Angular 2? 
solution: I mean, I want the users be able to change the language they want. 

issue: Hey guys, what is the best way of passing value from parent component to child component AFTER service finishes loading data remotely ? 
solution: Tempus35: usually it helps. And when it is template parse error it is easy to find it by looking into template. Paste stack trace and template..

issue: i've been following [<-LINK->] and it seems that my authguard won't work  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: his name is Matias 
solution: I guess you have some JavaScript in a<script>tag on your index.html which is initializing all of your jQuery plugins (like sliders, image galleries etc)?. If that's the case, that's probably going to expect the html to be present at the time of execution. In Angular, this isn't going to be the case. So you need to ensure that that code is executed whenever neccesary. (read as: when the component containing that particular functionality is added to the html). 

issue: Why is this simple component not responding to every mouse over event ? [<-LINK->] 
solution: I've absolutely no idea, I first thought it was because change detection was triggered on every instance of SubComponent, then I made some test and that is not the case. 

issue: how to use Jquery in angular2 applications, any articles or demo available? please share 
solution: 

issue: why are you installing angular globally ? 
solution: Felix, because otherwise I cannot install tslint globally and I cannot use tsserver as a service. I found that setup to be the only one working so far in order to have linting working properly. 

issue: I'm wondering@robwormald, not doing that would require to useimport 'gojs'and a global d.ts right ? 
solution: 

issue: varEnigmatic: You really shouldn’t be doing that. 
solution: varEnigmatic: Yeah -  I’m not even sure if thats possible because you need the angular libs locally when you run the typescript compiler to compile your project. You’re going to want to have everything locally anyways so you can use angular-cli / webpack to generate a build that includes ONLY the parts of the angular library that you’re using. You would miss out on a lot of benefits by just using a script tag. 

issue: catch all, you mean for cors ? 
solution: you should use path rewrite only if you actually need it. but it wasn't working without it, wasn't even getting 404s on the backend. 

issue: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/12030#issuecomment-250966716<div> and then browse to children with JQuery

issue: anyone using angular2-jwt in their project ? 
solution: 

issue: Jetbrains IDEA comes with Typescript 1.8.10, what if I want to use a different version without installing TSC globally? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: that seem to be different than that link . Is that going to work only with typescript versions installed globally ?. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] That's what you're doing. :) 
solution: 

issue: Is anyone using ng2-redux ? 
solution: 

issue: does it web worker friendly? 
solution: 

issue: Is the component set to ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush or is it nested under another component that is? what does the callback do? 
solution: so it does it's own internal (non-angular) http call, and then runs the callback you give it. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] I can copy/paste the output from the log into my element style in the debugger and it works there 
solution: lazarljubenovic: no that code does not work, thebackground-colorstyle works fine, thebackgroundstyle does nothing.

issue: Where do you import the jQuery?? I presume your tablesorter requires it?? and which assets is the one that is not working?? 
solution: rvdabhi: i dont see any issues there... but i presume your jQuery doesnt load or doesnt have a loader implemented. Are you sure you use the theme correctly??. 

issue: Hi I am trying to implement angular2-cookie in my angular app However the service has no methods listed when I include it in the constructor of the component 
solution: granjan: use localStorage.setItem('item', itemstr); and localStorage.getItem('item');. gibsonsyd: I can see the cookie in my response in debugger but unable to access it neither through headers nor through angular2-cookie package - where could I be going wrong. granjan: Don't know man. I'd stay away from cookies. Use localStorage instead..

issue: have you read the docs? done the tutorial? 
solution: robwormald: @frederikprijck.. I found the solution to my problem. I tried everything else, but the only thing that allowed my 3rd party library to load properly in BOTH browser (web) and also in Electron is to follow the advice given on this blog post (it's in Japanese, so you have to translate).. [<-LINK->]. Just wanted to let folks know here in case other questions arise...

solution: 

issue: matrix params are cool, but rarely used :P I like that they're there 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] any ideas how can I achieve this guys? 
solution: JuanDelgadillo: create a component with such template and reuse it. And if don't it could be an very helpful feature to add. 

issue: anyone know a good resource on query params other than the official docs? I've read those and am looking for another source that might help it click for me more 
solution: I have a date picker that allows a user to select a range of years/months independently of routing, and I need to somehow use the selected dates as parameters on the service to pull data from the server for that date range, and I'm trying to figure out if query params is the way I should go. 

issue: Hey, what's up? 
solution: 

issue: :-D 
solution: 

issue: Any solutions for my question? 
solution: 

issue: does anyone use this class for formatting their http parameters ?    URLSearchParams 
solution: yeah we're safe until angular 3. 

issue: How can I copy object but ditch his angular 2 reference? 
solution: sometimes I think people use different angular with different js. When I assign value of selected object to new object, if I change any value in new object it will show in old one.. 

issue: any simple tutorial to move on to Angular2? 
solution: 

issue: nobody here with webworkers/universal? 
solution: 

issue: bonnici: yes, I do this right now. But I want to move outupdatingprocess from children and keep it in one place(service or application) 
solution: 

issue: nottinhill: Well, on one side I'm inserting a 100 k components in  a for loop and it takes like 2 seconds to do so, thus I wanted to put a spinner. Also image processing. 
solution: I know what you gonna say, but I have 1 component per pixel. No kidding, but hear me out.  I decided to do a mock app to learn ng2, the idea was to do sort of like paint with  div being pixels ( actual size of the div varies). I had some fun with this mock app and I realize ng2 might not be suited for this now.  100k components is a bit extrem. 

issue: are you really forced to  use TypeScript for angular? 
solution: well, I can't get my project to run, because apparently param decorators are the only way.  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: dramalike teen wolf?

issue: it's compilation or runtime error? 
solution: 

issue: whats the diff between contructor injection and dependency injection? 
solution: dependency injectionpatterncontructor injectionimpl detail. the dependency injection guide could be more clear though i agree. 

issue: visual studio 2015 supported angular cli? 
solution: 

issue: dart version isthatfar behind? so they gave up on it? 
solution: It's not the same router, but it's close enough to lull you into a false sense of security.. 

issue: is it loaded? 
solution: 

issue: anyone know of a way to achieve that ? 
solution: ekarlso: i didn't test it or anything. just a quick writeup. georgefrick: just rerun an observable from get. georgefrick: yeah, and that will fire each time you change it ?. I mean each time you change something in the input. 

issue: has anyone here used angular2-modal? 
solution: jezguitarist30: yes. I really don't know what it's for. 

issue:  [<-ISSUE->] is this even a thing? I can't find anything aboutfragment 
solution: ericmartinezr: it's # in links. ericmartinezr:  [<-LINK->]. anyway, I don't think it would work. so. 

issue: parent->children->children? 
solution: Just I am having some weird behaviours here. I am not sure if I am doing it wrong or it's Angular router's limitation. 

issue: Q: Model driven forms. How do you get a subcontrol of a nested group? [<-CODE->] 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: Yeah like all NG2 things totally obvious. MarkPerryBV: before final they wrote comment for all public apis. 

issue: so this is all angular 2? or angular 1 
solution: it is confusing a little. i have a question as to using a dendency for a component.... like a bootstrap or jqeury. i can only do it from the root index.html file. 

issue: so are all components required to be declared in a module now ? 
solution: yupp. and if you want to use a component in another module, then you have to export the component first. 

issue: havent u used forms api? 
solution: if people can ask about cors here, you're probably closer to angular with that. at least it's front end question. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] 
solution: :). 

issue: born2net: great video! time to dive in to redux 
solution: 

issue: sample_twitter:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: ericmartinezr: My first reaction is that seems to defeat the simplification (of DOM, since Angular2 kind of conflates logical constructs and document elements) you'd accomplish through creation of sub-components . I envision messy components, but it does look like a valid answer to my question. 

issue: How do you get the route url ?? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: on scale java to js, how angry will you be if vic comes and says "we dont need this" and closes pr?. 

issue: Hi guys, a quick question: how to use global SCSS variables in angular2? I've created a shared 'vars.scss' file, but know I had to import in every single component to have it avaliable? I hope there's a better solution 
solution: Every angular2 component has a scss file which gets compiled to css and then used to generate the inline styles. I want to know if there\'s a better solution than write@import "_vars"in every single scss component file.. 

issue: Maybe just include a.d.tsfile that declares them? 
solution: Yeah. Doing that is kinda hacky, though.. this is worse [<-CODE->] why this could not make an http request nor printing anything in console?. 

issue: hello all.  Can you tell me if [<-LINK->] is still valid, for v2.1.0?  Looking to do an application-wide service for holding states. 
solution: yeah I’d like to think so, but you know..  guess the thing is that page references putting a services as providers in AppComponent, not AppModule.. 

issue: Sum of price*valu+quality  then order by asc ? 
solution: 

issue: what question may i provide you with? 
solution: 

issue: not sure if that is the solution I am looking for 
solution: Renniesb: just convert the map to array and iterate. this.http.get(" [<-LINK->] );. 

issue: Hi all, I have a strange problem. When I click a link to a new url some of the text is not rendered. 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: this is a custom component that has <input> inside of it, but it implements the interface for ControlValueAccessor so the FormGroup is outside of that component, you can see it here:. 

issue: whats the point in static fields in component classes? 
solution: 

issue: can I reference a static member of my component in my template? 
solution: JavaMonkey_twitter: you can do something much cleaner than usingconstructor.prop [<-ISSUE->] see his workaround. 

issue: npm install -gpackage-name 
solution: it is mandatory to install git?for this very project?. actually i installed git bash. 

issue: Hello guys! For some reason I have this error "No provider for ChangeDetectorRef" I googled for 2 hours no result do you have any ideas? PLEASE :'( just a minute. will do 
solution: The main idea is that I have two popups. P1 and P2. The first one has a condition and if it works - it should jump to P2 instantly. It calls modalService.open(...). The code works, service gets new data. But the view is not updated after that. 

issue: it doesnt exist anymore use ComponentFactoryResolver 
solution: robwormald: I want to check with you an idea I've just wrote to stagger animatons with observables.... this will be a lot easier when query support lands for animations. 

issue: Why does this happen?  [<-LINK->] It rerenders the checkboxes? 
solution: 

issue: why do u watch ng conf talks? 
solution: 

issue: You can add a:customerIdparameter to all your routes maybe? 
solution: alxhub: Tried this but it does not work !!!. 

issue: I am not sure what this means, any ideas? [<-CODE->] This is the class extending it, the base class has the exact same constructor except without the super call [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: hey guys, is there a room fro angular2? 
solution: stink3finger_twitter: this is the room for angular2. I am a newby in angular2 and need help to get a module imported into my project.. this is the module I need to use:. but then, to attach something which is an angular component, I should use eventemmiter, right?. 

issue: any is any sometimes u just don't care about the type 
solution: well Rob, your talks are literally the only ones I don't have to speed up when watching. thanks for speaking fast and not dragging on just to fill up your time slot. 

issue: can we export interfaces ? from module 
solution: thbt: you can use an interface as parameters, but not for dependency injection. 

issue: when it finishes what? 
solution: 

issue: And the question is... :) 
solution: well duhObject.create(null)is always gonna be faster. DzmitryShylovich: you see that collaborative benchmark app would really be handy :). 

issue: anyone know how to escape the semi-colon here?<a routerLink="home(right:account)">Click</a>.@angular/router seems to be transforming that to%3A 
solution: only other thing I can think of would be setting a var for that string with the colon and then putting in template like routerLink="{{mylinkwithcolon}}". 

issue: how can i set therouterLinkActivedirective upper than the parent tag? I wanna set it ona.nav-linkbut apparently it doesnt work there [<-CODE->] 
solution: it only works if i put routerLinkActive="active" to the direct ancestor of routerLink directive.so what do u want from us? :). 

issue: I need to place components somewhere in the DOM, how many and where can only be determined at runtime. It appears to me that@angular/core/ComponentFactory is the right class, but I don't know how to use it 
solution: 

issue: i put a breakpoint in chrome devtools inside of a component' constructor function and refresh. It doesnt stop the execution there. It also doesnt work inside ngOnInit [<-CODE->] 
solution: also it also works wit ha breakpoint in chrome devtools if:1, u set breakpoint2, change smth in source3, lets webpack reload sitethen it stops. 

issue: I have a method that returns a collection, but requiresthis. I'm trying to render angforfor this collection, which seems  to be impossible. How is that usually done? 
solution: 

issue: Validators.requiredis not working for file inputs? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: If I want to combine route.params with route.url .... 

issue: Is there a way to  get RequestHeaders in the angular 2 http.map() ?? 
solution: alex-barberi: Response headers not Request headers. 

issue: Is this how you set params in root segment?<a [routerLink]="[\'\']" [queryParams]="{ scrollTo: \'#contact\' }">contact</a> 
solution: alex-barberi: , if you are reffering to this example,<a [routerLink]="[\'/crisis-center\', { foo: \'foo\' }]">Crisis Center</a>it wont work for root segment. 

issue: istiti: lol, then don't use safe navigation operator, no? 
solution: 

issue: why are you using this way?

solution: Just a bit more, yeah.. Or live in Erlich's incubator Kappa. Well I know a guys which move from here (Venezuela) to Sillicon Valley to begin his startup, and he isn't back so I believe he's doing decent atleast. 

issue: ngModel should be bound to an object not a function unless it's bound to a getter and setter function i guess 
solution: Trying something I found via google.  Putting in hidden input fields that are bound to the underlying values (since the dropdown is bound to a getter that combines two values to form a range).. 

issue: pressing  edits the last message 
solution: lazarljubenovic: that's f'in sweet!. on linux you have to ctrl-alt though.

solution: 

issue: how do you all import 3rd party libraries from your node_modules that aren't using module loading? [<-CODE->] this gives me an error that jquery.bootstrap.wizard.js cannot be found, but I can see the file 
solution: maxime1992: When you navigate, the tree of routes is rebuilt as necessary, so your references might not refer to anything anymore (for example, if route doesn'thaveany children). If you're only setting up the subscription once, it won't be attached to anything after that.. 

issue: I am trying to work this example [ [<-LINK->] ] out in my application which has a similar line of pages. I can go from my login page which loads in the app component to the ReportList  page which loads in the report component. However, I get this error: Uncaught (in promise): Template parse errors:Can\'t bind to \'value\' since it isn\'t a known property of \'md-progress-bar\'.If \'md-progress-bar\' is an Angular component and it has \'value\' input, then verify that it is part of this module.\nIf \'md-progress-bar\' is a Web Component then add "CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA" to the \'@NgModule.schema\' of this component to suppress this message.

issue: Yay, dialogs in the correct position ^_^ 
solution: 

issue: love how it has subtitles 
solution: lazarljubenovic:  [<-LINK->]. DzmitryShylovich: i hate it that that song is not bad at all. 

issue: Hmmm... does anybody have any idea why this doesn't emit anything when navigation happens?: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: anybody else had performance problems with TestBed ? 
solution: alxhub: depending on which modules get passed into theTextBed.configureTestingModuleimports, it's takingseconds. not super big yet. The parent module for component was importing our 'shared' module, which also imports most of angular/material2... which could be the culprit. but it seems like module dependencies for component libraries (we have our own as well) will pile up, and that thing will slow down, esp. if it's in abeforeEach(which I thought was the norm.). 

issue:  [<-CODE->] apparently my stuff is not done for some reason, i assume im messing smth up again :P [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: Cannot find type definition file for 'es6' i thought it was available by default in"types"? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: you know the answer right, but you want me to start using my head because the answer is probably in front of me. 

issue: Is it possible to reorder components projected throughng-content?  Ive been searching for information with no luck I'm leaning towards this not being possible. I can't figure out what the view container would be for something like that 
solution: I was thinking I could get a handle on theComponentRefinstances of the components in theng-contenttag and then use theViewContainerRefto reorder them. Sadly, I could not tell theContentChildrento read those Component. 

issue: in the image, the error function is reduce,  any help please

issue: Hey@alxhubI don\'t suppose you could help me with my "Expression has changed after it was checked" problem? :D 
solution: alxhub: from callbacks in a 3rd party focus trap library (but I've surrounded them with NgZone, thinking that would solve the problem, but apparently not!). 

issue: what is the best way to add an authentication token to http app wide? A service that wraps the calls?

issue:  [<-CODE->] 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: ''.split('') returns []. it was guard against undefined.split('') but that never happens. looks like async pipe stops the "pipe queue". 

issue: HelloCan someone help me with the 404 /traceur error in Angular2? 
solution: poluripradeep: I also am fairly new to angular2 development (4 months of experience). I also started by following the Tour of Heroes tutorial and hit similar issues to you.@DzmitryShylovichthen advised me to move towebpackinstead and I did. I now useangular-cliwhich has been recently changed to usewebpackas well. Things are working much more smoothly for me now.I would suggest that you also move to using [<-LINK->].

issue: oh my 
solution: 

issue: does anybody know to send a message from browser/client to the server? :( 
solution: lazarljubenovic: looks like angular2 docs :P. every thing I click from SO questions is 404's. 

issue: So AOT dosen't work with lazy loading right now aye? 
solution: Toxicable: it does, but its kind of flaky, i'm actually fixing the resolution bug at the moment. I think ill hold off on it for now. 

issue: what is #d refering to? 
solution: It will be any. 

issue: can you run it through tsc? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] how is this correct? 
solution: you should declare the type of the error case from catch (if its different than the success case). and then handle it as a union type. 

issue: rgreen-code: Could you please set up a demo here: [<-LINK->] 
solution: ahahahah. 

issue: Hi can anyone help me on when we need to import platform-browser and when to use platform-browser-dynamic? 
solution: cwj92: you use platform-browser when you're in AoT mode. 

issue: as in migrate to a most recent version? 
solution: lazarljubenovic: just put in a new issue in jade's repo, can't stop the train. 

issue: Hi everyone!!! I do this :  [<-CODE->] but in the  || crash what is the operator or? 
solution: and I think something like ngClass="{paddingzero: methodThatChecksWhatever()}" would be nicer. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] does anyone know what's wrong with npm? 
solution: instead of typescript. it simply doesn't find the command and then looks in ubuntu's official package manager. 

issue: I have a question for y'all about services. Do you tend to split your services out per data object? For example - if I have a component that will need to interact with a certain set of objects, should I create a separate service for each object, or just bundle them all into the same service? 
solution: So on a user profile page, if you also had information around the groups that user was a member of, or let's say awards they may have earned, and those came from different tables in the DB, but are still going to be displayed in the same component, do you think you'd break 'em out into their own services, or just use them within the UserService?. 

issue: what error are you getting@e-oz? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: then my click handler dies, i guess because it is not bindable :P anyways it doesnt solve it [<-CODE->]. 

issue: Hello Someone can help me ? [<-LINK->]

solution: 

issue: im actually using a behaviour subject so turns i can do this: [<-CODE->] oh is it not? 
solution: unless you're referring to List itself? in which case its from [<-LINK->]. 

issue: How do you guys work with Set on Typescript? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] what would be the best was to detect this? 
solution: tsm91: setter. so i do input as a setter and toss this line as a side effect?how can i ensure the view has been already updated? is it sync?. ngOnChanges runs after change detection. 

issue: why is the time pipe adding 5 hours to the times being displayed ? I mean date pipe 
solution: I have a date input- <input type="datetime-local" name="usr_time" style="height: 22px;" #time>. later on another page it displays the date you input.

issue: @alxhubany help with dynamically loading components? 
solution: alxhub: I have a html which I get through a webservice response and it is rendered in my application, Is there a way where I can load a component dynamically into it?. 

issue: just wondering if TypeScript would build to asm.js some day... 
solution: Toxicable: it’s not that “I want it”, right? But it just seems to be the next level of performance optimisation…  I doubt we will move further to ES2015 built-in in browsers as a major specification. It seems we are stuck on ES5.5. (that is: if I got what asm.js really is). 

issue: Has anyone been able to work with TypeScript paths in webpack2 TsConfigPathsPlugin doesn't seem to do it 
solution: thelgevold: are you using a seed or angular-cli?. alright well i haven't tried this for that seed, but i was using thealiasproperty in your webpack config. 

issue: reactiveforms module or not? 
solution: 

issue: Hi. Any suggestions for a good tree and tree table component in ng2? 
solution: Supports aSync trees also :). RicardoVaranda: I've been looking at that one but the fact that the demo crashes doesn't give confidence [<-LINK->]. 

issue: can you create services in angular with php? component like 
solution: And I honestly ask why you would want to.. So, big picture: You write a dynamic front end with Angular 2. Then you write a backend to server data through a standard exchange(REST or Graphql). The Services get your data from the API and inform the Components as to what they are supposed to do.. 

issue: Have you got this markup in your app template? <router-outlet></router-outlet> 
solution: that means your main template is missing<router-outlet></router-outlet>… that can be it’s missing in your app template or, if you have a child route, it would be missing in the parent route template. 

issue: Can anyone please answer this question on StackOverflow [<-LINK->] 
solution: MasterComponent explicitly owns ChildComponent, there\'s no "low coupling" problem, ChildComponent can have a method like "showDataForMyDropdownValueWhatever(value...)" and that;s it. 

issue: Can someone confirm that this is true: apply the take(1) operator to a "live" firebase observable unsubscribes after subscription. 
solution: 

issue: Would anyone know, is there a news group forum that is used heavily for Angular? 
solution: 

issue: I'd emit an event and use a service to handle it@crain 
solution: crain: I see they only have sortChanged as the only output event, you were interested when the arrayItems changed also right?. 

issue: hey guys. Is it possible to reference jquery as $ from a project using angular-cli? I asked in the angular-cli room, but didn't get an answer 
solution: @thelgevold Seems like the problem I'm running into is with angular-cli and jquery and signalr all not playing well with each other.I ended up having to do: [<-CODE->] in order for it to work, 'cause ms-signalr-client wants window.jQuery to exist. 

issue: I would like to be notified on the form 'fieldname':'value' How can I make the values of form an observable using RxJS? 
solution: At a guessObservable.of(form.value). but I think there is a Observable already there for it just cant remeber the name of the field. 

issue: How do you bypass the sanitization? 
solution: probably not applicable at all... but as a wise ex coworker told me once... "...just because you can make sex with prostitute, doesnt mean you should...". 

issue: I don't know if is the right place to ask.. Someone have experience with angular cli and electron? 
solution: i don't think angular is ready for electron. or maybe i'm compleely wrong and that repo is irrelevant. yeah,, I know that people got it worked togther..just need to ask how they build it. 

issue: I'm an angular newbie and I'm fighting some routing config for a few days 
solution: entity/:id/notes,  entity/:id/notes/:id, other_entity/:id/notes, other_entity/:id/notes/:id. and just "apply" it to different other entities. 

issue: trackBy is a function 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: , I use it as then, some example?. I have a list of input, Where the user modifies the Amounts, and each input Have the event (keyup) = "get Mono Input.emit (nameSol.value)" Which Changes the value of my reductor.ts.. 

issue: I have a template that contains and anchor element like this: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: Mufasa: afaik disabled is not valid for anchor elements. So is there a consistent way to handle both<button>and<a>elements when you need to dynamically disable them?. 

issue: resolve is the only way to delay rendering 
solution: ifiokidiang_twitter:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Who doesnt love latex, right ? 
solution: Latex≠evil \\mathrm{Latex} \\ne \\sqrt{\\mathrm{evil}} Latex≠√evil. 

issue: is AOT will continue and be a separate command or will it be merged into angular-cli? IMO, would think cli should do it all.. no? 
solution: It will always be a seprate command since you might not always want to use it. I would think cli should be able to run aot, and  would be easier to just npm install one thing... IMO. 

issue: ZoneJS just says:No provider for ApplicationRef... watdo? especially since I'm not referencing ApplicationRef anywhere 
solution: 

issue: weizlini: you get what you needed? 
solution: 

issue: did u inject it? 
solution: 

issue: when a component is imported via module... is it possible to extend a component from that module, outside of it... or would that typically be done from within the module? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: i was trying to inherit/extend (but i wasn\'t overriding any functions or anything) the class from a component in this module... but i kept getting: "is not a known element" by doing that.

issue: escaring is a legend, and a legend never dies 
solution: Today we're launching an updated look for Gitter.and still there's no mute. fuck it. 

issue: Good morning dear friends :) 
solution: alxhub:. except new white theme. 

issue: you can just join the two observables together Observable.combineLatest(a$, b$, (a, b) => { ... }) 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] ? 
solution: probably is. I'd say I'd probably server side render markdown personally. ronnyek: I could bind to innerHTML or no?. 

issue: were there any discussions in the early stages of ng2 development about putting separate modules in separate git repo's? if so, any major deciding factors? 
solution: With one repo, if a change breaks CI we know about it immediately and not at some future integration point.. 

issue: can youwhat now? 
solution: 

issue: anyone have any luck two way binding on innerHtml for a div? 
solution: You can only two-way bind properties that are designed for it, likengModel.. [(foo)]="bar"is syntactic sugar for[foo]="bar" (fooChange)="bar = $event". Since there is noinnerHTMLChangeevent, two way binding syntax won't work with it.. 

issue: Good morning all! 
solution: alxhub: it\'s a new "pattern" [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Hey. Guys, does everyone recommend to start with official Angular 2 Quickstart? 
solution: msegers: ? Tour of heroes? Did you dive into webpack setup/usage with angular2-webpack-starter or did you use provided out of the box features?. 

issue: I've been listening to a french black metal band for 4 hours now, I'm ok with this. 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: I know I need to register it in the providers sections,. amitdahan: ot has a different selector. 

issue: hello, as control with immutable objects, the FormArray? because it has methods like push to add elements to the array  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: whats the point of the CanActivateChild guard? Wouldn't I get the same effect by using a CanActivate guard for a child route? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: my problem was that I somehow thought that the guard was meant to be used on each child-route (children array) but it is actually meant for the parent-route. 

issue: what is template? why not just use ng-content? (I've never used that template stuff so I'm not sure, sorry) 
solution: 

issue: What's the difference between the ActivatedRoute and the ActivatedRouteSnapshot?? 
solution: cquillen2003: as far as i understand, ActivatedRouteSnapshot is asynchronousobject that contains data about your current route as plain values. ActivatedRoute is asynchronous and provides you with observables to the values. cquillen2003: ActivatedRoute is injectable everywhere and holds asnapshotproperty which holds the currently (synchronous) activated route. ActivatedRouteSnapshot is the type of said snapshot, pretty sure you can't inject it, it's just a type.. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] 
solution: tsm91: you MUST subscribe to an observable to make it works. 

issue: Anyone know how to "ng new" a project into the current directory? 
solution: No, sincecanActivateis deciding whether or not the component can actually be instantiated, there is no instance yet.. 

issue: can you use a directive to get the ViewContainer an *ngFor directive has injected into it? 
solution: i want to programmatically add/remove some placeholder in my list of objects generated by anngFordirective. a whole newlithats different than the rest. 

issue: is it possible to  add extra obj in JSON using JS? myJSON = {   "extraNewObj": "value",  "properties" : {}  } so the extraNewObj is always at the very top 
solution: 

issue: where is your app being served from? a view or an index.html? 
solution: in the home index chtml. 

issue: FUT: service with observables. Read Victor Savkin's blog, he has a way of doing it that is quite elegant. 
solution: jjstreet: I have a mixture of smart/dumb components where the dumb ones are essentially extensions of the forms created by their parent, and the parent dispatches. I don't like emitting events through more than two components. Confuses my feeble mind.. 

issue: Does anyone know how to make a directive global to the whole application? 
solution: alxhub: I have a directive that makes an input only take certain characters and I want to be able to use it throughout the application, aka different modules. alxhub: it works if i declare it in one but if i try to move it up the chain it stops working, i get no errors. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] But this seems "bad" to me... 
solution: msegers: well the issue is that I want to be able to pull in some configuration page that is controlled by a traditional CMS, i.e. rendered on the page somewhere or othewise provided by the CMS. 

issue: can I use a(click)="myFunction()"event on an option tag? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: does it run locally withng serve? 
solution: That should cause it to error closer to the actual problem (CoreModuleis doing something improper?). 

issue: there are no Http modules there? Actually, you needRouterModule.forRoot() 
solution: all I am trying to do is create a dang hyperlink to a rout, I need 3 modules to do that?. 

issue: Hey, looking for some info on " error in view x caused by no provider for X " 
solution: DaveDillon: you have a service that you haven't provided. derekkite: I've added the service to providers in the component however its still not working in some instances. Has had me stumped for a bit.. DaveDillon:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: hmm, anyone has idea how to use ENV variables with angular-cli ? 
solution: one more thing any idea why my timeLeft is not updated without dummy setInterval(() => {}); on that component [<-LINK->] ?. signalr is run outside angular zone. 

issue: can you read me? 
solution: 

issue: Imightdo a talk about it during ng-be 
solution: I agree that this isbadthat we don't have good docs on the whole view model. I spent few hours picking up bits and pieces. 

issue: how much does a text editor have to do to become an IDE then? 
solution: andreasadk: you're so far off it's painful :X. Maybe for web development, but it has a reason intellij is more expensive than web storm. If you're full stack, you really want intellij's awesome DB integration for example.. 

issue: hello.. so how do i doValidator.pattern()for123-123-1234 
solution: 

issue: pkozlowski-opensource: isn't it enough to just remove [<-LINK->] check? why do we need an additional identifier? 
solution: just removing check from template parser is not enough as code gen wasn't ready to handle many interpolations. 

issue: active = !active ? or not? it's like super hot here, I can't think clearly 
solution: I haven't seen the sun since a week. 

issue: ANyone know how to remove the "Method can be made static" in webstorm? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] that you mean? 
solution: If you trust a value that might be malicious, you are introducing a security vulnerability into your application.. they should have psalms instead of chapters so we can quote "The Book of Sanitization, psalm 16:64". 

issue: does anyone have problems cli picking up changes made through webstorm 2016.2.4?@DzmitryShylovich? 
solution: it sees the change, rebuilds the bundle, the browsers sees it but says "nothing changed". 

issue: morning 
solution: HOw's everyones day been?. Toxicable: almost half way done. Good day.. 

issue: isn't angular supposed to complain if you try to bind to a nonexistent output or input? 
solution: 

issue: PEsteves8: this is sth we need to fix on ng-bootstrap side - see [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: the only tricky part is that is kind of low-level DOM manipulation and we don't want to break server-side rendering with Universal. 

issue: what about the design docs? 
solution: prob not enough. born2net: for example this one [<-LINK->] I don't think this is up to date, but there are design docs that can be helpful for now. 

issue: How would I send a message from a directive to a separate component I want that directive to use? 
solution: and inject that service into the directive and component you want pass messages between. you could setup an observable in the service so that everytime you told that observablenext()your component could subscribe to the observable and get item. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] you don't need css 
solution: 

issue: what is the best template or templateUrl in angular 2? 
solution: tanggrapes: I prefer templateUrl so that my HTMLish code is separate from my TypeScript.  But others prefer seeing it all in one place.  Just be consistent.. derekkite: if you use angular-cli (or webpack with angular-loader) then templateUrl is inlined. If you use another build process then it might be fetched during run-time via XHR. 

issue: Was someone able to use visual studio debugger with chrome and a project built with angular cli? 
solution: 

issue: what is the right way for hanling errors in angular? 
solution: lihaibh: I personally have 3 days for handling errorsmy first one is a general purpose one alert component, this is subscribed to a part of my state tree that contains any of 4 different types of errors (succes, info, warn, error) then displays tthem in the top leftThe other 2 are specific to forms.a validation component that takes in a form-control as input then displays errors absed oon thatThe last on is a summary component that will display a list of errors, this is intended for errors comming the server like "that name is already taken". 

issue: aaah.  I played diablo 1&2 and then 3 for... a week 
solution: but yeah, they're putting in the full first game, even retro graphics mode. 

issue: and what does yarn do better than npm? 
solution: it installs shit in <10s and not >1m. 

issue: what's up at blizzcon ? 
solution: and koreans are not humans :). and a new class - necromancer. 

issue: all your error messages inherit from "Error" native interface? 
solution: Atm they're just each strings, I havn't had the need to include metadata in them yet. Since they're formatted on the server already. 

issue: can i inject different service at runtime based on what user chooses in the dropdown? basically a live strategy pattern 
solution: 

issue: i@nponiroszone error. is setTimeout something within or without angular? 
solution: that hints that something is happening outside of the angular zone. Hence the question. setTimeout sets up a callback, Is it within the angular zone?. 

issue: so we won't be subscribing anymore just awaiting mmmm not exactly 
solution: more that, yeah. because obs.forEach() returns a promise. 

issue:  g'morning people you and me really have no life, huh 
solution: who needs formal education when you have angular docs!. 

issue: Ok, so you\'re saying that you can only await on a single async result not a stream which is why "proposed" await and observables won\'t work together? 
solution: Fair enough.  For some reason I though you could await on a method that returned multiple results but now that I think about it the returned task has only one result method that can be called which is what happens in the await.  So I'm remembering now. 

issue: anyone could tell me how to upgrade to latest version from angular2.0.0 by angular-cli, please? 
solution: daslicht: either install the Version that angular wants or live with the error (I use rxjs rc.1 and everything works and I also see the error you see). 

issue: I'm setting up an api and was wondering how to handle the response, if I have this: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Like so: [<-CODE->] ? 
solution: So really it's my own interface for a certain data type rather thanResponseye?. 

issue: How do I call a parent component method from within transcluded/projected contents? 
solution: a shot in the dark but maybe<some-cmp #parent><span *ngIf="parent.mathodOnSomeCmp()"></span></some-cmp>. definitely not possible the way you're asking, that would look formethodOnSomeComponent()in the host component (that the template belongs to). 

issue: How do I make the template update when underlying data has changed (but not a new instance)? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: I still can't figure it out. If I have a complex object and I have a deeply nested value change, how can I force change detection to detect it?i.e. if I have something like data.node.child.name = 'New Name', how do I get the 'New Name' to show up in the browser instead of the old one?. alxhub: I don\'t and it doesn\'t. The example I gave was a simplification. Actually what changes I\'m trying to force are boolean "switches" that are used in retrieval functions that are passed to and affect locally stored variables of the component. Meaning, the original data is not present.I basically have in myngOnInit() { this.localData = this.data.getData()}. 

issue: Hey guys once again!Has anyone used a datepicker with ng2 yet? What would be the one to be recommended for now? 
solution:  [<-LINK->] This is the worst documented github repo I have ever seen so far. so I got kinda confused and decided to ask before I spend another 3 hours trying to figure out some alpha version datepicker. 

issue: Where do you validate your form data with ngrx? 
solution: rrubio: Hehe it was actually a question of my own. 

issue: Why is it undefined [<-CODE->] 
solution: basherr: ViewChildren are only available in/after ngAfterViewInit, not in ngOnInit. stephanjust: any way around to trigger on change event forselectafterviewinit. basherr: Never tried that. Change is not a function though, so maybe it's an EventEmitter that you can emit? No clue. 

issue: have you compared it to the quickstart or tour of heroes projects? 
solution: ill have a look at this one: [<-LINK->]. i might have to useRenderer.animate()instead of@HostBindingfor switching totransformfromtopandleft. 

issue: is the topic of ngUpgrade better suited for this channel or the ng2 channel? 
solution: I have an app which uses JIT and I'm thinking about switching to AOT, but I guess I will have many errors. 

issue: how may I attest that an object is a component? they are built with metadata so instanceof won't do it. 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: I guess the fundamental problem is to have a sane way to import all of my components into my NgModule. I have a TS module that exports all of my components, as well as associated objects, but I can\'t just insert them into the NgModule declarations metadata because it throws. "(SystemJS) Could not compile \'InputType\' because it is not a component." etc.. 

issue: god dammit javascript :/ [<-CODE->]  [<-LINK->] Looks like parseInt is way more reliable than the + operator :( 
solution: dancancro:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Hi@robwormald, I want to ask, would the team make*ngWith? 
solution: It would be very helpful if we can declare a variable in the template, specially when usingOnPush [<-CODE->]. 

issue: can you pass variables between a parent and child component thats been loaded with router-outlet using@Input/@output? 
solution: Though I believe the child can still inject the parent if it chooses.. So I guess you cant have nested component-less routes. 

issue: I wonder why it doesn’t implement http?  That way http could be replaced…haha nevermind.  circular problem there 
solution: that's a rough impl@MurhafSousliso don't just copy pasta it. that would be pretty reasonable,  a quick fix for trivial situations. 

issue: survey: 3 most common questions asked in here? 
solution: 3: probably AOT, not so much in the last few days but it's deffinately been talked of a bit. 

issue: hi, is there any best sample of angular 2 in Visual studio 2015? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->]

solution: 

issue: Hi all, is there a way to pass parameters with angular 2 http.delete method? 
solution: http.delete(url, params). chrillewoodz: but here the "params" will be headers for the request. 

issue: Angular 3 coming by march 2017 I hope there are no breaking changes for those deploying Angular 2 
solution: quoting the article"Wormald said he was not aware of any features that would be deprecated in Angular 3, but when features are to be deprecated, the Angular team will let developers know ahead of time and keep supporting that feature for two major release cycles.". 

issue: Hi, I have an error when I set dynamically a validation [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: Is it possible to have a custom error handler for just the module where it is provided? 
solution: 

issue: is it possible to inject router into a service? why is that would you let me know how? 
solution: 

issue: How to overcome this? [<-CODE->] 
solution: jordic: there are some services which injects each other and circular dependency injection error occurs... 

issue: robwormald: Great video. 
solution: 

issue: I need  help to tranpose rc4 angular 2 project to angular 2 project 
solution: neuberfran: The big change is ngModules. Routes. Forms. Start with the modules, not that hard, in fact simplifies the layout of a complex app. Then rewrite your routes. Again, not complicated. Then forms which are different in subtle ways and will drive you nuts if you have complex forms. 

issue: So I think it can be considered as a map ? 
solution: yeah of course but on top of that I use typedRecord. hmm I've not used typedRecord instead I just used [<-LINK->] sorrry no clue... basherr: I made a small test by pushing an array in my immutable var, then modify the array by ref and of course it was changed into the immutable so it was wrong. I now use List.of() ;) !. 

issue: can anyone tell me how can I use a component globally? 
solution: 

issue: dart is not very popular here :) 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: whats the difference between HostListener/HostBinding,@Input/@Output, and using@ViewChild? 
solution: usually in javascript, if you write a function or method that accepts a variable, you dont NEED to pass it a variable. Idk why the service is complaining. 

issue: its material styled how is that polymer lol 
solution: I know that; its not the styling that we’re talking about. so its polymer as long as its based on material design at all?. 

issue: Who knows about angular 3  what's the hell ? 
solution: dotnetforever_twitter: tldr: 6 month release schedule. breaking changes come with deprecation warnings. yes, we'll still bump every 6 months. we have plenty of changes we want to make. The major version indicates that an API has officially been changed, but as stated in the policy, we will continue to support API as deprecated until its removed. 

issue: and does your code have any dependencies? jQuery or something? 
solution: well then no. you CAN use jQuery in angular 2 but its highly advised against. tmamedbekov: You should refactor your code into angular, youre going to have to rethink the design patterns. 

issue: how to build a global search in ng2? 
solution: Toxicable: I am using a table in my app and I want to search  the table content based on all the fields... AyzPat: then try match on all fields. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] won't work I suppose :). 
solution: Well, actually, it gives me an error since apparently Angular then expects you to implement the ControlValueAccessor interface.... But I don't want to, I just want to use the control instead. I guess I'll just have to create my own input, but didn't really want to address this component differently than other inputs.. 

issue: Is there some older computer-sciency / design pattern name for the redux architecture? 
solution: Event Sourcing is the most commonly compared thing. Someone always has been doing it for 20-60 years it seems. 

issue: Hi! Trying to include my custom code in the component? Any easy way? 
solution: that depends on so many things, what does your code do. 

issue: DzmitryShylovich: isn't that PR the same as [<-ISSUE->] ? Although that seems to be stale 
solution: 

issue: … are you including the scripts? its not bootstrapping the app 
solution: 

issue: is this a proprietary code base? 
solution: if there is a specifc piece you are curious about I can share it. does usersettingservice take a dependency on authservice?. 

issue: does anyone know why the lifecycle hooks are abstract classes instead of interfaces? 
solution: lazarljubenovic: yes, you even use those with implements but I don't get why the devs thought that an abstract class is better than an interface. I find that confusing... in the end, you don't have to writeimplementsat all, it will call function namedngOnInitanyway (it's recommended you do though). 

issue: does anybody use octotree extension? 
solution: it was perfectly fine a week ago :(. 

issue: how do u use it? 
solution: 

issue: is there a consensus seed project for ang2+webpack+express? 
solution: photostu: you will probably need two seeds, one for express and one for ng2. I don't know any seed providing both but most ng2 seeds should also have a webserver which might be good enough for you. 

issue: error what does mean app.component has no exported member? 
solution: like this. 

issue: in http? 
solution: 

issue: does it happen with minimal hello world app with same setup? 
solution: there's also a minimal branch. can't reproduce that :). 

issue: how will ts see them tho if it's not from@typesnow? do you have to /// ref 
solution: yeah, you can still just download the typings manually and put it in your project. 

issue: how to use LESS CSS in angular 2? 
solution: bchiremath: you compile it and use css files?. you can st up your build process that way. btw cli supports sass, prolly supports less too. 

issue: Anyone have issues calling a Rails API backend for data? Converting it and using it in an A2 app? [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] this fails with a cyclic dependency issues but I don't see why that would happen. 
solution: 

issue: *ngFor="let x of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]" you could create your own directive too 
solution: *ngFor="let x of values"values = new Array(20000). 

issue: Can ValidatorFn return an observable ?? 
solution: xban1x: if you use it as an async validator then yes. I have tried returning an observable but to no result.... 

issue: What's the Alternative for angular.element in angular 2? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: .... I am facing a problem where... A parent div consists of 2 children - input, label!!what i have to do is.... For all these type of elements... The content in the label has to be appended inside the input(beginning). So am trying to calculate the width of label and give padding -left : new width for the input. 

issue: I just upgraded from 2.1.0 to 2.2.0 and am getting  ApplicationRef instance not found 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] whats wrong with@Component?please 
solution: neuberfran: you can use Decorators like Component only on classes. neuberfran: but youre using on a variable (routes). 

issue: I still don't get it how to do this: [<-CODE->] in code. Any hints please? 
solution: Injectors are immutable, you can't add providers.. 

issue: How to control ng-valid state of custom value accessor ?? 
solution: 

issue: do you have a customProperty on a template, that is not present on the class? classcomponent? 
solution: AbinayaSubbiah: Have you tried to delete node_modules and install again?. AbinayaSubbiah: if you want more feedback, you need to show us your component, with the customProperty. 

issue: is aot available in the cli yet? 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys! Quick question: What would be the best way to add a component to the DOM dynamically? 
solution: bergben: dude. you should watch a video by@robwormaldhe just posted last week, it goes through some options on inserting dynamic components and templates. 

issue: Hi, has anyone used an Angular 2 plnkr in IE11? 
solution: Hmmm.. that's unfortunate.  Was trying to replicate and isolate and IE11-specific problem I was going to post on SO.. 

issue: WebWorkers are only usable for services then?? 
solution: xban1x: , no, you can run a whole Angular app in one.. alxhub: I meant for normal development of an App. I know i can run whole app in it :). alxhub: services should not directly update DOM. But they can run tedious tasks which dont need to be run in the main thread.... 

issue: Hi. Is anybody familiar with angular’sDirectiveNormalizerclass? 
solution: alxhub: I’ve got a problem.No template specified for componenterror is thrown anytime, an inline template is used in@Componentdecorator. When I usetemplateUrlin@Component, everything works as expected (async load of html files). 

issue: Angular 2 doesn't seems very promising, I'm disappointed :( Should I switch to react ? 
solution: 

issue: what are you trying to do ? have multiple rows affecting a total ? i dont know why you have the name field there ? 
solution: that would be how to use a service to update an observed value. and how a component can subscribe to those updates and do something. 

issue: What I'm doing is creating a validation for date max and min for that textfield. 
solution: Ranguro: , in@angular/forms, validators are only supposed to take as input the control they operate on.. I have a date textfield. It cant exceed a date (not related to any other field) and it can't be minimum that another date (not related to any field).. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] this is my implimentation of a storage wrapper 
solution: as long as you JSON.stringify it. You could very easily just make an overlaod to do that though. 

issue: I use>>>instead of/deep/any reason I should use deep? 
solution: I was always wondering which one was ‘right'. 

issue: hey people! [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Google results just look unfit [<-CODE->] 
solution: funny. At a first glance it seems that app with AoT approach is slower and bigger than with JiT.vendor bundle remains the same but slower (double time to resolve), while main bundle is double sized and approx. same time to resolve. 

issue: does anybody now if the examples of the angular 2 style-guide ( [<-LINK->] ) are available as whole sample app on github or elsewhere? I cannot find anything via google 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: still not sure if it's better to build this like a base class that pixi components had to implement, or perhaps as a service that transforms components, when injected... (Not clear howto hook into lifcycle hooks). 

issue: Hey@jordic! Are you working your project with webpack? 
solution: ZaimSa: i use webpack for my working project.. 

issue: I search a rish UI library  wich can integarte with Angular  ? have you any idea ! 
solution: eXXeption: I had used Extjs before and when I compare with UI library which I can integarte with angular I found it poor. 

issue: what produces aot compilation? isnt it just js files? in the angular context compilation means from typescript to javascript, right? 
solution: leozulfiu: just as tsc does with typescript, but "translator" or "transpiler" just sounds aweful D: no clue about the official reasoning for calling it a compiler though. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Anyone?? 
solution: that the pattern is invalid. that makes me believe i need to escape it. 

issue: what does the error msg say energy ? it is 
solution: 

issue:  [<-ISSUE->] oh yes my body is ready 
solution: gonzofish: it makes everyone happy [<-LINK->]. sometime in a few weeks or sojuly 13. 

issue: CamusAran: are you trying to edit a native prototype inside a class? 
solution: CamusAran: i didn't think you meant copy-and-paste that code...but that concept, yes, would be great. This is my first project with it. 

issue: o.o 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys, I'm trying to get a reference to a RouterLinkActive on a link which as a ngIf on it. I have tried@ViewChild(RouterLinkActive) and@ViewChildren(RouterLinkActive) but that does not seem to work. Any ideas? 
solution: blaugold: I'd suggest that you refactor your templates so that the element is always there, ie. in a child. If it is active, the element is there. Otherwise you will be getting deep, very deep in the weeds and probably end up doing this anyways.. 

issue: why would [<-CODE->] be saying that subject.next is not a function ? have i defined the observable wrong ? 
solution: 

issue: How do I set a property of a component with data that is only available only afterngAfterViewInitwithout having the dev mode errorExpression has changed after it was checked? Let's say I want to set the width of some child element in a property? Setting it in asetTimeout0 doesn't seem clean to me 
solution: alxhub: This gives an error because the second change detection pass notices a difference. The full message isError in ./TrackMP3Component class TrackMP3Component - inline template:24:199 caused by: Expression has changed after it was checked. Previous value: 'undefined'. Current value: '1605.8125'.. 

issue: finally executed lazarljubenovic: thanks but my login page is not opening hahah plz help in this part 
solution: 

issue: can yarn work with npm side by side? 
solution: when yarn fails, use npm. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: neuberfran: do yourself a favor and simple start with a fresh and clean project. use angular-cli for example, so you don't need to understand the whole thing around and can focus on the code basics.. yeah I joined wednesday and have got no idea how long he maybe was posting this before. 

issue: Why you need an input? 
solution: If you change devastate to something else  it will trigger whatever animation you have defined. right now i have a template parse error that it could not find an animation entry for 'dragState'. 

issue: try evaluating _this if you are doing it in the js code in the console 
solution: just note that to remove that listener you have to save a reference to that bind. 

issue: my ngOnInit does not get called with AOT, is there a solution for that? 
solution: 

issue: Anyone have a pragmatic answer for this... [<-LINK->] 
solution: The problem is named outlets don't work real well yet. so I am stuck resorting to this sort of hacking. * named child outlets and redirects. 

issue: alright. i have a project with nonode_modulesfolder and ready to executeyarn.. should i exec as admin? 
solution: 

issue: Sup lal anyone here started with Ember? 
solution: angular-cli is based on ember.. 

issue: is that a contest for the most wtf question ? 
solution: is angular reactive out of the box?. _dnavas__twitter: yes and no. If you use observable patterns things go much easier. _dnavas__twitter: rxjs is a dependency of angular already. 

issue: Someone knows how to tell me why when I make this request php lose the session [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: Like a template variable? 
solution: 

issue: what's mean : (SystemJS) XHR error (404 Not Found) loading traceur 
solution: I mean@typingmodule .... I update it  ... and it seems make me error ? I don"t know !. 

issue: can we have a<script>tag within a component's html ... ? 
solution: no admin privileges either. top kek. apparently graceful-fs may be the issue i had. it waits for up to a second to rename stuff on windows. 

issue: anyone using aot with material? 
solution: probably becasue it's not input, it's an md-input. as far as I know attributes aren't transative. but I just check the docs and they say it does support ngModel lol, my mistake. In that case yeah, you probably don't have FormsModule imported. Toxicable: Yeah it does, used that the other day :). 

issue: can i give component a template in order to test it? 
solution: have a component used like this. 

issue: on what part? 
solution: 

issue: what does auto import do?  I haven’t seen that feature yet in webstorm 
solution: babeal: alt + enter on red class name will auto-import if it can, or resolve by name and let you choose exact location of what you want to import. 

issue: Extract the form to a pure component of inputs/outputs and pass it the user subscription? <user-form [user]="user$ | async"></user-form> 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] any ideas? 
solution: now i\'m trying to have a "playground" folder in my lib and point cli to it. so i can keep compiling and publishing the lib only but so i can actually see the lib in action and test it from the project itself. 

issue: find a similar component in material/ng bootstrap 
solution: i used to check material often earlier. but i think [<-LINK->] will suffice, gonna try it now. 

issue: fuck sorry u_u 
solution: lazarljubenovic: I like it =) Good devs talking tech. Not like stackoverflow chat which became memes chats.... also you're here at wrong times if you don't see memes and talks about tv shows :P.

solution: 

issue: Where can I git clone the [<-LINK->] exampe from? 
solution: TyrfingMjolnir: could you report that as an issue at [<-LINK->]. 

issue: nearly afternoon (monday) 
solution: (i think we should change that in v3, you should have to explicitly include the CommonModule. having it mixed in with BrowserModule is confusing). 

issue: So back to my question, is APP_INITAILIZER supposed to wait for promise to resolve before initializing the App or just the module in which it is declared as provider ? 
solution: still accurate, more or less. 

issue: generally your genDir should be a child of your src folder 
solution: yeah I thought something like that was happening since I see it erroing out for files that don't exist on disk. 

issue: Ahh, that’s very helpful to know.  I was looing at modules as features and creating a tree in my head.  So where the module is imported doesn’t form the scope for services except maybe in the lazy load scenario? 
solution: We have lots of different services and depending on deployment have differnent authentication headers and jwt tokens, etc.  The abstraction is that the service import a generic http like service that is configured at the root.  The service that the components use are the domain services, like UsersService or whatever.. 

issue: did you import it right? 
solution: no idea, never heard of seen it. it only has 1 commit, so I doubt it's up to a good standard. ohk. 

issue: im hoping once im done with this i can release publicly 
solution: jjstreet: i never played dnd and it was never interesting to me but after living through your project i'd love to see that :P. jjstreet: are you implementing it with rxjs? (It's one of the ideas that had came to my head lasts weeks ) :). 

issue: how do I implement communication between two components if they do not have the relation as parent-child? 
solution: 

issue: Hi. Is it right channel to talk about my angular2 problem? 
solution: I am trying to build datatable component in Angular2. Now i have something like this and it works: [<-CODE->] But i need extra functionality. I need sometimes (not always) to put extra column with action buttons. And it should looks like: [<-CODE->] And i dont know how do that.. 

issue: Finally I make it work my first package :)  [<-LINK->] 
solution: and don't want to import another big dependency, when I have also imported observables.. 

issue: they listen to both input and change eventand it's a bug :) 
solution: hmm that works i suppose. 

issue: how do i implement searchable dropdown or autocomplete 
solution: 

issue: Is this the correct syntax for ngFor in a template? [<-CODE->] 
solution: jjstreet: An array ofSection[]which is just an interface of two strings, added like so: [<-CODE->]. 

issue: Hello! Could you please tell me what is the best way to reload component? I tried to navigate to the same route but it doesn't work:this.router.navigate(%path%, { queryParams: {} });I'm using latest version of angular (2.2.1) 
solution: 

issue: I’ll try with a different approach, maybe I can fix this with only interfaces :)@lazarljubenovicthanks 
solution: http get with basic auth I think is just a header.... 

issue: when using a resolver, how can I pass data without using url parameters? Im just trying to set up a resolver class that loads an image before activating a rout 
solution: 

issue: isdispatchEvent()importable anymore? 
solution: 

issue: scarmarco: make sure your selector is as specific as the one you're trying to overwrite 
solution: Had success with/deep/. let cellrow of round.cells; let cellindex = index;. 

issue: manipulating classes? there are ... 4 solutions at least 
solution: or if you have to do event handling. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: Best practices question:should reactive form building be done in the constructor or in ngOnInit? 
solution: buddyackerman: because if you're sending in data as@Inputyou can be more assured the data is available. buddyackerman: I do an initial one in the init, them update in the setter for the input. 

issue: hey all, i’m on v 2.0, what is the correct shim to use for Ie?  my app breaks in i.e. 10 or is that a oft repeated question? 
solution: daddyschmack: that page has all hte polyfills you need to get it working on ie10. 

issue: is there any way to check if component has input or not inside constructor? [<-CODE->] 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: you mean if the input is being used?. DzmitryShylovich: cant you create a "help-var:number" and check this one?. 

issue: Anyone has an example of ReactiveForms with formGroups ?? 
solution: It seems i cannot attach formGroupName.

issue: How do I refresh a@HostBinding(''),markForCheck()doesn't work :/ 
solution: I have a parent somewhere that uses ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush. 

issue: Hi everyone,I have prob with the router.I have set this config: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: Could I use it with the router.navigate?. Found the prob. I should use   // Navigate with relative linkthis.router.navigate([crisis.id], { relativeTo: this.route });. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: I got it to work as you explained, thank you!. DzmitryShylovich: Actually I ended up usingprivate Math = window['Math'];because the typescript compiler is not happy withprivate Math = window.Math;. PhotoPaul: creating a pipe is more elegant. n00dl3: You are right, but this is already part of a 3 piece pipe so I thought of keeping it simple. Maybe if I need to use it again I will convert it into a pipe. 

issue: you had a long day@lazarljubenovic you too@DzmitryShylovich 
solution: yes i even put my shirt on. anyway, if no one else says it.. We appreciate you guys. 

issue: have u seen how polymer cmps are distributed?@emilaasa it's 100500 js/html files 
solution: No I haven't looked into it much, took a quick look a while a go and it looked pretty daunting.. 

issue: angular doesn't attach view by cords 
solution: position:fixed with top/left. will try it out now :). 

issue: anyone know how to make ayanc/await call in a loop 
solution: emilaasa: for(let i=0;i<array.length;i++){this.sendToServer(array[i]);}async sendToServer(){await this.someService.post();}. emilaasa: i want to get response for each data sent to server.. 

issue: how component inheritance is a breaking change? 
solution: if someone is inheriting now and relying on metadata not being copied properly. it's not against the rules to do that atm really. 

issue: Typescript in the browser when 
solution: ahah. lazarljubenovic: js is. DzmitryShylovich: people who refuse to learn it properly and call it  are.

issue: How do I implement multiple lifecycle hooks? what is the syntax for that? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] Please ignore my post above - made in error 
solution: 

issue: is there some tutorial, articles anything more than the official docs aboutIterableDiffers? 
solution: 

issue: is that a built in jasmine matcher? 
solution: so you could escape that test by not passing a comparator. 

issue: any hints about destroying the component from within itself? 
solution: thought that on pressing enter i could fire an event and destroy itself. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] @lukealization_twitteri don't think you can, rob mentioned that their compiler doesn't recognize it 
solution: lukealization_twitter: if only...was supported in templates,let keyValuePair of [...map]would be the easiest thing to do atm. 

issue: how to google? 
solution: type "yahoo" in address bar\nclick first result\ntype "google" in search bar\nclick first result\n???\nprofit. Worked... sometimes google is smart!. 

issue: why are popups not placed where they should be? 
solution: at least some really big feature in material. @intellixlike people using BS4/Semtanic-UIthen they already have a grid system :). 

issue: Hi, I just used angular 2 with the cli, it's my first try. But server live-reload doesn't work, I always have to cance the server and run it again. Is this some known problem? I tried it in vscode and webstorm. I googled around but could not finde anything. 
solution: 

issue: Switched my javascript indent to 2 from 4 because all the examples were with 2 
solution: or×. now who in the world wants to do that, especially with japanese where you also need to remember if it' hiragana/katakana/kanji, that's another story. 

issue: hello guys, Is there an example of how to implement loading in ngrx? 
solution: robwormald: you bought all the coffee in the world; share the wealth, man. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: I tried it and decided it was still immature several times.. 

issue: anyone here aware what is the main reason to use Observable instead of Promise within the Http angular module? 
solution: Toxicable: afaik, a promise can return a promise, which may result in the same behavior. Could you give an example please?. aaah, alright. I got it now. So promises can actually return promises, however, they type will also stack. Thanks. But then, why is there a need to call another http call when one finishes? Is there some kind of streaming implemented?. 

issue: dafuk does this mean? [<-CODE->] 
solution: from your linter? it should probably be smart enough to know that you're using that type. 

issue: Hello I want to learn angular2 how can i start? 
solution: create new project with angular-cli and follow the tutorials if you are having problems with the setup. mosamy19: That's probably your best resource, with the fast pace that the team is iterating on the framework it's kidna hard for external guides to make up to date guides. 

issue: the hero editor shows how to handle objects in the view the link@Toxicableshared 
solution: 

issue: is it neccessory to declare services in@Component's providers key ? 
solution: is the global declaration better you think?. if by global you mean in the top level Module, then yes. Or if you're following the guild on angular.io then your Core Module. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] ? 
solution: yeah angular 3 coming in march. it means there will be some breaking changes. 

issue: the only thing I don't like is how much boilerplate you have to writeif we could just define the store model then have some of sick Typed way of dispatchin g i'd be super happy 
solution: dmccaffery: you know what, I feel kinda silly now, never thought about making a generic one. 

issue: If I want to make a global loading bar, what do I hook into? 
solution: CamusAran: make a service. 

issue: .delay 
solution: Observables are cool. 

issue: what do you mean by "configurable service"? 
solution: 

issue: decorating Http is painful as HELL 
solution: also have to handle that it can be a string.

issue: So has the world of ANgular2 already migrated away from the system.js and towards the WebPack ways of doing things ? 
solution: MitchellGeek: you somwhere have an ngIf condition whose value changes during a change detection cycle. It could be hiding your modal or anything else. without some code it's hard to tell. it doesn't even have to be a ngIf, the error can come from multiple sources, but ' Has it been created in a change detection hook' makes it sound as if.

solution: 

issue: stephanjust: what import plugin for vscode ? 
solution: comeUpWithItLater: I currently use "TypeScript Importer". When accepting a class proposal from intellisense it automatically adds the import if missing. If you wrote it yourself it adds a TsLint like help via a popup menu, allowing you to import it. 

issue: when dynamicaly creating components, can I still somehow bind stuff with directives like ngIf? 
solution: so i have a component created with CFR and now i want to show/hide it on button click => i need an ngIf => how do i "attach" ngIf to the component i created dynamically?.

issue: Any idea's at what point of a router routing it calls the resolve functions? 
solution: I have 2 components A, BA contains a list, B can contain details of the selected item from Awhen you click and item from A it routes you to B component which has a resolve method to get information on that itemhowever, when you go from B back to A the same reolve method checks the url to see if the id is there, if it isnt then it removes it from the Storesince B is still subscribed to the id that just got removed it throws an error. 

issue: Given: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Right now all the above is doing is settingmyControlto either false or true. 
solution: lukealization_twitter: I don't expect this to work, but maybe you could do myControl[0]. Disregard what I say, I'd google for angular2 checkbox group or w/e. @lukealization_twitter I believe docs will just suggest to use different entries e.g.value1: controlvalue2: control etc.You could make a separate formGroup to have them as a mapped value, but you'll probably need to convert it to an array anyways. Maybe not.. 

issue: Element? With a pipe you should only get a value. I think you can output html though if you wan to 
solution: If you want the element then you need ot make a directoive. Toxicable: you mean, we need follow this guide [<-LINK->].

solution: mug3n: I've got a decorator that I've found and altered for my use ( [<-LINK->] ) but I need to add tests and I have no idea how to do the setup or really test this thing. sonicparke: it depends on what you want to test, but regardless, I'd advise getting the boilerplate and adjusting the tests for your uses. 

issue: PHP <3 
solution: so everyone use MEAN stack?. I don't use express.

solution: 

issue: I have a simple form : [<-CODE->] And when I submit : [<-CODE->] I don't understand why it's not working ... I also declared in the module : [<-CODE->] 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: I gave you the plunkr link ( [<-LINK->] ) but forgot to @ you. Yeah I tried that and I was surprised to see that it works. BUT, I want to pass thelogin.valueinstead of'a'to login function. 

issue: guys it's saturday what are you doing here 
solution: :). 

issue: Hiwho have a ready example of routing the components? (angularjs 1.5 JS) thank you 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: just a typo, but problem is still relevant :/ I'll make a plunker.. 

issue: does your app's package.json have all@angular/*packages as deps? 
solution: then it should work. the warnings should be abou version mismatch though, not about "but none was installed". weird. Ha@DzmitryShylovichI should have noticed that.  :-). awesome!. 

issue: are you doing all of this in template literals withouttemplateUrlbuttemplate? 
solution: :(. 

issue: too many people on webstorm will have to try it

solution: because you can instantiate that service with different dependencies. you can provide either xhr or websockets to that same service. if the url was a constant dependency etc. 

issue: is not customizable yet? 
solution: Australhawk: , may you take a look to primeng components, they are decents: ( I am not spreading like advertise, no worry) :)Not sure about license... [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->]. Australhawk: @daddyschmack,The only thing I observed few months ago to primefaces is that they didn't implement 100% native angular2 components. Somewhere they wrapped their existing components and provided for angular2 use.I guess this is for a short time, until they'll have some time to recreate using native.

solution: that's fine, the http will complete after the first emit, same as .then(). 

issue: EmptyError: no elements in sequence Does anyone know why this error occurs? 
solution: There are no elements in the sequence. You're probably trying to do something on an empty list or such. 

issue: btw, is the $ suffix from some style guide? 
solution: they use it in the docs, but i think it's just a convention. this guy sure has an interesting github presence: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: so if i want to load a module with its routes using loadChildren, how do i prevent the lazy loading? 
solution: xban1x: using loadChildren with a string seems to imply lazy loading. i want to route to a module without that. how is that done.

issue: thanks@hungerregnuh 
solution: ketchupmonkey: np, work for ya?. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] How do you debug when you get this? 
solution: I basically needed to create 2 directives to put into a component, but the recommended path was to make 2 components and import them into another component, but directive:[] is no longer supported.. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: ericmartinezr: , it worked, thnx. now i need to find out what is NgZone, thnx@ericmartinezr. obeyda:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: ng-bootstrap.github.iolol did u type it? 
solution: 

issue: Hi everyone. Does someone who know how make pipe globally without using shared module. Angular 2.2. 
solution: Madlexx: even angular built in pipe aren't global. I need global translator pipe, which will work in any child module. Using shared module for pipe isn't good decision. 

issue: Hello guys, angular material, has component to display notifications?

solution: DzmitryShylovich: you're so predictable i knew you'd say that :). 

issue: So off subject a bit but has anyone used normalizr? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] wut do you know abouttemplateUrlandstyleUrls? 
solution: does it count as "angular app" if you make angular application with a single component and just do all jquery stuff inside it?. wow i didn't see the topic change in gitter.

solution: 

issue: kinda how abbreviations generally work 
solution: nonon you cant use unicode remember. i can't find that suggestion for inputs/outputs to be.:and:..

solution: Because I take the initial action and final action of each effect, to change the state of my load bar. 

issue: are you sending the three files as an array to the worker? or sending them as distinct messages? 
solution: because switchMap cancels the previous request if a new one comes down the pipe. 

issue: how many pipes do u have? 
solution: which is kinda the definition of pipe for me -- transforming data around just so it fits in another model. doesn\'t belong to either of the components which are comunicating, but it\'s literally a "channel" (pipe) between them.. 

issue: use(ngModelChange)instead ofvalueChanges 
solution: you use ngModel. you mean instead of doing it in one call [()] to break it up?. 

issue: I'm not sure if I should do that modification, I didn't setup the architecture in this project. Also, the font-icons are mainly a repo of icons for use in the project. So I would just use the class of the icon I need. 
solution: Ranguro: it's hard to say, I personally think that trying to keep most things styles related in css is a good idea, sepertion of concerns and what not, however I understand that you have come into a project part of the way through so might not be sure of the ramifications of a change like that. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] fill inthe blanks 
solution: Toxicable: I see and agree.subscribe()is now accepted.  But I get an error onthis.http.get(url, this.standardOptions(token)): "supplied parameters do not match any signature of the call target".   I assume that the call refers tothis.http.get.  The call tohttp.getin the code below succeeds, so I am at a loss for an explanation. [<-CODE->]. 

issue: is it possible to make a dynamic component that takes a FormArray as an@Inputparameter? 
solution: richardjprice: well then be more specific. i.e. can the dynamic component add FormArray items back to the parent FormGroup. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] another kick ass article by tero 
solution: Generating portal... [<-LINK->]. If using CLI, known issue; if not, continue with your error message. 

issue: mmmm no? the aot plugin does all of the above 
solution: 

issue: I'm tring to optimize a vendor cli generated... Any idea what can I strip? 
solution: jordic: you could drop those pollyfills if you're doing it for a demo or something?. 

issue: @jjstreetwhats the problem exactly?some people want to always reuse a component and some people want always to recrate a component 
solution: 

issue: so I need to add an Id to each object ? 
solution: so probably better add it to the object as an id. 

issue: hi mates, i have a problem with host listeners, any expert here? 
solution: if I extend and use the subclass, the parent hostlistener isn't triggered?. 

issue: html and css are turned into code, so you don't need the templates why do you need the instance of NgFor? 
solution: yeah, that might work. 

issue: you want the ngFor instance ?

issue: might be undefined distinctUntillChanged? 
solution: 

issue: istiti: how do you link child form and parent form ? 
solution: ghetolay: what is the best way to achieve this : link childForm component inside parenForm without duplicate  html template from childForm ?. ghetolay: don't have, I wonder how achieve this. 

issue: istiti: Are you trying to build a "parent" form out of child component forms? istiti: why not create your child components like this : 
solution: @istiti  in your child form component do this [<-CODE->] then in your parent component do this: [<-CODE->] don't wrap the controls in the child form components in a formgroup, only use a formgroup in the parent (unless you actually want sub-formgroups).This is a bit of a guess at the structure and I've never tried it so you might have to play with a it a little (a lot) to get it to work.. 

issue: intellix: you've seen the newNgIfsyntax right? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-ISSUE->] @intellixbeleive this was blocking you

issue: Hi, how do we iterate thrue an object in template with *ngFor in angular 2? 
solution: shral: you cant. 

issue: Did any of you see the posts on reddit about it? 
solution: I would hope so!. It's a controversial decision to skip v3 because of router. 

issue: 4.0 ? wtf someone help me understand [<-LINK->] :) 
solution: I knew about Semver but thougt it was 3 not 4 :) either way thanks for the literature. 

issue: hello my friends 
solution: jjstreet:  [<-LINK->]. i believe formGroupArray requires a number as the group name. you'll probably want to change that one too.

issue: Hey guys, [<-CODE->] 
solution: josephliccini: I can\'t say for sure, but I think the "most equivalent" option is ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush (assuming I understand what one-time binding operator did in ng1). 

issue: Are you using on push? 
solution: Are you vertain, on push is in retired from patents. 

issue: Hi all. Can u help me with SystemJS, please? 
solution: sinedsem: use webpack instead. np. so I should go to angular2-webpack guide?. 

issue: both on the same file ? 
solution: 

issue: what's LGTM? right 
solution: 

issue: I subscribe after I create the form. 
solution: ngModel and ngrx/store are sort of at odds, since one assumes mutation and the other does not. So should I be going fully down the reactive path? I have a couple cases where I need select boxes to trigger changes to other form elements.. 

issue: how do I access properties of the component from inside a .subscribe() on a formControl? 
solution: I tried that but was getting told it was undefined which is only possible if the scope of “this” is different.. 

issue: man, whatwillthey do while waiting 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: dam son, even more PR's than a normal day today. :).

issue: Hi there. Does anyone know if this is possible? => [<-LINK->] thanks so much. 
solution: nikkwong: the registerOnChange and writeValue are the out and in interfaces. If defined that way it works for either ngModel or reactive forms.. 

issue: anyone know how to make Subjects typesafe? I want to be sure I am passing only booleans with a subject 
solution: Toxicable: I havepublic mystream$: Subject<any> = new Subject();. but if I switch outanyforboolean, doesn't like it. mildfuzz: mystream$: Subject<boolean> = new Subject<boolean>();. 

issue: anyone any idea why i get a hell of 404s if i import Observable into a plunker? 
solution: 

issue: pkozlowski-opensource: are u here? 
solution: 

issue: yeah, i dont get invited to those meetings 
solution: 

issue: where would i put that right after my export ? 
solution: It does not matter, you can follow the Angular pattern and have a class with a bunch of static validators exported. Srgjames_twitter: if you want to change as little as possible, just change your method to take a formgroup as an argument and use the formgroups get methods to get the properties you need to compare. 

issue: When a component subscribe to an observable from a service and the next value is recieved. It does not trigger change detection, does it ? 
solution: No but I modify objects in an array of objects and the change is not displayed in the html, I'd like to know if it is the normal behavior. @cedvdbNo but I modify objects in an array of objectssounds like u need to create a new array. 

issue: its just an imperative API, no? 
solution: So it dosen't? I know it would literally make 0 pref differance since it's a single tiny string. virusakos_twitter: woot no never said that,npm install @types/jasmine. ghetolay: you didn’t. Google did. 'angular cli jasmine typings’ leads to [<-ISSUE->]. 

issue: what error d you see? do you*

solution: 

issue: is there any good way of controlling subscriptions and other initialization stuff between components? 
solution: serviceA subscribes to serviceB and creates observableA; component1 tries to subscribe to observableA in component1's ngOnInit. but apparently observableA hasn't been created yet when component1's ngOnInit method gets invoked. 

issue: If two components in different modules require the same service what is the best way to implement this other than importing that service twice. 
solution: Let's add a SharedModule to hold the common components, directives, and pipes and share them with the modules that need them.. 

issue: jeanres: did you solve problem with supplied params? 
solution: Sounded like he was wasn't passing the right number of parameters into the function. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] But I can't get it to work, what should the expression be? 
solution: chrillewoodz: Well I guess it depends onoptionso you could checkoption?. ghetolay: idk.. it seems to be counting things that aren't even in my template as childnodes... 

issue: so@chrillewoodzthe app.component shoukld in essence be my dashboard? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: Is there is any why to solve this on the angular end, becoz this type of issue will generate every time when the apis we want to hit are changed,.

issue: what is the new signature for pluck() ? 
solution: ekarlso: rxjs has three different branches on github where they work on several versions. Sometimes it is a bit confusing. Just make sure that your version is the same that angular2 currently uses and everything should be fine. 

issue: how to fix this error?Error: No provider for ActivatedRouteSnapshot!i importRouterModule 
solution: tsm91: because ActivatedRouteSnapshot in not injactable. u can only inject Router and ActivatedRoute from router module. 

issue: how do you get a route parameter in the latest version ? 
solution: I tried fixing it earlier but obviously going something wrong :(. 

issue: how can I get a list of classes from my hosting component? without using jQuery :) 
solution: 

issue: If I use changeDetectorRef.detectChanges(), does that trigger change detection throughout the whole change detection tree or is it just the  component that calls the method and all of that component's children?

issue: i believe so@cambronjay  [<-LINK->] 
solution: Like when you use a subscription it will on emit a value that has changed. I am wondering if it only applies when you use the async pipe.

issue: so angular universal for disabled js, and seo? 
solution: nerdfilesBut I guess I would say Angular Universal's SEO benefit is in virtue of the fact that JS Enabled is not assumed..

issue: so u are already familiar with annotations and di 
solution: i find the types are a little verbose. i mean most of my experience is in js, and i've been doing functional development for a while. doing all this tight coupling, and state management is killing me. 

issue: any d3 people on? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] sexy x) 
solution: pantonis: probably a check if an auth token exists in localstorage. 

issue: How can i make a domain address ? 
solution: 

issue: select (or subscribe) will always deliver you the current state synchronously 
solution: 

issue: are there easy gains from say defining return values, with marginal gains with other aspects applied? 
solution: generally if you can properly type the public API surface, that\'ll help a lot. closure advanced is sort of "OFF" or "ON" so it takes a bit of fiddling. the other thing is JSON coming in from APIs has to be properly typed, or it renames properties and everything breaks. 

issue: How can i redirect to an external url from class? 
solution: The solution I made to fix this is to have another field called isAuthReady. kiokotzu: I believe that window.location is your only way to go to an external URL in JS. 

issue: So anyone know where the angular language services VSC extension repo is 
solution: born2net: it's not a mem leak, unless you're manage the sub of it manually. but everytime i call that method, it will generate a new subscription through the@effect, since if I don\'t have the take(1) it will "wait" for more future streams.

solution: You can call a service from anywhere. I just want import one time, and could use every where without importing more times the service. 

issue: does yourTwoComponenthave a router outlet? 
solution: (was a rhetorical question to support self-enlightenment). 

issue: Would the websocket observable trigger the router location code? The codestacks are pointing that direction 
solution: @LunicLynx Let me track down all the subscriptions (BTW thanks for all your help)It seems the problem is here... [<-CODE->] (circa 656 router.js)This map gets called 2x the first time _a is a boolean (false) the next time it is an object. The first time is the time it fails reseting the url the second is the valid one.. so you'll be probably better of with@DzmitryShylovichapproach. I'm not sure what the impact could be if you go the other way.preventDefault()is just one part of it, you also need to invoke the router. So the best case would be to invoke the template parser directly. But havent seen any example of that yet, so it might not be feasible.. 

issue:  29 de diciembre de 2016 9:33anyone? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: OpaqueToken {_desc: "BASE_PATH"}. try to change type from string to any.

solution: 

issue: is 'directives' still available in@component?  [<-CODE->]

issue: what a sadism 
solution: 

issue: Services are singletons in their injector ... 
solution: wKoza: yes, but I need to inject that injector in my component. That doesn't solve my problem :). Toxicable: : An Angular application is a tree of components. Each component instance has its own injector! The tree of components parallels the tree of injectors. Since many a times have people asked inhere why their service is screwed and the reason being that they defined it in a component. It's not only that services are singletons(excluding lazy loaded modules and arrives defined in components) but they should be Singleton's as are their nature. 

issue: I'm usingimport {Observable} from 'rxjs';--- what is the correct library to import in my vendor list? I don't want that Observable code in my apps code. thanks 
solution: vigohe: alright, I had toimport 'rxjs/Observable'in my vendors.ts and thenimport {Observable} from 'rxjs/Observable';instead offrom 'rxjs'-- now the codes are moved into my vendors.js. jordic: thx, It would have been cool if ngOnDestroy emits a observable by default. So I can just unsubscribe automatically to the observables when the component get destroy with the takeUntil operator like: [<-CODE->].

solution: yes... but more like [ { sk1: 'foo', sk3: 'bar' } , { sk1: '2foo', sk3: '2bar' } ,  { sk1: '3foo', sk3: '3bar' }  ]. 

issue: this._renderer.attachViewAfter(document.querySelector('body'), something.nativeElement);- this should add the element to body? 
solution: don't think it's make much sense to use renderer if u already did document.querySelector('body'). 

issue: new year new dnd questions? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: eventually. and haven't coded in 2 weeks. 

issue: you can't ?  [<-CODE->] is how i think i remember doing it in a anngFor 
solution: same problem, you're creating a new object each time. so then havengForloop over the objects you pass to the context. 

issue: I have a question about angular 2 and observables, can anyone help me with that? 
solution: So I am in desparate need of a good doc for observables with angular 2. I had an app built so nicely with services and chaining promises. 

issue: What problem did you run into@hmouhtar? 
solution: If you don't know how the build tools work then I'd suggest using angular-cli. 

issue: I heard that angular universal is going to be imported in angular/core ? is it true? 
solution: Mohendran: This quarter, early betas coming soon. 

issue: with@ContentChildreni got a QueryList of components. how do i know which directives are attached to them? 
solution: lazarljubenovic: Only way I can think of is to useelementRef.nativeElement.attributeswhich is not good. 

issue: is there a way to build a modal in angular ? 
solution: well i was using bootstrap modal but i cant close it with angular as well it looks like bootstrap is going to be removing them. Or you can use fuel-ui or ng2-bootstrap, as listed in angular's resources.. 

issue: How are Angular Components recognized and bootstrapped? I have a thirdparty js library which is manipulating the DOM inside of a component and I would like child components to be recognized and registered (as well as removed cleanly). 
solution: alxhub: The third-party js I am using emits events when it changes the DOM, so I could also add components in a different way rather than adding tags and asking Angular to recognize it. Would there be a way to do that?. 

issue: anyone here knows how to edit the url bar of a plunkr? I asked of course in the plunkr channel but its dead... 
solution: 

issue: component selectors with>still not supported? 
solution: yeah bad. now i have to namespace my selectors -_-. 

issue: Get the element and access.styleon it? 
solution: I guess I can just a plain old object. just figured an enum was the semanticly right tool for enumerating all my template types. Matmo10: You can cast enum to array. 

issue: afternoon 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: robwormald: I had to figure out how to have angular-cli project suck in a new js file automatically, then install this library. assuming you a) install chart.js from npm and b) are using a node-aware tool (like webpack) then yes, that's generally all you have to do. 

issue: Is there any way of preserving component state when leaving for another route? I know one - using service 
solution: sinedsem: A service can be an easy way to do this, otherwise some implementation of state management like ngrx/Store or Redux. 

issue: can angular 2 be used to make a non single page application? 
solution: mlc-mlapis: I mean, a dashboard type application which shows multiple views and navigation instead a single view. 

issue: can we change the default ChangeDetectionStrategy to OnPush ? 
solution: It will do on the rest of the tree .... jordic: indeed. wanted to see if my app worked with OnPush everywhere, this is a good way to quickly test it. 

issue: Hi all!Is it possible to have a form without the [formGroup] attribute, while using the reactive forms? 
solution: 

issue: Can I lazyload modules wthout the router? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] I am getting this error at time of importing ng2-charts in app.module.ts 
solution: 

issue: You mean peer dep? 
solution: if you're building a plugin for angular, you should peerDep on angular. if you're building a plugin that requires a 3rd party, its debatable if that should be peer or not. Right, I guess if the lib you're making is gonna be the only one using chat.js in a project there's no point making it a peer dep. does the angular-cli projects have a folder I can slap extra js into thats included in the abstracted webpack config. 

issue: i have a dashboard where i want to show different charts... what is the best pratice... all of them on the same template+component or each chart each component? 
solution: 

issue: looks likeAppShellis missing the@NgModuleannotation 
solution: previously it is working when I do bootstrap(AppShell). But it is not working if I do platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppShell);. sagar12861: you mean 8 months ago ?. When I was using jspm as dependency module.. I use to import it as import { bootstrap } from'@angular/platform/browser';. 

issue: Question: Could you load an angular 2 module based on a route? 
solution: 

issue: is model relationships possible? 
solution: but doing user._role.name says that the role is undefined. 

issue: what about docs? 
solution: I was using it before it was merged into master actually. Started using angular and stole it from his presentation repos. the amount of things we've literally just had to invent solutions for is mind boggling. 

issue: Would there still be an app compiled for every language? 
solution: if somebodyreallywants to do something useful, starting an electron xliff/i18n editor app would be cool. yeah seems to be a real lack of good free options. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: Toxicable: there's a live stream of these 2 bots chattinghttps://www.twitch.tv/seebotschat:).

solution: EreckGordon: has a cat. 

issue: I have a angular2 app in production that talks to a Ruby backend, but it’s still all API based, so the language of the backend wouldn’t matter@LarishoWhat specifically do you need help with? 
solution: jesmith17: I want to serve the dist folder in production. I tried using Tomcat, Apache, and Glassfish as servers but they do not support the routing used by angular, as far as I can tell. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: thx, but looks ugly and does not work withng-containerinstead ofdiv:(. 

issue: the angular inline component elements are causing me massive grief across browsers with layout 
solution: in Safari if you have a display: flex -> display: inline ->  height: 100%; it can't work out the full height because the inline blocks it (but only in Safari). 

issue: can anyone tell the $apply equivalent of ng1 in ng-x. Is it zones? CD? 
solution: just search for Change Detection and angular then you should be able to find whatever you're looking for. 

issue: ??? 
solution: 

issue: any suggestions to integrate cli into vscode? 
solution: yeah run cli commands in vscode. MurhafSousli: then you could just merge map from your timer into that observable directly. 

issue: google? 
solution: if you go to google and type 'learn angular 2' it will give you links to youtub and angular.io (that connects everything). 

issue: hey folks, another dynamically placed components question: how can I get aViewContainerReffor an element at runtime dynamically? 
solution: 

issue: How do I navigate to a route and pass data to its resolver? 
solution: After successfully submitting a create resource form I get the resource back from the api, I then want to redirect to the resource :id route, but that would then request the data I already have from the api. 

issue: can you paste link to gz here 
solution: erm, it stands for gzipping. :|. but dam thats not bad. 

issue: no american m/d/y format in aus? :( 
solution: that date format is almost as bad as their system for measuring things. is it true that they have a huge need for coders in AUS@Toxicable.

issue: How do I trigger all validators in a form on submit? 
solution: 

issue: what, typing? 
solution: 

issue: Hello here, [<-CODE->] 
solution: Lowell130: this is an Angular error, this place would help too! thanks. Lowell130: so you need to use something like NativeScript or Iconic to run Angular on a mobile. 

issue: At which version could I start using the new "ngIf" (the one with reactive powers)? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: Will location.back work same as routerLink? or is it going to take me back to the state of the previous component?. DzmitryShylovich: Yeah, it's not what I'm looking for- but it's good to know about it. I wanted the previous state. I guess I will have to use EventEmitters for these purposes then.. 

issue: morning all 
solution: so I’m week 4 in to angular and I’m loving it. rough start but I’m pretty happy with what I’ve got so far. 

issue: guys, where can I follow for angular2 and angular-cli updates?

solution: 

issue: Are you using OnPush? 
solution: *no. 

issue: Angular HTTP module? 
solution: You're probably running it outside of angular then, try it with a zone.run(). 

issue: Hey guys, with static methods on modules, does .withConfig() make sense for passing config to the module? I should I use the usual .forRoot() 
solution: Toxicable: I have the idea that using aforRoot()argument to create a{ provide: Config, useValue: argument }provider is an acceptable pattern.. 

issue: Hi! Is it possible to inherit component but do not declare template in derived? 
solution: your best bet is to either NOT use inheritance (and use composition instead) - or you could store the template in a separate html file, which you will have to reference in your new component. 

issue: I\'ve got a table where the rows repeat and are clickable.  However, the class attribute does not get the "clickable" value. Is this normal? 
solution: 

issue: m 
solution: 

issue: anyway to jump with router.navigate to an anker tag? *anchor 
solution: masaanli:  [<-LINK->] but i haven't tried, yet. I ried ng2-page-scroll but not seems to work with lazy routes... 

issue: Question, if you have a function that's being triggered inngOnInit()do you always have to dongOnDestroy()as well? 
solution: estradamarkie: yes if you subscribe to observable, or register listener to dom events, you should most probably unsubscribe onngOnDestroy(). 

issue: guys, why does--aotis not the defaultng buildoption? for example? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: i will write a book "The Mysterious Poker Smile of Dz". 

issue:  [<-CODE->] TIL: how to freeze the page 101 
solution: 

issue: any one can direct me to an example of using enum in angular-2, I am struggling importing the enum into another file to use? 
solution: daBishMan: there's no difference in using enums or classes or interfaces. u need to export it then import. 

issue: how is http interception angular 1 specific? 
solution: ahmedlafta: it's not, it's just where it primarily comes from because that was the hip thing to do back then. Toxicable: i think it's still a very important thing to have. are you aware of any alternative approaches to having a single point to modify a request/response?. Instead of using an interceptor, you wrap it in your own logic. 

issue: how to load component dynamically ? 
solution: lazarljubenovic: , I am fetching html data through REST APi and there is a (click) function inside dynamic htmland the (click) function not working. 

issue: Am I doing this right? [<-CODE->]

issue: hello everyone, how do i increment a number when a *ngIf true occurs? 
solution: 

issue: anyone have advice for my problem above ^^ 
solution: kylecannon: I havn't used upgrade or downgrade. all examples I see have theViewContainerRefwhich loads the module, and renders the component. I need to register the component that was lazily loaded in for use at a later time. 

issue: are you importing the module? I mean, in theimports : []property I think that's the property, lol  [<-LINK->] 
solution: ericmartinezr: yes, inside myapp.module.tsi have: [<-CODE->]. And i use it in temlate like this. [<-CODE->]. I confused because of this library appearance. I think it doesn't look like a module. [<-LINK->]. 

issue: is there a Plunkr for ngrx ? Cannot find any ... 
solution: 

issue: I believe u can navigate inside your resolver 
solution: Yes, indeed you can, but I need to go to the "previous" route, not some predefined route. shylent: have you seen the auth service in the official router docs? There they have a redirectUrl. Isn't this a similiar use case?. 

issue: Just out of curiosity, what is the breaking change in 2.1? I recently upgraded my Angular 2.4.3 app to use TS 2.1.5, is this something I should be worried about? 
solution: 

issue: nobody called me out on not mentioning npm? :( I wanted an argument 
solution: 

issue: did you configure your server to redirect? 
solution: no. did you configure your server to redirect?. 

issue: is it a good idea to use theshareoperator at the end of a selector ? 
solution: maxime1992: there is a workaround uisng an smart component that pipes to a presentational one. Also I think that in 4 the ngIF will offer a local bound variable to avoid the multiple subscription. jordic: it's not a workaround to create a dumb component but sometimes if you just need to display like 2 fields it might be overkill .... 

issue: How is this [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: seveves: are you sure? if i export that component it does work, if i dont export it, its not known.. and the error stays the same. 

issue: now that some more are here... why is this [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: How can i extend this, [<-LINK->] 
solution: ghetolay: Extend component and change template. If i write super instead of constructor it doesn't work. 

issue: Question: What is the best way to implement a file based logging for Angular 2.0 application ? Suggesstions please ... or any recommendation for git repos 
solution: actually we have a very good loggin mechnasim for our back-end. The need is to build a good robust logging mechnism for the front-end so that we can trace what happened if something goes wrong..

issue: is there an abstract static class? 
solution: is there static classes?. I don't know.... 

issue: hey guys was wondering how to make this in angular [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: There's an option in angular-cli--extract-cssWhat's the pro/const ? i think we're supposed to use that in dev so our JS is not compiled again and again if we're just touching the SCSS for example.But what about prod ? Is it better to have styles in js or css ? 
solution: Toxicable: The problem is that because the URL did not change between navigating away from and returning to the component that displays the motion jpegs, the browser returned the last frames of the motion jpegs that it had in it's cache when it instantiated the new component. I added a &timestamp with the current time to the end of the URL's and now it makes the requests as it should.. 

issue: I want to lazy load this, when app is booted:  [<-LINK->] any ideas how to take it.. 
solution: or even better plan than that, remake it in modern js like i sorta tried to :P. 

issue: i want to ask a question about comparing angularsj and reactjs ? which is the best ? 
solution: i discus with someone , he say no angular2 is nothing. Rebaiahmed: neither, they do and are different things, assuming you're talking about react's eco system. 

issue: BustyLoli-Chan: if you assign the value outside of ngAfterViewInit does it work? 
solution: so how do I do what I want... when my result comes back from my subscription my page doesn't change. 

issue: How can I see the current dependency package versions for angular 2? i.e. zone.js etc 
solution: you should just be able to use ^ and let npm worry about it. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: goto1: yep what I was saying. I've suffered that too, when you import modules with routes the route's order iskinda random. I just set all my routes on the same place now and have a//TODO look into modules and routes orderbut never did :)So I don't know if this has evolved. 

issue: where all do I need to importBrowserModuleandCommonModule?  I thought maybe just in myCoreModulebut it appears I may need it everywhere 
solution: They use react around.. on mobile apps also. Also Netflix is using react for they TV apps.. 

issue: then we'd have browoser imported for people working on libs? 
solution: in fact the question beingWhy platformbrowser imports commonmodule?It does not import CommonModule just exports it. That is the problem. I can't not get rid of common in favour of my lifted implementation. 

issue: how else does the browser render anything? 
solution: I guess what I mean is why is it looking for my index.html file in my angular app directory? Right now I serve index.html from a completely separate location.. I mean, reasonable place to look, but... I want it to specify it to have a different location.. it uses the one in the directory as as template, it inserts the script tags then outputs it in whateevr dir you define as the output. 

issue: so does anyone see anything wrong with this code  [<-CODE->] 
solution: I have been carrying this error for weeks now.

issue: why is it saying your Module is a function? 
solution: 

issue: Why would you use an interface, instead of just creating a class here? [<-LINK->] 
solution: i guess my point is, if the interface changes, there's no compiler errors. You have to remember to update the FormGroup demonstrated in that blog post, yourself. You also have to remember to change the view. Instead of just changing the class and getting compiler errors that the property name doesn't exist anymore. @scionwest you would have to create and assign the values to the class. When you get the values it is an object {key1: value1, key2:value2 ...} You don't need the extra overhead of assigning the values to a class. You already have the values. [<-CODE->] and in your class you have a property mydata: mydatainterface;And you get your type.And yes you have to make sure your template, formGroup and Interface correspond. This is the fussy part about forms.. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: do u have a repro of the same code but without angular? 
solution: 2nd plnkr link. you're right and it seems to be a rxjs bug.

issue: plunkr 
solution: 

issue: Because the module defines how the component's template will be interpreted,@AaronHood. So when we codegen code for the component,<foo-date-picker>in the template can only have one meaning. Which is determined by the module. 
solution: is he going to say "Please consider moving ClientCreateComponent to a higher module that imports AppraisalModule and ClientModule. You can also create a new NgModule that exports and includes ClientCreateComponent then import that NgModule in AppraisalModule and ClientModule"?. 

issue: if i wanna filter the values from an obs should i switchMap into an obs that filters? 
solution: if you want to filter, usefilter. I can see it now, age discrimination :). lazarljubenovic: ill be more explicit [<-CODE->]. i wantthis.notifications$to filter asynchronously. 

issue: pls kick him lol I'm not a stripper :c 
solution: 

issue: is there a way to render html into an existing component without using innerHtml? 
solution: if there was mute feature in gitter, Dz wouldn't see a single message. ever.. 

issue: i set client to null in my client-create but client isn't syncing with my parent component? 
solution: two separate vars? or just make client an output instead of input?. make an output, update it in the parent. 

issue: canvas is like, the least fun API in the history of APIs 
solution: 

issue: greetings earthlings!  is it appropriate to post angular2 jobs here? 
solution: sdebaun: , the Angular Community Code of Conduct applies here ( [<-LINK->] ) but it doesn't give guidelines about job postings.. 

issue: Is it possible to have angular2 serve its files from aws cloudfront? 
solution: Toxicable: CD = change detection, and you're saying that opening / closing the accordion might trigger CD?.

issue: I don't get it. How do I mock an Input field in a component? 
solution: ghetolay: but i create my components in a html file with propertyX=prop. 

issue: can i somehow run router CanActivate guards in series? Next one only after previous successfuly resolves 
solution: first i need to check user logged in/roles righs, then request some data  before component loading. Both requests can fail and cancel navigation. 

issue: Template outlets are just wrappers around theViewContainerRef.createEmbeddedViewAPI. 
solution: In one instance I have an accordion that is supposed to hold the data when it arrives. If I close and then open the accordion the data is there... I don't believe there has been a code change to cause the issue?. 

issue: they not provide some callback? 
solution: i get from the backend a paymenturl. i need to open the paymenturl. and the process will be there. but i need to capture popup events to know if the user cancel the process, o was done. 

issue: What is the nowcorrectway to pass a variable to a child component? 
solution: Some old stuff online is no longer thecorrectway, so just checking this was still right. 

issue: Hi! Can I use template variables in click method? eg [<-CODE->] 
solution: pawelkondraciuk: ... because "dropdown.open()" in <button (click)="dropdown.open()">Button</button> is still an expression?.

solution: march 2k17. 

issue: What's xhr got to do with window.location? 
solution: So you're making a request at your current URL to get the display-name header?. this is being done to intergrate with an enterprise authentication server that acts as a proxy. This ng2 app is running behind that proxy. 

issue: They're supposed to be merged. 
solution: initial spec said they won't and it wasn't so long ago :). he says merging would break users but i don't see anything in breaking changes since version inheritence got supported. 

issue: Is there a clever way to inject<script>into a template? 
solution: 

issue: How to get validators on a FormControl? 
solution: masaanli: you mean custom validation for a certain controller? you have to use form builder in that case. And in new FormControl('', [ <your_validation>]);. in that callback you ll get the control state and and you can return null if you accept that value or return a object with errors. 

issue: @DzmitryShylovich   January 18, 2017 5:42 PMlol what's this? 
solution: 

issue: josephliccini: you have to import it into the module that you are trying to use it in 
solution: nvm. FML spent like 30 minutes on this lol. 

issue: what's usually wrong when we want to change an@Inputvalue insidengOnchanges? 
solution: I need to modify an@Inputbase on another@Input, but this triggers the 'changed after checked error'.But I don't know how to do it differently. 

issue: Hi! In Angular 2 possible to create a multi root modules? 
solution: 

issue: This week I used for the first time preact as a jquery replacement :) and is a powerful combination. 
solution: jordic: it took me 4 months to get up to speed with ng2... biggest mistake was to believe a beta was a beta and a rc was an rc where both were actually just alphas but now it's fantastic. I planned to mix jQuery with ng2 while converting an existing application but just the other day I removed jQuery from the dependencies. Almost everything is more elegant.. 

issue: So I know why I'm having an error and usingsetTimeout()would solve the problem but should I rather question my design ? [<-LINK->] 
solution: to be more precise I havelayoutandactivePageso I need to changeactivePageto go from page 1 to 2 for examplebut when you change thelayout,activePagewill change according to thelayout. 

issue: is there a way to call something likeencodeURIComponentfrom a template?

issue: masaanli: well post your code we're not wizards 
solution: lazarljubenovic: is not a wizard. CamusAran: you're giving it a number. 1 is 1 millisecond after 1 jan 1970. it was probably thursday. 

issue: and why? 
solution: 

issue: make a plnkr 
solution: martinop: - try to print the chosen value after select and before. For me it happend when the selected value was the object, and the initial value I set was the object id, or vice versa. Just a guess though.. 

issue: btw, would material and bootstrap4 be seen as alternatives or are they complementary? 
solution: coderishu: use the router? check angular.io docs on router tutorial. 

issue: i've yet to find a way to hook into the httpRequest loading update event too for a more accurate loading bar

solution: 

issue: chaiwa-berian: @CoderCat84would you help? 
solution: chaiwa-berian: You're probably on the wrong level of routing. chaiwa-berian: I actually don't know much about routing, most of my SPA apps don't have multiple routes so I haven't done much with it. 

issue: why whats the issue? i used it only once 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys I 'm with this problem! No provider for ActivatedRouteSnapshot but I'm make router 
solution: So my main example is services that need to hit a certain endpoint.  And the endpoint is different for each environment (int, QA, prod, etc.). 

issue: I have some stuff that I need to complete before any pages load, is there any way to delay loading of routes until it's done? 
solution: I might just need to exposed an initialized BehaviorSubject that starts as false and gets set to true when all initialization is done.. then pages can do what they want with it. 

issue: what does npm start do? 
solution: It manages dependencies. owlstack: let's get back to original problem.

issue: Hi, made a project using angular cli, on npm start node is unable to find index.html file, can someone help how can I resolve this? 
solution: 

issue: I have this code [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: virusakos_twitter: why are you making a function for a single line!. MurhafSousli: trying to be proactive in case I need to do more in the future. virusakos_twitter: this is good if you have multiple functions which use the same code, but if this is not the case you better go with [<-CODE->]. 

issue: Please guide me "how to upload file in angular 2  to Nodejs" ? 
solution: 14Muhammad: you can send files with Angular's Http Module and FormData which will make it multipart. Toxicable: :: I can't able to do it with HTTP.Please share link of some demo if you have ..Thanks in advance.. in that example it will grab the file from the native ele then upload it as FormData. 

issue: I don't think you can add directives dynamically 
solution: stephanjust: I am trying to group up the options (creating dynamic options ) for one of my app. when i use ngModelGroup the form value not updates after deleting a option,  but when you toggle using the hide and show it works fine.. 

issue: hey guys, what is the difference between [routerLink]=... vs routerLink=, with brackets vs without? 
solution: AlexZan: If you want yourrouterLinkcoming from a variable bind it[routerLink]="variable", but it seems you\'ve got it... ;).

issue: file an issue in material repo? :) 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: you could add some intellectual weight to this ;) [<-LINK->]. 

issue: What is the "why" for no v3? That\'s something I never looked up. :-P I'm guessing that's the link? 
solution: 

issue: How about coordinates validator? 
solution: Yeah. noted down. 

issue: So anyone have any idea about my unit testing question? :D 
solution: 

issue: <input (blur)="myControl.updateValueAndValidity()">? 
solution: pmulac: I\'m saying if I haveformControlNameapplied to the input, that is inherently keeping the value of the input in-sync with the "model" of the form, so having(blur)="myControl.updateValueAndValidity()"wouldn\'t really be doing anything useful would it? I\'m basically trying to have view->model changes only occur on blur, but model->view changes still need to occur as they happen. 

issue: Oooph. So I narrowed down my previous Firebase issue to the smallest scope I can... and I'm at a loss. Is there something special about 'some' event listener callbacks that prevents Angular/ReactiveX from seeing changes that are initiated within them? Even though I have a behaviorSubject calling next(updatedData), no update will occur until a heartbeat 'window.setInterval' ticks over. Even if there is literally no code within the interval's callback.  ( [<-LINK->] ) 
solution: 

issue: Shouldn'tNo provider for TabsetComponent!be a message about a failing DI? 
solution: Toxicable: TabsetComponent is a component of a 3rd party lib that works fine in most parts of my application. We have an alternative module for a special touch device that imports the same shared module as the normal webclient (shared module contains the tab module). There's not a single reference towards tabs/tabsetcomponent in the touch module, yet this throws. It's driving me crazy :/. 

issue: do you guys know how to dorouter.initialNavigation()with preserving query parameters? 
solution: well, we have a referral id on a query param, which we need to extract and do some logic depending on where the user came from (i.e. they just signed up, etc.).router.initialNavigation()is removing all query params.. 

issue: Bug Validators.minLength() number?Does not validate 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys! I started using the observer instead promises and I have question: Is it good solution? [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: ehm the output is the same as object 2 
solution: piercers: In fact I think my reducer is not split enough and I'm trying to handle a merge / add / remove into one method and it's just stupid. I should rather split'em all. 

issue: @lazarljubenovicemo musicany recommendations? 
solution: tokyo hotel. Emo /imo/ is a loosely categorized rock music genre characterized by expressive, often confessional, lyrics.. 

issue: What's kinda weird header is that That ain't JSON 
solution: geeky77_twitter: well I mean for it to be able to parse into json it should be application/JSON but it depends on your server. geeky77_twitter: ... it seems that it is related to something as server-side JsonP - ExtJS is using something as JsonP proxy.. 

issue: what framework? 
solution: #startsFlameWar. don't show us your stupidity :). 

issue: Hi Guys, i need to access Angular 2 (installed on the server ) from local system. 
solution: localhost:4200 is the url but how can this be accessed from a outside the installed system which has https access..

issue: how do make an ngIf  route = some path? 
solution: ylandau:  [<-LINK->]. YeomansIII: i want to get the active route from other components, not the child. Not sure what you mean, but you can always get the full location with theWindow.locationjs object [<-LINK->]. 

issue: I'm trying to add an extension to RxJS that is initialized in an Angular service.. this code almost works but not quite [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: ryanlangton: create a new instance operator that does your tracing whenever it is subscribed to. ( [<-LINK->] ). You will have to use Observable.create in order to take an action only once at subscription time.. 

issue: Anyone else getting a cert error for angular.io? 
solution: Attackers might be trying to steal your information from angular.io. 

issue: Hi guys! How to do this with interval please? [<-CODE->] 
solution: alxhub: I want to remove .subscribe() from my component and use| asnyc. 

issue: Woo :D 
solution: 

issue: why do you have html as an extension? 
solution: 

issue: and what's the actual question? there's 10 files there what do i look at 
solution: it's just input + output with sugar on top. 

issue: should we throw/warn if custom trackBy returns undefined? 
solution: i've written a trackby by returningitem.idand there was no.idin the object ever :). 

issue:  [<-CODE->] this doesn't get invoked for/support/1234, does it? 
solution: achimha: I believe it would since1234is a child ofsupport. 

issue: I need help with an error: "TypeError: e is not a function at [<-LINK->] " any suggestions? 
solution: 

issue: I upgraded from angular 2.4.5 to 4.0.0-beta.4 now my app is broken 
solution: it says that RouterModule is undefined. angular: /router is properly loaded. 

issue: (ngModel)='variable'this won't work afaik 
solution: but yeah on the second thought it definitelly won't. i wonder if parser allows for@Input() a; @Output('a') b;. 

issue: there is noelsefor*ngIf, is there or will there be? 
solution: achimha: actually there is now. pls not again those astronauts.... DzmitryShylovich: This is my last question about it....

solution: 

issue: Are any questions in here related to Angular? 
solution: they\'re generally called "badges". 

issue: hellu, yes this is me I made that account earlier today to use as a bot account 
solution: so im trying out using it for a bit and hopefully it dosen't get banned again. so far, I am able to create a login form, call the api and validate the login and using guards for authenticaiton to go to dashboard component.. 

issue: how do i apply a structural directive on content passed through ngTemplateOutlet? 
solution: 

issue: And welcome to Angular 2 everybody... :/ 
solution: JonForest: it's teenage hormones apparently :). A whole chunk of the community just got up and left. Kind of need an Angular2 - random channel tbh. 

issue: I've never used twitter, can you just like ask them questions? 
solution: in the worst case they will ban your twitter acc :). robwormald: also looks like your method will work fine, investigated it a bit more and it looks like the params are always in the fragment of the url so I can just split on#:D thanks. I don't get how other people have made bots for it if they jsut get banned within 12 hrs or so.

issue: Hey everyone! Is there any server rendering library  for apache or nginx since my backend is wordpress? 
solution: So google can crawl my angular2 site but copy-pasted links won't be rendered (eg. Facebook, LinkedIn etc.), is that what it means? Does it affect SEO from google crawler's perspective?@AngieTheBot. 

issue: is there a better way to do this? [<-CODE->] 
solution: As you can see by that example you have 2 lines with lots of logic about convering the call and awaiting and mapping where as the way I showed above, I was able to do it in 1 line with the use of a single operator.. 

issue: Which a best UI framework to use with angular2 ? for desktop and mobile app 
solution: 

issue: Angular2 quickstart come with Bootstrap? www.getbootstrap.comwhat 
solution: i usually pin it if i want to be notified and then forget that it exists until im pinged. 

issue: does@ngrxhave something similar for ng1? 
solution: you could probably use normal redux though. I'd like to keep rx as a workflow if possible. Not that im familiar with the AngularJS ecosystem atm, but I don't think someone has made one. 

issue: how's the ng group today?  Feeling good and going to tackle an error that has been a pain in my side 
solution: alxhub: the craziest thing is if I let it error I can refresh the page and be logged in.  but if i put it in a try/catch it won't login at all... POS lol. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: CamusAran: one thing to note is, when a formcontrol is disabled and u check formGroup.value, the disabled control's value wont be there. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] is there an angular-y way to do this? then im good thanks 
solution: yeah Dzmitry, a provider.

issue: i am not able to get http response with .map  .. does it need .subscribe always?? 
solution: 

issue: Is tehre any way to detect if all resources(http, api calls, timeouts ets) associated with a components are finished? 
solution: Toxicable: it is probably pretty complex thing to implement and it might be quite resourcefull task to run. just to simplify my spinner implementation and to reduce the codesmell related to this one. 

issue: Matmo10: yep, exactly. 
solution: Though you probably want to useObservable.timerorObservable.intervalinstead ofsetTimeoutdirectly.. alxhub: so when the app boots it replaces the rendered template and starts running. 

issue: How does one@Inputhave multiple states? 
solution: alxhub: That input's state changes. That should work then. But yeah. Having multipleLoadingStates for multiple things loading makes sense.. 

issue: how do I properly unsubscribe from an observable in a service? is there something like lifecycle hooks for injectables? 
solution: 

issue: Hey, is there a CDN for the angular components?

solution: owlstack: import {CookieOptionsArgs} from 'angular2-cookie/core';. 

issue: Does anybody no whymodel.searchTextdoes not update when typing in this input? It triggers it when the cursor is moved though; [<-CODE->] 
solution: trisman: Reason this through. Your state.select() gives you an observable of the state. On a change of that state you want to increment or decrement a local property. this.state.select('loading).subscribe(value => {you have the state value here}. within the subscription block increment or decrement this.loaders, and use that in your template {{loaders}}.

solution: so we were benchmarking against infernoJS here, i think that's what tobias got inspired/challenged by:. Nontheless,@robwormaldI'm excited that the core team is looking at these things. 

issue: Yeah that's what i've noticed, the Core API is basically solid, most problems i've seen are related to tooling or 3rd party libs 
solution: 

issue: I would recommend pushing back against boilerplate i dont know what this means, at all. 
solution: robwormald: It means that you should try to reduce how much code is necessary to get up and running instead of getting users to use a scaffolding tool. 

issue: But@robwormaldis there somewhere we can follow the progress on this view engine? 
solution: i probably shoulnd\'t even be showing you the comparison, as we don\'t really "compete" in that sense. 

issue: anyone can help me? try to access "screen" and "window" object, but error catched: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: how do you get data with json? 
solution: 

issue: How can I satisfy true/false forcanActivate()guard when I'm returning a value? 
solution: yes I had that before.  unfortunately i am using universal and need to return the key value from my authService. is there a way to wait for authService.getToken() to receive token, and then return true?  I'm still new to rxjs. 

issue: but what I don't understand is if a component cannot live without a module.. why shouldn't it know about the module? can a component live without a module and can be loaded? 
solution: It's just like when you have a Component that is called from inside another Component. That component belongs to the Shared Module but it's being called from inside one of the Modules that imported the Shared Module, then who does it belong to?. 

issue: Hey quick question, is there a way to selectively render a component's@ContentChildren? 
solution: i guess it is a tabs component, but it only displays as tabs when the browser width is very small. otherwise it would show things side by side. 

issue: How do I debounce ngOnChanges? 
solution: CamusAran: I will Google that for you for a dollar. 

issue: how is my a prefix ? 
solution: 

issue: Hi 
solution: i have to show two view before login and after login. but i don't want to change url. 

issue: what is jsonp? 
solution: someone other than@DzmitryShylovich;). maybe I googled and it said this was the best place to ever get answers?. 

issue: can we pass a string to the constructor of an AuthGuard? 
solution: NileshGokhale: or factory  provider. 

issue: why not wait for final? 
solution: as much as I like new features things like Universal isn't done yet. 

issue: How i can inject a service dynamically? inside a component 
solution: 

issue: Hey, what's up 
solution: 

issue: Afternoon 
solution: 

issue: what is angular animation going to do? 
solution: 

issue: hi, is there any rich text editor for angular 2 ? 
solution: Toxicable: no i was looking for a  HTML rich text editor control in angular 2 is there any?. 

issue: most? are u kidding? :) 
solution: I heard the other day that according to their stats the Cli is used by a rather large majority. 

issue: takeUntilhelps clean up uglyunsubscribes imo 
solution: when you call .subscribe on something, you're managing it yourself :D. So I have memory leaks by leaving that.. 

issue: how i could do a dynamic import of service? 
solution: Martin_Ocando_twitter: ... because a standard way is to have a service as a singleton. You can instantiate a service in any point and time but you have to count with a scope for which it is valid.. mlc-mlapis: the problem is im using server side render but I have libs that only works on the browser then I have a isBrowser or isNode condition to now the enviroment.. i need to import the TranslateService only if isBrowser. 

issue: Hi Guys, [<-CODE->] 
solution: karthickthangasamy: in fact, you can add as many click handlers to an element as you want. 1, 2, or 10. 

issue: I need use "" instead of \'\' like \'""\' but how do I escape the "" 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] if anybody has a little spare time :) i’d appreciate ideas/help 
solution: 

issue: Do I need to declare a provider in my component again even though it's been added to the providers list when bootstrapping? 
solution: nakedsushi: don't use the providers array of@Component. Why not? Is it always better to add your providers during bootstrapping? I can see a case where you just want a handful of components to use a provider instead of all of them, but in my case, a lot of my components would be using it.. 

issue: is it possible to convert an elementRef to a ViewContainer? 
solution: I have a few elements I created with renderer.createElement(), and between those I want to put a component dynamically. 

issue: Omg my PR got merged in 
solution: You didn’t add a semicolon did you? :P   I always lol when people do that. FrozenPandaz: it will break somebodys code and people will blame you :). ill shave them a byte or 2.... 

issue:  [<-LINK->] CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA doesn't work? 
solution: 

issue: brain loss 
solution: it is really weird, the list is updated. but it seems the child-component to which I pass the list as input with [list]="list" is then not rendered correctly really weird. 

issue: So you are doing a fetch to get an app config? 
solution: i think thats what you want. and then you can use a platform to bootstrap that. 

issue: As a matter of interest do you guys use Model or Template Driven forms? 
solution: 

issue: I have an observable were at some point I make a huge computation.I can subscribe to this observable multiple times and I\'d like to "share" what\'s after the big computation. How can I do that ? 
solution: I've recently started heavily looking at GraphQL so I'm also in there though it's not active. I think it needs more community around it. I'm surprised it hasn't gained more traction by now.. 

issue: how does your code look like now? 
solution: ericmartinezr: same treatment to my product component, but it still has its ProductService as provider. Lhari: no man, sorry. Not sure you can reproduce it in a plnkr, if you can it would be nice. 

issue: it's your own wrapper around window so u can mock it in unit tests... 
solution: 

issue: how do we work with hammerjs ? 
solution: well I mean. like it's gonna loook exactly the same. 

issue: apparently, everytime I create a new component in my module I need to restart ng serve 
solution: 

issue: Have you reached out to React to see how they might ... react? ;) 
solution: Definitely not. Just attribute it and move on... or do all the changes you proposed.. 

issue: is pipe for money built in? 
solution: you guys need to fix currency pipe, or explain how to use it.. I don't want USD in front of the number. foxjazz:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: How to remove an element usingRenderer? 
solution: Toxicable: I need to remove an element. so after onLoad complete I remove the tag.. no template interaction. 

issue: Someone use Sass with Angular 2 ? 
solution: Indeed because I don't undersand how Angular CLI built the final style.css ... I have my styles.scss, mixins.scss, classes.scss, variables.scss in the folder assets/css of my app, but how I can use it on a component style ? Because theese styles are scoped of his own components and I haven't access to variables.scss from a component styles scss file.... 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys, Whats the equivalent of $cacheFactory in angular 2? 
solution: I wanted to store some results in a service using cachefactory, any idea on how to do this in ng2?. rajdeep26: cachefactory on angularjs was builded for storing templates. On angular2 you can do it with a prop in the service... 

issue: Angular dosent support TS 2.2 2.1* 
solution: probably not using ng4.x. 

issue: istiti:  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: Any way I can fix this while still keeping the structure I'd like to have ? 
solution: 

issue: How often should one run an update in a project? I guess whenever you have time to test the update(s)? 
solution: 

issue: Is ng conf worth it? 
solution: No matter what you're able to do Angular 2.x still dostn support ts2.1. owlstack: if you are from us - maybe. owlstack: it's sold out if you were thinking of going. 

issue: How i can set in app.component router-outlet? I get: ORIGINAL EXCEPTION: No provider for RouterOutletMap! 
solution: so I was looking a way that once api data is patched to nested form builder object I wanted to change one value in nested object to date type. I belive I need to do it in object before I use patch Value.. lazarljubenovic: @derekkiteso even at run time if I wish to change some property of nested formBuilder object , we need to bind object only? We can't set or patch to single key in nested builder form group is what I understand.. jayeshanandani: you can setValue or patchValue to any individual formcontrol in your tree.  the form interface is only for data. Beyond that you need component or view level access. If you have one component that requires some special data mangling, then wrap that component. Here is an example [<-LINK->]. 

issue: can anyone tell help me checking why some very simple code that works in js doesn't work in Angular? 
solution: I have some code that counts the elements that are not empty in an array in js: [<-LINK->]. When I pass the same formula to angular, it doesn't work. Keeps counting empty elements for some reason: [<-LINK->]. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] github toolbar 
solution: you're stealing other people's tweets again :(. yes. 

issue: hi is this channel dead? 
solution: 

issue: what's this ngvikings? 
solution: girlshttp://prntscr.com/e7avk0. you said something about leaving?. you can come back after a couple of days. you've been warned. repeatedly.. 

issue: I want to know about the $apply Please, help on this. 
solution: massabd: this may help [<-LINK->]. massabd: $apply dosen't exist in Angular. This is the Angular channel, please see [<-LINK->] For AngularJS. 

issue: good afternoon. I think everyone has behaved so far :) thanks for that by the way robwormald: 
solution: derekkite: i get emails about it when it happens. sometimes from my boss, who probably got an email too.. 

issue: Tonight? more like afternoon Pretty good thank you Putting in some async validators 
solution: Imo, they should be truly async, and allow the state to change over time. makes sense I guess, there are a few other things in forms that need some work aswell. 

issue: I was just wondering.... what is the size of angular 2.4.x ? when i googled it... it shows for beta (761k) just asking? 
solution: 

issue: So screenreaders too? Don't know if those have js 
solution: You could technically use universal to mimic the behavior of mustache or handlebars, but I don't think I would pick universal if I didn't intend to build a client side counterpart to the server side part.. 

issue: any pointers on the RxJS above? 
solution: rightisleft: that's becasue this.subscription hasn't been assigned yet. rightisleft: not answering your question,  but you may find this interesting [<-LINK->]. i only want that method to execute successfully once. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Use an observable? 
solution: this.tasks = this.service.tasks$, in the service push to the observable when you get the data back from the http request. mlc-mlapis: it works !Is this a nice way to work or is this considered "ugly" ?. 

issue: is there an ng2 equivalent towindow.history.pushState? 
solution: I have a map component and whenever the user pans, I want to update the URL with the coordinates so you get a shareable link. achimba: use router.navigate(['.',{'point: point}]). 

issue: what version of the cli should I be using?  their versioning is a bit confusing 
solution: 

issue: FrozenPandaz: are you here? 
solution: 

issue: Hi All,  Im trying to reference a component by name without having to import that component into my class.  For example I want to get a reference to ComponentA, but without having to define import {ComponentA} from...Is this possible ? 
solution: 

issue: Any news about 4.0? 
solution: CamusAran: RC should be this week.. 

issue: Actually Search Crawlers run JS now 
solution: FrozenPandaz: Still. My experience is that sites that run http request during load don't fare well with crawlers. You may get the landing page indexed, but without data since the crawlers didn't successfully execute the JS based http call. 

issue: what is the better lib for cache? 
solution: Martin_Ocando_twitter: better than what?. 

issue: anyone know how compress images in angular 2? 
solution: Ups. martinop: sounds more like a job for your packager than angular :P. 

issue: I get aCan't resolve all parameters for HeaderRendererComponent: (?, [object Object]).error message, but the missing component is declared in the same module, and setting a breakpoint before the crash shows that it is at least already in the directiveCache  of the CompileMetadataResolve. Anyone an idea on how to debug the cause for that? :/ 
solution: @alvipeo when you create a new action of that type, and pass it a parameter in the constructor, how does it know where to put the data? You could do [<-CODE->] and the class would look like {type: whatever, payload: datapassed}Or you could do [<-CODE->] But why in the world would you want to?. 

issue: Hello! New to ng2, i am using the cli and everytime I use it to create a component it also adds it to the app.module.ts declarations array. Do I have to do that for every single component? Nope, Guess i just want to know more about it 
solution: 

issue: I was wondering: Is it considered bad style to use setTimeout to wait for the changeDetection cycle (or in my case the reactive form to register the change) before callingupdateValueAndValidityfor another control? 
solution: ghetolay: I have a form with a Control (lets call it "length-field") to input an amount and a FormArray. Using a custom validator I check that the array has fewer items than given in the length-fild. But to update the validation I callupdateValueAndValidityinside a valueChange listener on the length-field. Without the setTimeout I still have the old value inside the Validator.. 

issue: Can you not do this? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: This has been proposed before, quite sure if you search for it you can find a lot 
solution: For now just inject the parent component or a shared service in the child. 

issue: can you do this in the app component and once the value of token != null then proceed? 
solution: ScaryWolfMan: After you get the response back for key can't you just navigate to where you need to go?. 

issue: ScaryWolfMan: ... why this duplicity in app component? 
solution: just storing it in both while i test.. 

issue: The dynamic module loading thing? 
solution: Well it was just a proof of concept thing. The idea was to make a system that allows you to be able to Dynamically load in NgFactories that have been bundled seprately from the main app. As a replacement for all those apps that store their HTML in DB's they could store these NgFactories instead. Which that they'd be able to use AOT 100% fine and have as dynamic content was they want. 

issue: Module cms? 
solution: Yeah I guess that would be 1 use case for it. I don't know much about how CMS's work though and it still dosent make sense to do it like this but _(ツ)_/. Miko Hevery mentioned "CMS" as a "thing that could be in angular 5", don\'t know if it\'s relevant or if there\'s any more info on it. 

issue: is there a way to use ngFor without an iterable object, but just to run for a number of times? Like a regular for loop? 
solution: HauntedSmores: a custom directive should be easy enough otherwise. Was about to share it but then I remembered I ended up to not doing it :). 

issue: I am moving from Java and .Net on the backend too looking at Node with an Angular 2 front end. Since I am planning on using the Angular CLI, Webpack package. Has anyone integrated this template with the server side, connect to a database and provide a descent example? instead of having the ngFor on its own element, have you placed it as a attribute on the other elements? So it is not in the resulting DOM structure which interferes with the CSS 
solution: 

issue: well i want to determine current route in service. any ideas? 
solution: dklmuc: I dont like this. Its not components responsibility to know current route.. 

issue: What are you talking about? Template for loops? 
solution: if you need the idx multiple time it can be a bit annoying. 

issue: Any body have idea why we have to import same service into module and in component 
solution: broweratcognitecdotcom: because it's dynamic, the user of componentA is supposed to be able to specify additional componentCs that appear inside componentB. 

issue: How about*forLoop="let idx from 1 to 5? 
solution: You could have abyvalue too.. ^ that's a reasonable point for when you don't want to doposition: {{ idx + 1}}. 

issue: I have a doubtAngular 2 is not working on iphone 
solution: I open the page in chrome or iphone safari and it does not work at all well. 

issue: question about using Modernizr in Angular 2. I downloaded the js file and included it in my index.html. I am not importing it into my component. Able to test the Modernizr.adownload property. However, getting a build error --> TS2304: Cannot find name 'Modernizr'. 
solution: 

issue: Does firebase have relational databases btw? 
solution: CamusAran: You can use indirect pagination. It means that you will be filling your internal cache from a server and through observable inform about changes which should be displayed in a view.. 

issue: can I get support for 1.5 in here 
solution: not in here. is there a gitter for it. another room for AngularJS. thx. 

issue: Is it possible to lazy load a module without using the router? 
solution: cgatian: It depends on your knowledge.. The complex part is setting up your build system to produce a bundle to be loaded.. 

issue: startWith(null)on the first stream ? 
solution: In fact I'd like something like that : [<-CODE->]. ghetolay: I took a look into startWith but I don't think it's what I want. Because I also want to emit when the first emits. 

issue: Can anyone explain any benefits of using map on an Observable and doing logic vs subscribing first and doing logic on the subscription output? 
solution: I've seen a lot of articles advocating keeping everything as an Observable stream and working on it via map and using the async pipe in the template. But are there actually any real benefits?. 

issue: guys here is a rough outer view of I am tryin to achieve(may be my drawing is not that good) but in the view I have a static components for the links except one,  so how I achieve it any guidelines?? link--> [<-LINK->] 
solution: I am like in my home link I want the toolbar, the side component and the view, but in the other links there are some static components so how I hav to route I am not gettin.. like consider the page to be dashboard ,, my route by default wil be dashboard/home; after that when I route to page 1 i.e dashboard/page1 I want to have some static components to be induced in all the links after this say page1,page2 and so on but the route being only dashboard/page1 or dashboard/page2 and so on....@Toxicable. 

issue: alxhub: how can I specify the right paths in index.html? 
solution: So it'll work on s3 or locally as a build without node server?. 

issue: same for me since 1.9 
solution: 

issue: is BehaviourSubject not a reasonable replacement for an array? 
solution: you end up writing a lot of boilerplate code to retrieve the object from the sbject, update it, and next() it. for not much practical benefit.. I personally do often use BehaviourSubject but then im also using Firebase so I use that as  my "Store". 

issue:  [<-LINK->] Good morning, Angular people! 
solution: 

issue: it can very well be because of the asynchronousity of console.log, but honnestly I doubt it. This would do the same [<-CODE->] but it does not And actually neither does your code 
solution: 

issue: what's this forwardRef magic doing here?  [<-CODE->] 
solution: it implements RootNode as an interface, but it also provides a RootNode class as an injectable argument? it's not defined in the constructor. 

issue: anyone know why Angular Material would put/** @deprecated */onMaterialModule.forRoot()? 
solution: derekkite: Yeah. One of our contractors took it upon himself to update the app at the suggestion of our UX designer.  The contractor went through our app and made themdtomatchanges. But I think it was a half baked change our contractor did.. 

issue: ngrx gives you a canonical, tested pattern for what you're doing in an ad-hoc fashion right now 
solution: yeah same answer from a salesman. (or redux, for that matter). 

issue: Right, so I am basically trying to force my current implementation into doing something it’s not really designed to do? 
solution: So probably should go checkout ngrx for this. 

issue: what is best way to save the "store\'s state" when user navigates away from the app and returns? 
solution: that means every change to the state has to be sync'd i guess. You could save to localStorage or indexedDB but then you would save state across devices. 

issue: isn't that label likegotoin other languages? 
solution: It kinda is. But it's for breaks and continues I believe. 

issue: How does it work? 
solution: 

issue: How would I stop it when there are no subscribers? 
solution: 

issue: Can anyone recommend a lightweight package for showing human diff between dates? Or reading material for rolling your own 
solution: I just need a few diff functions so looks like using date-fns will produce the smallest size?. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] String Filter Pipe [<-CODE->] Study Module [<-CODE->] I’ve been following ng2-pagination as an example, since I’m trying to replicate the filtering in the advanced example. 
solution: jdaltonchilders: the last time I used a pipe example from somewhere I got an exception on the first run because it didn't check for corner cases. What data are you piping? I'd look at that.. I’m attempt to type in the name of the study or something in the table and filter based on that.. 

issue: Is there an Angular 2 alternative forfill-layoutfrom the AngularJS materials? 
solution: milanvdmria: i think you can just make a style,.fill {display: flex; flex: 1 1 auto}that would accomplish the same thing. 

issue: This feels a bit off to me 
solution: you're not using onpush or anything, so assigning it should be 100% fine. If you guys are talking about the plnkr above, you should comment the subscription in the constructor and uncomment the "this.getArticle();" line. 

issue: In your opinion the best place to cash data in angular2 is? CookieStorage? 
solution: 

issue: so my service should have a subject? 
solution: but have anyone done sth like that? using subject to observe var/object changes?. 

issue: Hi guys, is there API to set a radio button input in reactive froms programmaticaly? 
solution: so I want to set the radio button selection from the API. in other words, is there a way to set AbstractControl  to 'SELECTED'. 

issue: sorting html!? 
solution: Toxicable: I believe that :). 

issue: Hey guys, when I have anActivatedRouteSnapshot, how can I obtain the full URL for the route? 
solution: eXXeption: yeah but when my route has children it only returns the first parent route. ukaaa: @ghetolayseems if ur using RouterStateSnapshot.url instead of ActivatedRouteSnapshot.url you will get the full URL as a string. that is way easier. 

issue: have an idea how can I make recursive directive ? 
solution: SkyNetDZ: You can build trees using components, I don't see how a directive could help there.. 

issue: what's ngrx ? 
solution: 

issue: Is it at all possible to get the size of the parent container a child component is in ? 
solution: mancart: there are other ways to do it, but that seems like the right one. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: derekkite: it is what I am doing right now and it is interfering with aclickevent.  [<-LINK->]. yeah that is double click. 

issue: Is there any tools for styling Angular components ? 
solution: SkyNetDZ: Yes, I understand what you mean. MD is the way from Google side. There are also other authors of native UI components like PrimeNG, ngx-ui, Kendo UI, to mention only some of them. But it is also related to the timeline, when Angular 2 was released. I mean that the situation will different in 6 months.. 

issue: Hi. Did anyone know of one seed project that has everything set up for BDD, or some BDD examples? 
solution: LeonardCModoran_twitter: Depends on what u're looking for I guess. Jasmine (which is a BDD framework) is included in quiet alot starters iirc. Maybe there are  other/better alternatives to jasmine from a BDD perspective, but I think jasmine is commonly used with the starters.. 

issue: can <div onresize="myFunction" > </div> Still be used in Angular? "onresize" 
solution: 

issue: Good morning :) 
solution: Sadly I won't make it this year :/. 

issue: Angular registers all startup module providers with the application root injector.Angular adds certain components to entry components automatically. Components listed in @NgModule.bootstrap are added automatically. Components referenced in router configuration are added automatically. These two mechanisms account for almost all entry components. 
solution: When the app starts, Angular eagerly loads the AppModule and the ContactModule.Both instances of the imported SharedModule would provide the UserService. Angular registers one of them in the root app injector (see above). Then some component injects UserService, Angular finds it in the app root injector, and delivers the app-wide singleton UserService. No problem.. 

issue: Is there any links to why 4.0 has been tagged before 3.0?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: because the router was already at 3. so they wanted to sync it. Lewiscowles1986:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Hey there, how can I use 2 async validators on a single control?? 
solution: 

issue: hey anyone here how to provide target for internal nlog 
solution: 

issue: I'm getting aReferenceError: file_model_1 is not definedyet the compiler works fine. Any good ideas on how I can debug this ? 
solution: 

issue: is it ever better to use promises instead of observables? 
solution: 

issue: any idea why this doesn't do anything? [<-LINK->] 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: what is that random div solving? 
solution: Toxicable: it causes a click handler to be executed no matter where you click on the page. Toxicable:  [<-LINK->]. ohhh. 

issue: hi, how to add ionic plug in "uk.co.workingedge.phonegap.plugin.launchnavigator" in angular+meteor+Ionic2 app with meteor CLI? 
solution: istiti: , meteor supports adding ionic plug-ins. I tried various commands like meteor add ionic:uk.co.workingedge.phonegap.plugin.launchnavigator, but it is not working.. vltr: , I got it working using "meteor add cordova:uk.co.workingedge.phonegap.plugin.launchnavigator@3.2.1" command. thanks. 

issue: hey i want to destory an angular module but the problem is that NgModuleRef => destory function is deleting the html tag too but i want to keep it is there any solution ?? 
solution: joumenharzli: you contradicted yourself there, you said you want to destroy a component but you want the component to remain without a view?. i want to unload only the root module and not deleting the tag where that module will be boostraped let say that i have <root-component>Loading</root-component> i was able to destory it using destory function but it will remove the tag also. 

issue: are you using websocket? nodejs? 
solution: where is a good boilerplate for this. it works like a signal yes But you don't mean that ?. I think he meant to say signalR huh. 

issue: map instead of subscribe ? 
solution: where I sayreturn data;in the first if statement, that should be raw data, which it is if I console.logdataright before. I think you want filter rather than map even better. 

issue: Whats the most proper method of adding a class to dom from a directive. just looking for keywords. I'll do the research. 
solution: matthewharwood: I think [<-LINK->] recipe is what you need. Yeah the docs are good. I'm just looking for a suggested methods from good sources. I could def figure some bad way to do this.. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] is that normal? 
solution: they fire before the component has been instantiated. Toxicable: but even before the root component?@NgModule({ ..., bootstrap: [AppComponent] }). tsm91: I don't know how it works with root. 

issue: How to build when I use [<-LINK->] for development seed 
solution: 

issue: how do i make a logout() dat can be called on virtually every component? 
solution: jjoaoclaro: Using a service that you inject into each component that needs it.. i was thinking if there is a way to make it with router... like sending the page to a logout path. 

issue: Has anyone here used the renderer class? 
solution: I saw a post somewhere about assigning it to a function and the  when unlistening simply assigning that function to a blank function. 

issue: hi people do you advice best back end for angular 2 front end ? 
solution: No I mean, it's called Angular, not angular 2 as you called it. 

issue: for libs? should do es2015 for tree shaking 
solution: 

issue: how can I use a plnkr with ng4+? :c 
solution: 

issue: :'( 
solution: 

issue: is this something used readily? I feel like it goes against single responsibility 
solution: yeah but shouldnt you be handling states in individual services?. hungerregnuh: this is from v4 onwards, renderer  is deprecated and RendererV2 is the default Renderer from here on out. 

issue: how do i know that it works? it's barely code what is expected behaviour? 
solution: ndcunningham: erm when people sleep they tend to wake up after a while. otherwise they're probably dead. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] wait by what? 
solution: that is a fair point. it's a framework for mongodb I think. didn't even think :D. mongodb's orm. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] material use a directive for their tooltip if that's similar to what you want 
solution: although think i'll struggle w/ this a bit more, slowly getting an idea of what renderer can do. 

issue: can someone tell me how to set all formcontrols to dirty if i have only the reference of a formgroup? doesnt work 
solution:

solution: haha yeah man, closure is the hot topic of the moment. 

issue: it's a wrapper, and in an inheritance sense it's a child? 
solution: You've made a wrapper component, it wraps some content into a general template.. You're using that wrapper to create a bunch of specialized components that all share some general markup.. 

issue: I have a service with such constructor [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] how can I do that? 
solution: 

issue: I take it that my parent-most route isn't getting any notifications on its url or params .subscribe because it has no idea somehow what's going on for childRoutes underneath it? Is that supposed to be a thing? 
solution: Toxicable: Okay. So if the parent-most component needs to know what's going on in routes defined as forChild in modules... those modules declaring their forChild routes need to somehow subscribe and emit an event back to the parent-most component?.

solution: I solved it but I don't get why what I did solved it. My behavior subject is an object of type UserList. UserList has properties users: User[] and pages: number[]. My component had these properties instead of just having a UserList. I tried to set those properties of the component from the UserList passed to the subscription handler..

issue: Is there a way to validate nested form group? 
solution: I've noticed that providing an object withvalidatorkey executes the provided function giving FormControl as an argument..

issue: Somebody knows why suddenly my observable isnt working did they change something to the Github api? heres is my code [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: What is the best practice when using feature modules that require other feature modules ? Should globally used modules be imported in the root module alone or should they be included as dependency of the feature modules as well ? 
solution: crystalbyte:  [<-LINK->] The purpose behind an ngModule is a compilation context to produce bundles that can be loaded as needed throughout the application lifecycle. The structure becomes obvious if you think of it that way; some modules would be features, all the components needed to implement that feature. Common modules such as all your defined pipes and directives that every feature requires. Maybe two of your features require specific things, then a module containing them so other feature modules aren't bulking up. The style is defined by the function and structure of your application the dependencies of the various parts.. 

issue: Evening 
solution: you and your upside down world. i wonder if there's any difference in representing the solar system upside down. that is, are there any physical differences which made north pole "up". 

issue: if I have an @Input called test with a setter and getter, and in my template [<-CODE->] the binding is one way? if test changes value within the component, thevalue should not see a change? wachpwnski: look at [<-LINK->] and find the youtube presentation 
solution: no, just a set and get on the@Input.  I had a very strange bug. I have a md-select with chips in a component, with an input of the attributes, an input of the selected attributes, and an output emitter which fired when an attribute was selected. I was getting two of the selected chips show up in one place I used it, another place worked as expected.What it ended up being is the selected attributes coming from a deep object, and assigning the value to the@Input. when the value within the component changed, it mutated the state. I fixed it by doing val = [...valuesarray] and broke the chain.I still don't know how the value went backwards through the@Input.

issue: Anyone have any idea how to still use style encapsulation when a third party library injects dom in your component? 
solution: when I change, and refreshes the browser, but the change doesnt apply. I just setup my own webpack configs and use gulp to manage my tasks.... 

issue: how can I check if user is (or not) in the tab? 
solution: Toxicable: I need to know if an user is in the current tab (of his browser) looking at my app, or if he changed to another tab (not looking at it right now). 

issue: BustyLoli-Chan:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: When a value is inserted into the DOM from a template, via property, attribute, style, class binding, or interpolation, Angular sanitizes and escapes untrusted values.. Well I think according to that my template interpolation will be sanitized. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] I don't understand why synchronously it wouldn't yet be able to work out the current URL? it's just outright wrong 
solution: 

issue: As a complete newbie, can someone explain me what the void is for? [<-CODE->] 
solution: nunofreitasbotelho: in typescript, a type in that position specifies the return type of the function, in this case void means it returns but without a value. for example if your function was going to return a boolean you would want to specify the return type as boolean, not void. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] this condition doesn't add class to body 
solution: theromie: i'd double check your route config. Toxicable: i want to add no-scrolling to body if i show condition is true. 

issue: frederikprijck: ping 
solution: 

issue: in othwards I have a module that I have to do that stuff with so i can setup my services right

issue: Guys, in the past i made use of the BrowserDomAdapter which has been removed. Is there something like the BDA in 2.4? 
solution: 

issue: +1 
solution: 

issue: Why does the class get added right away without me touching the form? [<-CODE->] 
solution: ghetolay: But I use the exact same thing in another project and that works as expected, the field is required. As soon as I fill out a value the class is removed. I haven't used it with a form builder form previously though. 

issue: can I redirect my app from a service? 
solution: 

issue: Hey, can [class]=\'my-class\' can only replace a existing class="other-class" or somehow just add them together? 
solution: eXXeption: it adds. broweratcognitecdotcom: already found my mistake.. [class] is not how it works, its [ngClass]. worked too much with a framework where i can style the components with [class]. 

issue: Hi to all.  I'm starting with Angular and I'm planning to develop a UI frontend for a Rest Backend.

solution: 

issue: 500 images? what are you doing? 
solution: 

issue: istiti: Are you not sure why the Angular team hasn't 'fixed' it, or are you not sure why it happens at all? 
solution: Well not fixing is is probably a design decision as it could cause infinite change detection loops, so we're 'forced' to design around it. And why it happens: when you change a variable during change detection (e.g. ngAfterViewInit) that has an impact on change detection itself (e.g. changing a value that's part of an ngIf). stephanjust: and how find in which change detection I change variable (yes u'r right I use ngIf to show or hide div). 

issue: out of curiosity, anyone have issues debugging angular apps in IE11? lol' 
solution: hungerregnuh: I have issues... I don't use IE11 ;). i had e2e tests for IE/FF configured and someone overruled me saying we didn't need it :D. 

issue: Glad to know that Shai is now a core member 
solution: ericmartinezr: the interview is from 2016, he's a core member for almost a year now. yes it is, i've seen the part with shai offering his t-shirt before. I don't know how they hold themselves, I would be crying on the floor.

issue: is there any difference when doingclass="{{customClasses}}"as opposed to[ngClass]="customClasses"? 
solution: chrillewoodz: don't think the former supports arrays. I just pass it as a space separated string. I don't know why ngClass handle string as an input. 

issue: Good morning all! Morning all! 
solution: I've tried that, but they keep breaking when the bus gets too far away from my router..

issue: DzmitryShylovich: stop trying to guess what's his problem [<-ISSUE->] and make him to fill out the template 
solution: 

issue: Hey all, quick question about export class className {} ; Heres my class: [<-LINK->] it would be appropriate to put the addBus function in here? I'm picture the class to work like it would a php class 
solution: altinselimi: i want it to be an object so i can define my own index. ie buses[bus.id] = bus; That way i don't need to loop though the bus array to find the appropriate bus. I can just check if bus[id] exists, if it does the return that id.. 

issue: how to bind checkboxes with reactive forms? ????? 
solution: Toxicable: Could you please just check this txt file? Really facing strange behavior.. [<-LINK->]. basherr: Co. 

issue: is there also a way to only remove the formarray controls? 
solution: mlc-mlapis: sady no, need to remove them from the dom. you have to actually remove them. Toxicable: i messed up the index. it works, thank you all! :).

solution: 

issue: What are you using to run your tests? 
solution: i need to create a repro case, but i think i just ran into an odd 'bug' with change detection in IE. 

issue: I have a reactiveForm and am checking if it's possible to get isSubmitted or something simulair? But it isnt there not getting it int my function 
solution: masaanli: submmitedproperty is available only on a template based form. You have two options. The first is to control status by your own code as supposed from principe of reactive forms or the second which is to mix template based and reactive based forms but this is not recommended.. 

issue: How to emit observables synchronously? 
solution: Chris-Devine: that makes no sense. well whats best way to wait for data from an API before showing a modal?.

solution: rbahadoorifar-tgm: you'll get a better response if you just ask your question or provide context for discussion. 

issue: when should a module be loaded eagerly and when lazily? Is there a best practice on that? 
solution: philly-vanilly: well I think most of time you want lazy load for lazydownload. but I think in my context it would still fit - I get like 10 first results, then if the user scrolls down, i load another 10 results ..., but the whole surrounding interface can be loaded at the beginning when the user calls the main page. 

issue: angular/angular#15291fine 
solution: All I am stating it is now is becoming very.

solution: build.shsskipped over that. 

issue: Sorting for imports!!! 
solution: Support for emoji in the editor!!!. 

issue: whats the benefit of using async pipe instead of ts-code? 
solution: philly-vanilly: it's a bit more that sugar, it'll subscribe at component creation, unsubscribe on destroy and mark the change detection for check. 

issue: does a service not run unless it is injected? 
solution: if you look through github a little bit you'll find more information I'd say. I think they might have been putting in a flag or something so you don't have to do that. 

issue: Okay so let me summarize this for you-Angular dosen't support working in JS as much as TS-Angular's docs don't explain how to use external libs like RxJs and TS-No docs on do's and don'ts for AOTthat about it? 
solution: Angular2 was "complete" even though the build tool was in beta. 6 months in the build tool is still not ready. It breaks (live production builds) with no one seeming to mind that much. 

issue: I'd try wrapping the subscription block with setTimeout(() => { ... }) (without specified time) e.g.  [<-CODE->]

issue: Know any good recruiters in NZ ? very serious 
solution: DanPride: indeed I am a student. However, yes there are some reasonable companies hiring here. On the technology front, it's not so great though. NZ is largely .NET/React. I hear that Wellington has a reasonable Angular community but the Job websites don't necessarily reflect that. Avail for anything in NZ you hear about. Buy you a drink at the Hipi Pipi :).

issue: Does any one have any good resources for getting code coverage setup with the default webpack config from the guide? 
solution: Toxicable: it is a bit of a raw deal. I suppose I couldng ejectand try to merge the CLI webpack config with my own but its a little rough since I also use webpack for some non-angular 2 parts of the project.. He said run it, so I copy pasted but it's linked to all of this internal files, so how exactly are we meant to run it!?. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] The component: [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: Actually all of us gave this question few times but is release still scheduled for today? 
solution: so i am setting something from a keyup value to thus make a variable true or false. xtianus79: So You mean u have directive A which has some property which u want to be accessible inside your component? if yes than its simple on your directive@Input() value will be bound to your component property once it gets updated you get changed value inside component. it would be better to put some Rx logic over there as well..

issue: how does that feed into this stream? 
solution: it's long winded, but firebase stream fires a new user to the ngrx/store, which my component is subscribed too. I've never had any issue with ngrx/store, and this is the only external async part of the chain.

issue: How do i know what view needs functions, and when do the parent view need the functions or a child to the parent, where could i read more about this?

Im really bad at explaining this.

solution: It leaves out some steps that are obvious to non-noobs, but .... 

issue: What's you guys vender.js filesize when doing ng build --prod --aot ? 
solution: gets larger the more of Angular's modules you use. Same thing with third-party libraries. 

issue: rob what are the LTS plans? 
solution: you don't even use it. 

issue: It probably depends on how many modules you've imported. This is the default, I just ran a macro to remove them all. 408K to 388K

solution: 

issue: So in index.html the only special tags should be the one from component that is set in bootstrap? 
solution: Cause on quick look my problem was fixed by ether moving the <login> into the template of App, or by adding the LoginComponent into the list. 

issue: isn't it mandatory ? Just jumping in the discussion 
solution: I cant think of one where you would want to do that rather than just using Angular to do whatever you're trying to achieve. 

issue: i wanted to change [<-CODE->] To something better ideas? instead of using a function 
solution: alxhub: the string is a property actually but it seems not to be changed.it's an Input Property. 

issue: What does Inject in providers do ? I never had to put it there 
solution: 

issue: DzmitryShylovich: do you know if the docs have been updated for 4.0.0 final yet? 
solution: every time there is a return type that is a type union the rest of the docs is truncated, e.g.errors : ValidationErrors|. 

issue: can you a http request in a service with an observable and subscribe it right after? 
solution: there's a separate room for quick cli questions :). 

issue: DzmitryShylovich: what about it? 
solution: lazarljubenovic: just FYI. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: ofabricio: you're callinggetProjects()on every change detection, which results in a new subscription, which loses your accumulated state.. ofabricio: , savethis.projectsService.getProjects()into a property on the component in the constructor, and use the async pipe on that property instead.. 

issue: a button inside a form wait what, I thought it was native form submissions 
solution: create a small form in plunkr. 

issue: Are you providing it and exporting it? BustyLoli-Chan: ^^

issue: what do we win? 
solution: karma points :). 

issue: isn't it the purpose of reduce to build such objects? :) 
solution: I think this was more for number/string kind of output. idk I find it messy and don't really effective for objects. 

issue: Shared service? pull it into your components, and call the function 
solution: angular hates inheritance haha so i moved to use composition instead. 

issue: any idea why in the code below thecatchcode is never called? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: separate routers? or single? 
solution: TINITUS: well... each feature module has it's own router so I guess I'd call them separate :-?. but as far as I know the router combines them if it seesforChildin the main router so it's basically a singleton :-?. 

issue: how do I observe a variable object? 
solution: 

issue: you're still at the office ? 
solution: Right. okay. robwormald: yeah, I wrestled with sourcemaps until 7 or so. They're all messed up and we don't know why.. 

issue: does ngrx work with ng4? 
solution: for me I had some problems with my last sandbox project, it had an unresolved angular2 dependency. you only receive warnings duringnpm installwhich you can just ignore if you do not need shrinkwrapping at the moment. 

issue: IsGeolocationwindow.navigator.geolocation? 
solution: benydc: ... it is necessary to use operator as.distinct(pos => pos.coords.latitude)but you need to combine also withpos.coords.longitudeto be unique.. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] or youtube 
solution: Well there are “Pro” (aka you need to buy a subscription) to watch them videos on egghead that have angular specific examples with observable stuff, but unless you want to pay, I’d just go to youtube and search “angular rxjs” and watch everything lol. I watched this guy’s videos when I was first starting out - [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Is it a good practice to use a redirect in a resolver? 
solution: this seems incorrect because the resolver is not actually usedresolve(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot): Promise<User> {\n        return this.foo.getName().toPromise().then(x => {\n            this.router.navigate(['/profile', x.Id]);\n            return x;\n        });. 

issue: don't you define them on the router-outlet? I'm not sure and am curious myself 
solution: I think you can do it by applying an animation to the<router-outlet>. 

issue: I am trying to bundle and host my app with AOT. Everything is compile and Worked Routing also properly work. But My Component is not initiated .I am facing this problem in AOT non lazy loading.My App working properly in JIT.Please any one suggest me!!! 
solution: import { RouterModule } from '@angular/router';import { ListViewModule } from '../listview/listview.module';const appRoutes: any = [    { path: 'listview', loadChildren: '../listview/listview.module#ListViewModule' },    { path: '', redirectTo: 'listview/default', pathMatch: 'full' },];@NgModule({    imports: [        ListViewModule,        RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes)    ],    exports: [RouterModule]})export class SBRoutingModule { }.

issue: Hello from Egypt guys ! :Dhow are u?I have a question, I've asked it before but I'm missing sthhow can I send data from a component rendered inrouter-outletto another component some where else (not parent) thx :D 
solution: 

issue: Hello. What is the difference between<input (keyup)=“onKey($event.target.value)” />and<input #box (keyup)=“onKey(box.value)” />? Which of those is better to use and why? 
solution: osenvosem: #box creates a variable, in this case which is the element and allows other references to that element within the template. If you use #box elsewhere then it is required. Otherwise not.. derekkite: I know that. But if I want to pass a value to a handler, which of those ways would be preferable and why?. derekkite: because I saw this example in the documentation and I wonder what is the difference between these two ways to pass input value to a handler<input (keyup)=“onKey($event.target.value)” />and<input #box (keyup)=“onKey(box.value)” />?. 

issue: How to add button that takes image from local storage and displayed to text area ? 
solution: well then you probably want to start with that. Toxicable: want to get from local system not local storage . There is one example [<-LINK->] that justify my requirements but without tinymce or any other library is it possible to get image and display in text area .. 

issue: How goes, all? :D 
solution: 

issue: How would I get an Enum available for use on a template? 
solution: and use google please :). or use a string literal union type. 

issue: there's a new a.io site in the works? 
solution: hmmm i always thought the current onewasthe new one lol. hungerregnuh:  [<-LINK->]. danke sir.... i think i read "new site coming" then i found the a.io site and just assumed it was the new one lol. 

issue: Is there a way to force the router to navigate to the same url the user is already on when clicking arouterLink? eg: User is on page /orders and clicks the /orders link again,  the page navigates again? 
solution: Toxicable: I load our old legacy app through an iframe on our new angular app and everything works very well. I have the legacy app send apostMessageto the parent angular app when a url changes inside the iframe and then the angular app updates the url to match the iframes url. But if the user is on page /orders?status=1 and clicks the /ordersrouterLink, nothing happens. I guess angular thinks they are the same url because the params aren't counted as unique url or something.... 

issue: nodi\'m looking for a "version" drop down or similar 
solution: v2 and v4. 

issue: Is it intentional that my aot build is bigger (CLI 1.0 + Angular 4)? [<-CODE->] vs. [<-CODE->] 
solution: binarious: yes,  you should use lazy loading. the aot does increase the size of your code, but reduce the size of vendor bundle and speed up the things. also, try to compare the gzip size, there you might see nicer numbers. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] anybody know how this is possible? 
solution: 

issue: any nativescript and angular2 user here? 
solution: DanPride: just wanted to know possible issues that I might encounter if I use those to build mobile apps. jezmaghuyop: No idea to be honest, headed there but haven't gotten there, but would LOVE to have a list to follow,.... kinda like looking over the edge at the obis :). 

issue: y ou are right, 2400 watchers. Won't be me. I prefer to look, label and stop looking 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: You have to understand that we are developing it right now. We are putting triple extra effort on it. It is normal all the buzz about the new site. Once we finish, it gets back to normal as@Toxicablesaid. 

issue: why does ng lifecycle hooks does not work in@NgModuleclass??? 
solution: 

issue: what does the animations have to do with_expanded? 
solution: using enter and leave transitions. yeah. also using onpush change detection. 

issue: or you can use jquery without any trackby 
solution: just use binary obviously. use cli. you can do preboot with platform-server. 

issue: any plans to add webstorm setup? mostly curious since i get a lot of questions from folks at work 
solution: things like protractor/karma setup and language services... all really easy googleable stuff i suppose. 

issue: Anyone else use this pattern? [<-CODE->] 
solution: nrbrigmon: It creates an observable that never emits or completes.. 

issue: normal service? :P 
solution: yeah was looking for a name that clearly says. always a new one. 

issue: 4.1.0 is beta :D 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] 
solution: that else syntax is still the shittiest angular thing ever. 

issue: 'how' did you try to open it? 
solution: but that wikitudePlugin function will not know how to open the .ts as well..... 

issue: 12 40 am? a call?@mlc-mlapis 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: there is no bug here we can't change a form. I think he just wants to reset the value. 

issue: Is it possible to like, slide in sites from the sides, top or bottom on navigation 
solution: 

issue: man I need to get this aot build sped up 
solution: ronnyek: Then you're pretty much as fast as it'll go lolhow long does it take for a build?. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] For example : [<-CODE->] Is this even possible ? 
solution: DzmitryShylovich: So if I only add my provider to a module it will never be created again ? that's not the behavior I am seeing (with lazy loaded module at least). 

issue: excluding that stuff shaved 2 minutes off a npm restore 
solution: cut 30sec off aot build but still at 3.5. 

issue: I'm trying to see if I really don't include those modules anywhere 
solution: gets to optimizing at 92%. and at least one of the modules it complains about not being included are actually included. 

issue: how can I do something like this: [<-CODE->] how should I do 
solution: it's a string.. i want to show a string or an icon if there is no string. 

issue: Hi guys, I have a bugs onbuild --prodbut not onserve 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] ??? 
solution: 

issue: why use the $ after "groups"?groups$ 
solution: nrbrigmon: it means groupsStream. 

issue: How to I use the ng-include from angularJS to angular? 
solution: MoLt1eS: You can't just include templates in angular like you can in angularjs. mlc-mlapis: Just started yesterday learning front-end never touched npm and angular (100% newbie), did the tutorial and now im stuck at adding a static footer to all the pages, can I use Angular with AngularJS?. 

issue: use an (output) or a service I would think 
solution: router has route change end output events. josephliccini: no need for output or service it can injectngSwitchCase likedirectly. josephliccini: Guess I am just cut my teeth on COD and everything just looks like a nail to a hammer, I would setup a backend field for the order, and one for the show/hide, then do anngFor using the users stored sort order, with anngIf="show"> for if he wants to see it. You could also do the same thing with lazy loaders maybe.. 

issue: What am I missing here !?1.2 + 0.1 + 0.1 = 1.4000000000000001 
solution: ghetolay: numbers in JS are 64 floats. ghetolay: JS is not precise. you need to use a library for . number to be precise. 

issue: what are you doing? 
solution: if I replace import core-js/es7/reflect in polyfills.ts. with import 'reflect-metadata'. 

issue: Do you have any@typesinstalled? 
solution: also: [<-LINK->]. but they say it should work with angular 4. I can't say really, never used NS before. 

issue: Did they screw up the countdown on [<-LINK->] ? 
solution: Think it counts down to a set point of time but in the users locale. 

issue: what is the news from ngconf? :) 
solution: you can take a look at my notes if you want [<-LINK->] THey’re pretty bad but I think they have most key points. 

issue: can't seem to understand how to pass an array from one component to another with the@Input if i do@Input arrayon the component father and then <component-child [array]= array></component-child> 
solution: kylecannon: ``` Can't bind to 'resultsnamesvalue' since it isn't a known property of 'app-results-details'.If 'app-results-details' is an Angular component and it has 'resultsnamesvalue' input, then verify that it is part of this  ```. 

issue: Is there a reason why a style sheet will not have any impact when using the Component as a Dialog ? 
solution: mancart: a) many modal implementations insert the modal directly into the <body>-tag so your css-tags might be wrong. b) view encapsulation might screw up your case. stephanjust: I think its just bootstrap that is not loading because if I set the background or any other normal attribute it does take affect... if I use -webkit stuff it seems to not apply. 

issue: 1 
solution: 

issue: $exists: () => boolean; what does this mean in an interface? That $exists is a function that returns a boolean? 
solution: Constructors are optional as long as the class doesn't inherit from another, in which case you'd need to have a contructor calling super(). I guess Interfaces can only have function signatures, right? So I soon as I want to use this function (implement them) I have to create a class that implements the Interface, right?. 

issue: what is the solution to my issue?demo.js [<-CODE->] How do I call this notifcation function on typecript component I don't know why my question is not answered 
solution: msskjoldager_twitter: yes for the(click)it is work. The problem is when a user submit the form then according to the server response I need to notify the user, so I need to call the function inside the typescript component [<-LINK->]. 

issue: how can i define a global direcitve 
solution: ccommando: ... but I suppose that you needshared moduleand your directive should be a part of it. Shared module is imported to other modules.. 

issue: istiti: I have a model folder where I have all these definitions. 
solution: istiti: I vaguely remember trying to mix interfaces with components and having similar trouble. 

issue: I'm getting the following, but I have angular core and common @ 4.0.1 and zone.js @ 0.8.5 [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] what the ever loving fuck its defined right there. 
solution: ronnyek: look into ForwardRef.. if I want people to consume my module and get at services, do I need to export services. when providing a service, if you provide it in a non lazy context; it will be registered on the root injector. 

issue: So is WebPack the new way of doing things or SystemJS ? Which one is more supported or better ? 
solution: mancart: Angular-CLI originally used SystemJS, then somewhere near August last year they moved to WebPack, and this should be enough to say it.. If you are new to this however I suggest you to use CLI. It is VERY limiting, as you can't customise the configuration and add for example PostCSS stuff, but it is very simple to use. Easier learning curve. Check [<-LINK->]. 

issue: I wouldn't know about the cli.. it cant support lazy lazy loaded things.. it is awesome for what it's worth though 
solution: 

issue: Why is the ng-conf schedule all wrong? 
solution: I guess I figured [<-LINK->] would be the schedule for what the livestream is showing. 

issue: Have you read this [<-LINK->] ? 
solution: I want to use dump components for the list and details. 

issue: can anyone give me an idea on how i can implement a near real time timer on an angular app this timer is there to prevent deadlock in seat reservation 
solution: so when a user selects a seat and starts payment processing they get 3 minutes to go to that payment portal and confirm their seat. 

issue: You can use@Ouputto do this 
solution: 

issue: the way you’re trying to do it is fine since it works alright here [<-LINK->] 
solution: I don’t think Material is doing anything weird here. but need to get it working withmd-raised-button:). 

issue: Question - will this import statement end up bringing in all Observable operators?import {Observable} from "rxjs"; 
solution: 

issue: Why ngFor is going to be renamed to ngForOf? what's the reason behind this 'breaking-change' ? 
solution: ngFor is already called ngForOf. That\'s based on it\'s syntax:*ngFor="let a of aList"The alias interface is simply gone. 

issue: Did anyone try to build a pluggable framework yet? 
solution: And it's like running into a wall with 100 km/h. In my case I wouldn't say 100 km/h but a lot of open issues, was wondering if someone took something like this to production or so. 

issue: can youconsole.logcreditCardGroupinput in your component?  what are you getting? 
solution: 

issue: Guys what is the difference between acquiring instances using the "Injector" vs using providers? 
solution: pantonis: i dont think you ever need to useInjectordirectly, as far as i can tell, if you  check the style guide its not mentioned at all. 

issue: the cli dosen’t provide github pages deploy anymore 
solution: always gets parsed. 

issue: do you have any event listeners? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. check if any are listening on contextmenu. yeah I saw that. 

issue: what was it?  at this point I’m just scanning for typos :D 
solution: : drum roll :. not the edit credit card component. 

issue: what does that even mean? 
solution: Were you talking to me?. 

issue: Are you on v4? Because deep imports aren't allowed on v4 
solution: Apparently that lib works if you create a project with Angular CLI which I must say I'm getting really sick of hearing that.. finally back working with angular after a month of doing enterprise java. Fock. BallisticPain: that dosent sound right to be, v4 made it not possible to use deep imports. 

issue: hello can sameone help me !! 
solution: ZeinebBnYoussef: you already found [<-LINK->] , this here is an angular 2+ room. People (mostly) don't know AngularJs (and your question is very vague). 

issue: personally id wait until all my 3rd party imports supported the angular 4 upgrade or find replacement 3rd party imports. What your doing is a very bad idea. 
solution: ChrisDevinePimss: I need to keep working, I don't know alternatives to Auth0, and even if changing it now would require too much time, I'd rather play it dirty. 

issue: again ? 
solution: 

issue: Can you listen to a custom event emitted from component in a child directive? 
solution: 

issue: what time is it there right now? 
solution: 

issue: how are you calling that http method? 
solution: getAllUsers(url:string, token:any){let headers = new Headers();this.createAuthorizationHeader(headers, token);return this.http.get(url, {headers:headers})}. 

issue: ghetolay: What did you mean? 
solution: Matmo10: I meant you should listen insideSearchComponentfor the first url and insideItemDetailsComponentfor the second. ghetolay: I’m listening inside an independent service. 

issue: How goes? I'm waiting to board my flight back home 
solution: yeah bit of an odd one. alxhub: so yeah, I ditched trying to use webpack to make that bundle that I was trying to do last night in favour of rollup. if you wanna take a look [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Hi, does anyone know how to add a directive from typescript, rather than from the template? 
solution: 

issue: ... maybe also some extra bundling of Angular itself could help, for example separate template and reactive forms modules, ... 
solution: ... and the best cherry will be availability of creating new moduleson-demand... transparently on the server.. well yeah, that’s the idea.You should be able to make and deploy new plugins without redploying thebaseapp. ... I meant also without a programmer.  Just on the base of HTML template that could be designed in UI using some WYSIWYG editor.. 

issue: :D 
solution: Toxicable: I was disappointed you didn't ask any question. That was more overarching questions. not technical ones. 

issue: @danielhazratireturns true if lessonForm.dirtyso user can move on only if it has touched the form ? 
solution: I would have thought the logic would be:1) mark form as pristine2) navigate away (user can now pass guard because form is not dirty)but that does not work, solution:1) navigate away2) mark form as pristine. 

issue: Nothing happens to what? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: TL;DR [<-LINK->]. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] I get 404 error, although pasting this URL in a browser will return a JSON. what did I miss? 
solution: 

issue: @bastiankhalil ... what do you mean by?I am trying to prevent multiple clicking on a button 
solution: yes Its like add a directive to any button so I can disable it for a while if there is any function id going on.. 

issue: isn\'t there an html attributedisabled="disabled" ? 
solution: but this seems to create another click event ( which is normal) so I need to catch the click on the orginal button here..

issue: istiti: ... is there anything in AOT that will help you a lot during dev? 
solution: istiti: webpack shows a percentage as it compiles. Does it seem to get stuck on any particular number?. Also, you might consider testing out anng ejectand then running webpack in verbose mode..

solution: 

issue: How complex is your project? 
solution: 

issue: FormControl valueChanges subscriptions are automatically unsubscribed on view destroy? 
solution: on clicking on some button somtimes it navigate to other page but does not show any thing. 

issue: angular doesnt support replacing components does it? 
solution: selector include a specific hierarchy that my stuff doesnt currently match only because of the component tag appearing. 

issue: Is there an easy way to debug/log which components are running change detection in our app? 
solution: you do the actual work you need to do. and most likelt run it out of Zone. chasemgray: not really, there's a few different ways you can do it like; the ngDoCheck, the profiler, BatScanner.

solution: 

issue: Is it possible to import a pipe to one and only one component or does it have to be at the module level? 
solution: clintsinger: If you declare a pipe in a module, you don't need to also import it using the imports array. You do have to add an imports statement for it in the component..

issue: Is there a way for a directive to set a property in the component it is attached to? 
solution: nosachamos: that gives the element, but not the component, right?. derekkite: take a look at this [<-ISSUE->] if you haven't seen already. 

issue: What's the point of the stacktrace of angular ?  [<-CODE->] talk about confusion sorry for this 
solution: I had not initialized@Output emitter. The first couple lines are angular internal. nosachamos: ViewContainerRef injected has _embeddedViews array, which is the component. No to figure out if it is useful. 

issue: When using http.get is there a way to get all of the headers and not just the content-type header? 
solution: 

issue: what isn’t responsive? 
solution: MaxGoh: with flex layout it is quite simple; you fxLayout.lg="row" fxLayout.md="column" to get a different layout depending on the width of the screen. I don\'t know how different the direct css stuff is..

solution:

solution: 

issue: binary to ascii maybe? 
solution: though is there something I should look for in the response header or req header?. i'd make sure the headers match between both of your api calls working vs non-working. 

issue: Does anyone know what could be wrong here? [<-LINK->] 
solution: chrillewoodz: you have to write a<router-outlet></router-outlet>, withoutpageprefix.. 

issue: Can I use the currency pipe with the async pipe? 
solution: I'd assume async then currency?. for example, I created a userCurrency pipe. 

issue: guys, can somebody help me w/ chained resolvers? What is a proper approach to chain resolves? e.g. a components needs result from resolverA; resolverA builds a query depending on a result from resolverB.( [<-LINK->] ) 
solution: oligsei: ... Angular internally processes resolvers in the same order as you put them inresolveobject. The result will depends on the async/sync type of each of them, time, ... so on ... so it is mainly on you how you will process the results ... and what you will have on the end. [<-CODE->]. I want to perform certain actions depending on the notification received, for example modify the counter that there is a new notification, customize the redirection by clicking on the notification, handle the text and the icon that will show the notification .. and i need to do that logic with angularAnd push and push click event are only working within the sw-precache file that is the worker I am registering. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] why would I get .map doesn't exist here 
solution: I imported HttpModule. import {Http, Response, Headers, RequestOptions} from'@angular/http';. 

issue: Morning all :) 
solution: or anything for creating infinite scroll effects (like horizontal navs). 

issue: Is there any way to cancel a click event from within a 'mousedown' event handler? 
solution: As in, when my directive is applied to an element, I'd like to listen for 'long-press' events. To do this, I capture a mousedown event and see if the mouseup event doesn't come for a certain amount of time. Problem is, a click event occurs on mouseup in this scenario and I'd like to prevent this ONLY if the user wasn't holding the mouse down long enough for it to count as a long press.. superamadeus: then also use a custom event for click(quickclick)(longclick). 

issue: Hey what's up 
solution: 

issue: what's a good thing to use for a configservice ? 
solution: 

issue: Does anyone have an idea why i need to call ChangeDetectorRef detectChanges manually to make my UI upate?

solution: 

issue: Hi, how can i make vendor.js in multiple files with ng-clivendor1.js vendor2.js... in prod 
solution: beligh-hamdi: that will not help you mostly. What you need is to split your code into modules and go with lazy-loading and lazy-routes. 

issue: lol it's still not possible in that room either 
solution: ghetolay: Could you please explain this behavior? [<-LINK->]. 

issue: test 
solution: is there a built-in way to convert a date from UTC to local. I was hoping the Date pipe would do it for me. 

issue: just import common module then 
solution: seems like you could just import that module, and additionally import common module in your root module. 

issue: guys Ionic has some default startup projects with ionic cli. Does angular cli has the same? 
solution: I downloaded this [<-LINK->]. I tried npm install then npm start. 

issue: I think it's trouble having class on store 
solution: I think I can see some benefit of the redux like model. ronnyek: it\'s all well and good for "flat" state. ronnyek: it's very powerful and clear if used together with@ngrx/effects. 

issue: do you have types installed for them? 
solution: If I get the types does that mean I don't need the require or will the require work then?. 

issue: Cannot find name 'ComponentInstruction'. anyone know how to solve this ? 
solution: Toxicable: i tried import { Routes, RouterModule , ActivatedRoute ,CanActivate, Router , componentInstruction   } from'@angular/router'; but its giving error for componentinstruction. 

issue: can we obfuscate angular components? 
solution:   I know.. but my point is I have some variables that are pretty obvious and anyone can understand them..  I want to leave them as they are in typescript but when they transpile I want to change them to something that cannot be understood... by anyone.. not even me. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] You can't do this can you? 
solution: chrillewoodz: yes. ghetolay: Yes as in I can?. yes. 

issue: How can I store a global variable with angular 2 or 4 ? 
solution: MaguranSorbonne: but I would store it in some common service.. kodwi: You know how can I delete a required in a formControl in the component  after I build a formBuilder in the constructor ?. 

issue: [routerLink] do you need the brackets? link is a string 
solution: i also tried using link strings[routerLink]==['/link']which did not change anything. 

issue: morning? 
solution: a working plnkr of your problem/question is usually best :D. hard to tell from your example, based on what's there it looks like you're assigning values to [<-CODE->]. 

issue: Hey guys i Have this function: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Is this AOT compatible? 
solution: robwormald: it is really weird scenario.. After the user logs in they have a different API gateway they connect to depending on what their current tenant selected there. So i need that basePath to be a function so it can be updated lol. 

issue: Is there a way for me to choose what template a component uses from my component rather than hand coding it into the component delcaration? 
solution: Toxicable: Yah, I know, but it'll still mean if I want ot make a change at the core level, it'lll be in multiple places :p. 

issue: Guys, do you know what is the progress on closure compiler with angular? 
solution: ghetolay: with tree-shaking and lazy-loading?. bobrosoft: I don't know the specifics but some are using it. 

issue: Property 'prisitine' does not exist on type 'NgModel'? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: can you use ngModel on a checkbox? 
solution: BustyLoli-Chan: Yes.. I was hoping we could leverage the ngModel so that the state change would propagate upward multiple levels without having to emit events. Either a checkbox doesn't handle the scenario as well as a regular text input, or else I'm thinking about it wrong. Not sure which.. 

issue: Hey, I'm having trouble finding any documentation on ngContent. Does anybody know if this is intentional or just hasn't been written yet? I'm wondering if it might maybe be called something else or maybe is being phased out? 
solution: 

issue: ^ hmm? 
solution: 

issue: by fork you mean what? 
solution: 

issue: xampp in 2017 :D 
solution: (ngFor Let variable of Array) //Property variable does not exist on type 'any[]'?. 

issue: Toxicable: use you angular cli ? 
solution: not much lately since i’ve been busy. but would still always recommend it. Toxicable: have you 3mn to test litle project I [<-LINK->] so light (2comp./2mod.)  just runnpm i && ng son it. 

issue: screenshots and code are completely valid, but a plnkr is always the best option :D 
solution: 

issue: Haalp [<-LINK->] 
solution: I always had a feeling that the items were being stacked like a deck of cards but I couldn't check if that was actually the case since nativecript lacks a view inspector. ghetolay: Ye I am, some things are ridiculously over-complicated but some things works great. The main difference is the layout, you can't use html and certain css props like display and position. So I'd say layout and using something like a sidebar are the stuff that's complicated.. 

issue: Guys, with flex, how do you guys styling for router-outlet? 
solution: 

issue: there is a focus/select directive? or do I have to create my own? 
solution:  [<-LINK->].  [<-LINK->]. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] ? 
solution: 

issue: Is there a way I can force Angular's dependency injector to create a new instance of a service every time it's injected? I know I could just specify it as a provider on every component that uses it, but this is for a library and I'd like to be able to hide that detail from users 
solution: robwormald: Not sure if you remember the previous questions I've asked here, but I'm still working (slowly) on that WebGL renderer / game engine for Angular. And I got some pretty strong feedback that game developers don't take kindly to having to write a bunch of style bindings individually :(. 

issue: hello guys I am learning angular and it is so cool! 
solution: 

issue: just uploaded my first node module =) [<-LINK->] 
solution: It would be a good idea to put a small summary in. 

issue: anyone build anything and used rollup with it? 
solution: broweratcognitecdotcom: yeah I am specifically using that, but it seems like your library basically cant reference or depend on any other angular libraries or rollup freaks out. 

issue: Does anyone use the yeoman angular2_library generator? 
solution: yes you are right. So what@injectableis used for? If I use the service at multiple place and one provider?. stefdelec: @Injectable() marks a class as available to an injector for instantiation. Generally speaking, an injector reports an error when trying to instantiate a class that is not marked as@Injectable().. 

issue: use a function ? 
solution: if all your routes have that guard you could map the array. 

issue: Hi guys, what is the replacement forthis.renderer.createElement()in ng4? worked fine in ng2 but deprecated 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: s0fthunter: pipes can fire every time change detector fires. I'd personally build a service that had a cache of some sort so that hits normally destined to the service would return immediately for similar requests. 

issue: hi. why does this give me an error? can't I use the environment variable in a component, only in ngmodule? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: guys how to bind values to disabled inputs?? 
solution: 

issue: Is there a short expression for setting HTML classAwhenexpressionis true but set classBotherwise? 
solution: I'd like to alternate between two bootstrap button classesbtn-primaryandbtn-secondaryin case of abooleanexpression. 

issue: how do i do to look for a resource in VScode like eclipse 
solution: broweratcognitecdotcom: but i want to search quick in the JS. 

issue: Anybody got an opinion on whether to use bootstrap or MD?? 
solution: GuskiS: Which one is the most officially supported? It seems they both have their widgets. Both claim to be made by members of the Angular team. But we want to use the one that is the most likely best candidate for long term development. The quality of each seems about the same. Personally, I don't see much difference except for the way MD styles inputs and whatnot.. 

issue: CamusAran: You'll probably need to add it to yourprovidersarray in your module. 
solution: CamusAran: just add it todeclarations:in the module you want to own the pipe.. alxhub: then I get "No provider for myPipe". 

issue: Anyone got a clue? [<-LINK->] 
solution: chrillewoodz: ... should be{asyncValidator: CustomValidators.passwordsEqual()}. 

issue: .subscribe(data => data);what is this supposed to do ? 
solution: so you need to subscribe but you're supposed to do something inside. I think you want to change your map with subscribe. 

issue: how can I use pipes with ngModel? 
solution: in the end ngrx is just a tool, if it don't help you just avoid it. I have this<input #nameInput type="text" name="Name" class="form-control" [(ngModel)]="item.Name | zeroNumberToString" required maxlength="100">. 

issue: Is here anyone who has worked with service workers? 
solution: alex. only google guys to work with such new feature :). usually he comes in ~ 5hours. sleep time right now :). 

issue: Is it compulsory to have Angular/Cli installed globally? or I can use only the local angular cli? 
solution: 

issue: Do you have any errors? 
solution: In your reducer try this: [<-CODE->]. 

issue: It's not a requirement to have theapp-bundlebe on a<script defer>tag for Angular, correct? (i.e. one could use<script async>and start the app while DOM is loading?) 
solution: ghetolay: ... hmm, I don't why but I connectediterable iterfacetogether withSet objects... [<-LINK->] where it is true the following statementSet objects are collections of values. You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order. A value in the Set may only occur once; it is unique in the Set's collection... no not using universal, but we have a little bit of static HTML DOM rendered for cross site branding and whatnot (it's not too much) but on our measurements show with defer (which I think is same effect as putting at end of body) its not beginning to bootstrap Angular until DOM is fully parsed, but it would be a good idea (I think) to have all services instantiated and module getting started to bootstrap while the DOM is parsing. [<-CODE->]. 

issue: this.contactsList = [...this.contactsList, new Contact()] is that what you mean@benydc 
solution: this works:this.contactsList.push(new Contact(contact.name.formatted, contact.phoneNumbers[0].value, contact.photos));. 

issue: when using AOT it is not possible to use something like: [<-CODE->] what is the alternative to this in typescript? 
solution: into new array instead of replacing the array?isn't this contradictory ?. 

issue: Is there a good (functionality  + look and feel)  data table you can recommend? 
solution: MJomaa: I've used this and worked well - [<-LINK->]. nosachamos: Ngx-datatable has some nice functionality but looks like poop :(. 

issue: what's the source ? 
solution: From aswitchMap. one for each purpose. I can't because then the part prior to switchMap gets doubled.. this._mouseDown$.switchMap(() => this._mouseMove$.takeUntil(this._mouseUp$)))is the code I want to capture thefirst()from separately.. 

issue: istiti: are you trying to extend a class for components? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] I get error 
solution: benydc: you will need an Enum. 

issue: Does anyone know what is the purpose of having the UpgradeAdapter and UpgradeModule? both of them? 
solution: istiti: that link does not mention much about the UpgradeAdapter. Is mostly about the UpgradeModule.. @istitithe question is, what is the purpose of having both? As of my understanding, it is possible to achieve the same things with both (UpgradeModule and UpgradeAdapter).Also I am aware the UpgradeModule is newer and it is in the experimental phase, but why have both?The reason I am asking is because I have already a big hybrid application using the UpgradeAdapter, and would like to know also if this last component will get deprecated at some point.. 

issue: why I cannot have: [<-CODE->] and I can have  [<-CODE->] why it does not accept string 
solution: lithqube: I could add the string inside TypeA but I dont want to do this every time I need to use provide. pantonis: you can try:{provide: 'SOME_STRING', useValue: 'value of the string constant'},and than use it asconstructor (@Inject('SOME_STRING') private variableName: string) {}. 

issue: is it bad to subscribe to stuff in the constructor as opposed to ngOnInit? 
solution: if you get use to doing it you might run into issues with testing or when you want to use your@Input's in your stream. Right, but if the subscription is just for subscribing to an ngrx store, or subscribing to router events, etc that don’t really require the component to be “initialized” yet, I’m just curious if it really matters or if its mainly a style/preference/convention. 

issue: Good morning all :) 
solution: although, with that error kind of shot in the dark :D. 

issue: How to make Hostlistener to listen to events only within a specific component? 
solution: Mohendran: ... I mean the component to which you are applying@HostListener() decorator.. 

issue: how can we append the content which comes from the service ? ex. on load more button I have to append the content to the existing one 
solution: 

issue: why not better do that in the component? 
solution: 

issue: has anyone here experience why calling this.router.navigate within a callback always returns "Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Cannot read property \'router\' of undefined" 
solution: 

issue: Is It possible to use Promise with useFactory DI ? [<-LINK->] 
solution: don't think this work with async. you may want to use the resolve guard instead. also service are singleton so your factory will only run once andreturn userService.getActiveUser()may change over time. 

issue: Is there any “preserve query params” functionality forrouterLinks? 
solution: Matmo10: ... yes.. mlc-mlapis: I see[queryParams]={…}but I don’t see how to preserve them without manually listing them out there. 

issue: Do I have enough signatures for this function?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: alxhub: heh you got <any> in there, it's all you need right?. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] What is wrong on the following? [<-CODE->] 
solution: born2net: ... but compiler knows that when[xxx]="something"thensomethingis an expression always. The other thing is what is the result of the expression.. 

issue: is it possible to use a JQuery plugin function inside angular 2 component? 
solution: ezequielzacca: ... generally yes but avoid it, it is only complication.. yeah i know but i have a theme wich comes with a plugin for notifications built with JQuery id like to reuse instead of rewriting or changing it for another. 

issue: There has to be a better way to get a route parameter than injecting ActivatedRoute isn't there?    like /xyz/:id 
solution: wz2b: ... hmm, it is about a subscription to observable, ... so you need to unsubscribe, ... not sure if something simpler can exist.. 

issue: Hey guys, what the correct way to programatically add an error to a form control? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: mlc-mlapis: ... and the directive is declared where? 
solution: mlc-mlapis: there is actually one instance of HoverTooltipComponent shared by all TooltipDirective instances — it just gets its content changed and gets moved around to where it needs to live depending on which tooltip is being shown. 

issue: dagopert_twitter: ... even for testing it would be more suitable. 
solution: mlc-mlapis: you are a genius ;) it's working. mlc-mlapis: besides it's way more comprehensible. 

issue: should i use promise or observable for my api calls? 
solution: is one better then another?. then why have the two different approaches?. 

issue: is there a way to load in json data to a class? 
solution: compscilaw_twitter: ... the question is how to check or validate the structure ... or just cast for typing.. umm ... sorta the cast option, but i need some level of control.  for instance my serverside entity has php dates. compscilaw_twitter: ... I recommend usinginterfacefor cast typing and in some cases using something as [<-LINK->] from Victor.. 

issue: How can I have a ‘change password’ component with a prefix form parameter in the url? 
solution: mlc-mlapis: I’m currently trying to create a component to ‘change password’So the API uses a token which I don’t really want it to be shown in the form input, instead I could email users the URL with the token prefixed into the URL. 

issue: does :host not work for you? 
solution: 

issue: why you need that? 
solution: 

issue: Hi 
solution: Karthi-SRV: ...  it would interesting ... do you have concrete knowledge how to effectively do it if you do it in vanilla JS because it is something what can be easily implemented in Angular then.. Karthi-SRV: ... I suppose that it is mainly working arround some API supported in actual browsers.. 

issue: I'm struggling to figure out how to inject Http into a service, any guidance? 
solution: so I could inject Http into my data service, but when I tried to inject that data servic elsewhere, it ran into problems. 

issue: hey guys! I'm looking at change log for 4.1.0 and at strictNullChecks, and then here -angular/angular@5293794. what are these!for???? like the one here: [<-CODE->] 
solution: so, I have now errorsObject is possibly 'null'.all over the place. Should I just turn strict null checking off for now?. so in component rendering... is there a way to have a component have a tag selector, but actually render as a div.

solution: mlc-mlapis: i send a request to server: give me this page with another language. Server responds with right json, but my page doesnt refresh.. 

issue: guys,  does angular 4 supports nvd3? 
solution: 

issue: what is this.switchMap(x => x);? switchMap expects a function to return anObservable x isn’t an Observable 
solution: encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.NativeWhy does this cause all components to inject all nested components styles into the dom body, if we have a component (on the page 3 times) with 50 nested components it results in  150 <style> tags being injected. 

issue: Why does the top code work, and the bottom doesn't:  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: offtopic : is whatsapp working for you guys? :P 
solution: 

issue: checked Bazel docs, now have a headache :D looks not any intuitive from the first sight %) 
solution: bobrosoft: most of the documentation is concerned with thewritingof build rules. Use of Bazel as a consumer, on the other hand, involves the composition of rules declared by other people.. alxhub: i.e. for ng2 build, for example, I will need to use set of somebody's rules (like plugins) and use them as functions and passing params into them and combine them?. 

issue: Anyone could help me understand why I still need to provide the service in app.component.ts even if it's already provided in app.module.ts?Because I'm encountering this issue on running a testFailed: No provider for PostService! 
solution:

solution: 

issue: Is it possible for googlebot to properly scrape my site with just AOT (not Universal)? I'm finding Universal impossible to implement, I can't find any working guides for Angular 4... 
solution: ghetolay: @leBoerI'm no expert either but: [<-LINK->] (I'd say it should still work without server side rendering, despite the deprecation). 

issue: Any thoughts on why the compiler wouldn't be able to findParamsin@angular/router? It's definitely there. 
solution: Tonamel: you have one of two possible issues. One there is a typo in your code. Two typescript is incorrectly configured.. No typo in my code, and the project was initialized with angular-cli (so I assume the typescript config is standard). 

issue: Guys quick question, what's the best way to display a warning message to all internet explorer users to get a better browser? 
solution: 

issue: core module can be considered a feature module ? 
solution: 

issue: and, is that your suggestion for how the constructor of my directive should look? 
solution: Your assumption is correct. See the snippet above to get an idea of what I want to do.. 

issue: anyone here using sw-precache ? 
solution: Bretto: well what I mean is when you update your app, but it keeps pulling the old cache... I didn't have this problem a month ago when I first used it, so not sure what I did to make this pop up. I have to do a hard refresh in chrome to get updated files. 

issue: can someone recommend me a tutorial/guide on how to profile the performance of an angular app? is it ok to use [(ngModel)] and (ngModelChange) ? 
solution: Apeteceume_twitter: ... just[ngModel] and (ngModelChange)to avoid duplication of output event.. Apeteceume_twitter: ... yes ... it will work as you suppose ... but with[(ngModel)] and (ngModelChange)the output is doubled because[(ngModel)]is input + output.. 

issue: how would you fire effect just once and then just use the value from the store ? 
solution: You can read the value from the store without an effect. You should dispach the action that sets that data in the store once (on app or page init) and then have the dropdown read it with a select from the store I guess.... 

issue: are the .map files supposed to show up as sources in chrome dev tools? 
solution: mlc-mlapis: right. but I can't get my vscode to download the sourcemaps, so I wasn't sure if by it saying it can't findlocalhost:9443\\main.bundle.js.mapit means it actually wasn't loaded. If I go directly to that url, i get the proper mapping file though. So I have no clue why the vscode debugger can't download it..

issue: hi do you use ng-template? and why? I don't really see the point 
solution: you define a template once and inject it multiple times. or even ngIf, where you can remove/add a template. 

issue: 1) yes, absolutely. 2) it happens inswitchMapin this call:this.heroSearchService.search(term)

solution: BenevidesLecontes: but you don't want to use this for going backwards in angular routing?useValue: windowI would assume, because window <> Window. dklmuc: i already tried Location.back for this purpose but it won’t work. so i’m trying to use Window.history.back();. BenevidesLecontesso: if it's for internal angular routing then window.history.back() is wrong, because it will make a new server call with new bootstrapping and so on.

It can generate a new project for you, scaffold out new components, services, etc, so you don’t have to write boilerplate code yourself. 

issue: in Angular how do I create a promise that resolves when all promises in an array are resolved?

issue: Router question: I'm adding queryParams to the current route via router.navigate but the associated resolver is not executed. How do I fix this? 
solution: 

issue: Hi all quick question, what is the best way to force change detection in a specific component? 
solution: Have a component which takes an interface of categories, in the parent component which utilizes this child component, I have someone who wants to give the interface in the constructor but when they specify it in the custroctur it does not show the update that they put, and that is because the interface is only loaded initially once so triggering change detection I think solves this? or is there a better way?. 

issue: Anyone know ifFormGrouphas an api to get the original values that it was initialized with? 
solution: third774: ...setValueandpatchValueis general concept even for versioning, initialization, submiting, .... mlc-mlapis: - looking through the source code, it doesn't look likeFormControlorAbstractControlstore the values they were initialized with in a property that is separate from the property that gets updated whensetValueorpatchValueget called, so I don't think what I'm after is possible..

solution: 

issue: ghetolay: can I bother you for a moment? 
solution: ghetolay: I am back on the Angular project I was working on and I was left creating this Helper class. Do you see any way of eliminating passing the formbuilder to the static functions ? [<-LINK->]. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] small example of what you could do 
solution: with this one you'd need to make sure to callnewForm()each time, otherwise it would use the form from last time, but you could change it to make it easier.

issue: CamusAran: During runtime? 
solution: I've never done it but I would create a global function that changes the favicon and call that function from Angular.. A global function as in an asset that you reference in you index.html file.. CamusAran: It depends on how you have implemented your function. If it's a global function it should exists on window.. 

issue: Anyone here that has some insights on the the@angular/compiler-cli module? 
solution: mlc-mlapis: Well, I kinda have the feeling that the static code analyzing has a problem with es2015 shorthand object definition or something like that.

solution: 

issue: Is  there a good way to change the text of an angular shell (app.component template) from another component? I have my nav located in the app.component and I want to change the text of a back button in the nav from each component 
solution: mcarson28: ... you don't needofObjectChanged. You can create an observable in your service and your main component subscribes to it in ngOnInit. The service will have a method that any component can call and this method pushesnext(something)on the observable ... All components share the service via DI..

solution: 

issue: anyone have loaded v4 umd modules as externals? 
solution: stephanoapiolaza: Most definitely faster.. mm. The change is brutal. 

issue: What high orders comp give us ? 
solution: However, it\'s not one driven by buttons on a page to add new "x" to the form... it\'ll be "generated" at component initialization.... A-STAR: Lets you "wrap" another component with a "component" that doesn\'t create any dom elements, and passes data into the component it wraps.. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] 
solution: $event.target@amazonalexabot_twitteralways get the child element of DIV. then you have to check parents. slice will return a new array each time that’ll force change detection to pick it up. hungerregnuh: is it better to use slice() or [ ...oldArray ] ?. 

issue: where are you subscribing to the changes in? 
solution: I create the form in the constructor and subscribe there. you may need to subscribe in an afterContentInit or something…@amazonalexabot_twitter. create the form in onInit (not constructor) and subscribe in an afterContentInit. 

issue: does anyone have a suggestion to my problem? 
solution: (blur) gets fired and so the *ngIf evaluates to false. (click) doesn't fire inside the block. right now i got a hackish solution by adding a slight delay on the onBlur() function. it\'s an autocomplete feature, in case you\'re wondering.. I want the "dropdown" list to disappear, when the input field is blurred. 

issue: After creating a form, how can you update a FormControl's required value 
solution: amazonalexabot_twitter: there’s a method called updateValueAndValidity i think. i generally always add it, i ran into one situation where the view didn’t update without it, i don’t recall what made it special though. 

issue: Does anyone know how to simply used the Http COPY method according to [<-LINK->] with angular? 
solution: _xhr.open(RequestMethod[req.method].toUpperCase()You'll have to extendRequestMethodenum as well. ghetolay: thx. i tried usinghttp.requestalready but I didn't extend theRequestMethodenum. That's why I got an error. I'll try that.

solution: 

issue: you can use a template like that? 
solution: formControlName must be used with a parent formGroup directive.  You'll want to add a formGroup\n       directive and pass it an existing FormGroup instance (you can create one in your class).. 

issue: Who can check my first app? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. Ooo I can read some of these words. 

issue: Can anyone explain whether all my h2 tags are rerendered again for each interval? 
solution: Actually I went a bit fast but your original example doesn't re-render all h2 each time since you use string. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: just coming from this sample [<-LINK->]. may be there was some changes in angular since then that affect theoriginalError. kuncevic: instead of using the type, simply have an identifier within your class that tells you what type it is.. 

issue: Is there an easy way to switch a templateUrl of a component (e.g. based on an environment variable)? 
solution: dklmuc: webpack doesn't like imports on dynamic variables but it can be done.  Read up on that critical dependency error and you will find ways to address it.  You have to specify a load context of sorts.  It's been a while since I did it.. 

issue: PardeepKashyap5_twitter: ... ah, OK then. But the fact that Angular usesrouter.navigate(['/campaigns-info'])correctly for switching the context of routing and you can't get  an incoming request on your server .... with PathLocationStrategy (HTML5 history.pushState) should response the server for any unknown resource reqests withindex.html. And all Angular route paths are unknown resources for your server because there is nothing on the server what could be related to them. 
solution: PardeepKashyap5_twitter: ... I just try on my app to test the behavior withPathLocationStrategyand when you manually change URL in a browser + ENTER then URL is used always against a server ... so ashttp://...../yourroute. This  the full apprefreshso everything is reloaded ... and also your server  has the URL. But using normal Angular operations ....navigate(...)Angular router knows what is necessary to load and corresponding ngModule (or related resources) ... is loaded from the server. But the route is not necessary to send to the serverhttp://...../yourroute. So I thing that you will have to re-think the concept of the app's routing and use some other ways how to get necessary data from the server when you switch to the next route. There are resolvers on routes, singleton services,.router.events.subscribe(...), ... and others. All depends on what you exactly want to get and when from your server.. 

issue: is it possible to extend Event and emit it through an EventEmitter? 
solution: 

issue: I have two questions for Angular ? 
solution: mlc-mlapis: yes ....  one for directives  and second for  styling  my components !. I developped components but I don't no when I used components or use directive  !. SkyNetDZ: ... a component has a view and a directive not ... details ... read [<-LINK->]. 

issue: reactive or template driven ? 
solution: then you just keep a reference of each control as a property of your class. and for template driven ?. use the export to get a ref to ngModel / ngModelGroup. 

issue: Can I know whether I should angular2 quickstart or angular cli for building my product 
solution: Right know I have started doing my build with quick start, can you suggest ways to change to cli. derekkite: > Right know I have started doing my build with quick start, can you suggest ways to change to cli. ajomadlabs: It works and there are many many people pounding on it so issues and support is readily available. aot works just fine..

solution: krishandeo: That was already done :-D@broweratcognitecdotcomI was looking for the wrong tag all that time ? Damn me. Thanks@mlc-mlapisI have a contact page that request an array ofContactPersonModeland display them. In the same page, I have aformwhere you must choose the recipient from the same array in anoption select. So I wanted to reuse the same variable to avoid to do the request twice.. 

issue: Is it Possible to call a random function just before every route change 
solution: PardeepKashyap5_twitter: like literally a random function... Or are you saying subscribe to route changes and trigger some other method call.

issue: Hello alli want to learn angular2 is there any necessary to learn angular1 before start to angular2 
solution: No its not neccessary to learn AngularJS first as Angular (2+) is a proper total rewrite with different concepts and leverages typescript. 

issue: import component directly instead of module, correct? ideally, what i am thinking is, module wraps everything, :), thanks 
solution: for example: fileA.ts export interface IA, Component CA, and type TA. then add Component CA in ModuleA(say moduleA.ts) and could use it by importing ModuleA, but then need to import other types(type alias, interface, etc) directly from fileA.ts,. 

issue: How can I change the base url of my http requests at runtime? 
solution: If you are using angular-cli look at environment.ts in two places. derekkite: no. i have a bunch resource endpoints e.g. contacts, sales-orders, purchase-orders etc.. but they are prefixed with the accountId that the user is currently using e.g. /{accountId}/contacts. The user can change which account they are logged into so i need all my http requests to have the new accountId..

solution: 

issue: You're providing both services, right? Likeproviders : [ServiceA, ServiceB] 
solution: 

issue: Hmm angular animations produced the wierdest bugs for me. 
solution: Like using it with setTimeout() causing keyframes issues.. Yeah, for setting a visibility boolean back. Using atransition('* => void')inside a trigger.. 

issue: why is your service provided inside Component ? and not at module ? 
solution: instead of a singleton. so I assume$('.carousel').carousel({ ...})needs to be called after the view is built ?. 

issue: is this code sequential ? 
solution: I call the singleton function from a component. so put the tryToDraw function inside a promise?. JosephSKh: yes. 

issue: How can I make a children component take  a height of parent automaticily 
solution: belst: I drow graph with d3js ..... so my graph depend of size of container. 

issue: Observables are better in almost every situation

issue: Howdy all, does Angular2 cli work on win10 with vis studio15? 
solution: amitdahan: yeah most likely, since it's only the second component that isn't initialised. It's custom-made, but has been working perfectly until the upgrade :/. 

issue: hey@Toxicableor@robwormaldcan you explain the diff between using@HostListenerin a ts file vs just using it in the html dom tree 
solution: no, you can always just inject the ElementRef and use the nativeElement directly. but it depends a lot on what you want to do. 

issue: having trouble doing this with angular animations [<-LINK->] should i just stick with jquery? lol 
solution: but yeah@angular/animations is suitable for that stuff. yeah. but im trying to do it the "angular way" lol.

solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] anyone? 
solution: Scriptmatico: i want to have wrapper component.. BModule is wrapper component for AModule.. but AModule can be used in anywhere too.. not dependent with BModule. 

issue: how else do you add function to a class ? 
solution: well I mean with typescript you wouldnt have to import a method on a class. I dont think you can build "extension" methods per say in typescript can you?. there is proposal but nothing yet. 

issue: does your service have dependencies ? what you said works too 
solution: problem with my gist is I don't keep them up to date. 

issue: can you do + caseId + ? 
solution: 

issue: Morning all! 
solution: No, a component will always have a host element. But you can make the selector anything, so you could have it bebutton[myCmp]and match<button myCmp>.

issue: hey guys can anyone expert in angular js here? 
solution: Not the angular js forum.. 

issue: So, I have two projects, same version of angular, same version of rxjs.  One of the projects has the .takeWhile method on an observable while the other doesn't. I can't figure out why :'( 
solution: 

issue: best way to learn -> go thru the docs :D or the sourcecode 
solution: i learnt A LOT going thru the implementations in Common module. 

issue: useget() 
solution: in your snippet you just need to replace 0 with count. orderForm.get(['orderLinesForm', count, 'olReference' + count]). 

issue: Hi All, can we give local variable for each row in *ngFor loop? 
solution: Or I think I can get@ViewChild(SaElementComponenet) items: QueryList<SaElementComponent>;. 

issue: which plunkr? 
solution: The way I see it:First off you're going about this all wrong, use reactive/immutable principales and you'' eliminate all these issuesThe object is passed down by ref, ie, it's not cloned and both childs have the same object. Therefore, when you edit it in one component it changes the object backing both components, also when you edit it you casue CD which makes Angular check the object agasint the view.The reason why ngOnchanges isn't being fired is becasue the parent isn't actually passing down a new ref, you can see this happening here [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Angular /= angularjs 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. Rado is a master of types.. 

issue: Hey can anyone help me understand the difference betweenChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck()anddetectChanges() 
solution:

issue: When using aglobalservice like a breadcrumb service, is there any way to avoid having to inject it into each components constructor? 
solution: And if I wanted to include it in a component in a different module, is there less rigid way to import it than supplying an relative path like../../core/breadcrumb?. trentrand: you can use barrels if you want, but you can sometimes casue issues with barrels. 

issue: How do I run my App without making it "WATCH" my files ? 
solution: 

issue: do you have any projects you could link to? I've only been doing this 2-3 years so it's enough for me getting to grips with the tech still also I wonder... somehow instinctively I prefer Angular to React, but are there things you can do with Angular that React just couldn't do? 
solution: I think angular is better for maintainability and general every day use... and has stuff like the SPA framework built in, where react seems to use diff frameworks to fascilitate it. 

issue: Hi Does the Depenedency Injection pattern is a way to follow the Singleton pattern .... Just Curious 
solution: but otherwise yes. if you provide it more than once in modules you get the last created one when you inject it. 

issue: Is here any export for Angular 2 animations? 
solution: Yes, I understeand basics.I have been told only thing to edit DOM must be Angular so its fast (if I use jquery, its not good idea).Imagine mobile application with left menu. YOu can scroll up and down using finger. Once you swipe, it doesnt stop instaltly. Its slowly stopping.Is there any way to do this slowly stopping in angular?I tried to, but I dont know how. I cant do translateX + 150px, I cant parse variables.How would you do it?. 

issue: can I use component inline style? like this: [<-CODE->] 
solution: I got it working with [style]="". benydc: better use[style.display]="arVisible". 

issue: Is the Declarations really necessary? Wouldn't Imports be enough? Not clear to me why the latter wouldn't suffice. 
solution: is it, like, declarations just introduce a name, while import actually does loading and stuff?.

issue: guys i wan to pass data from one component to another while routing , ny idea how can we do it? 
solution: 

issue: Quick question... do you guys prefer using EventEmitter or Observable for emitting events outside of a component? 
solution: for real stuff, I almost always end up with observables instead.

solution: mikerhyssmith: ...*.TSfiles are source files that are transpiled to*.JSand they not required in any way in a browser for runtime so there has to be a config problem with webpack certainly if those are parts of bundles actually. I am not using webpack so I can't help with..

solution: Mohendran: services aren’t a special way of doing things… that is the Angular way… ngrx/store brings Redux to the mix… but if you’re not doing that, then just implement an Angular App… checkout angular.io… go through the tutorial, look at the style guide, and read up on services. 

issue: for an angular unit test, can you inject in a beforeEach?

issue: Hey guys which database should i use with angualar 2?? 
solution: Nitin96Bisht: angular2 is front end tech, database is backend. Nitin96Bisht: angular can’t talk directly to a server side database, it has to go via a server side language such as node, php, .net, java, ruby etc.. so your question doesn’t make sense.

issue: I like the httpmodule of angular with obervable. Is it possible to use it in a node js project to make http call? 
solution: stavn1: you probably can, but you'd need to bring things like@angular/core. It would be easier to just crate a wrapper around the existing libs in node. stavn1: @angular/platform-server is your friend, it imports httpmodule off the bat. Mostly used for universal apps (server side rendering), but you can use for whatever you want. 

issue: does anyone use yarn over npm? 
solution:  [<-LINK->] ... I think I remembered wrong, I had the issue because one of my modules was using another version of angular ( 2 against 4). I also had the same issue you are having with npm and that was solved by removing package-lock.json and node_modules and it eventually worked. I can't be much more of an help than that.

solution: cedvdb: Yes. 

issue: I'm not really getting any reaction to my issue. Are there other angular communities? Maybe with focus on ngrx? 
solution: 

issue: APP_INITIALIZER can only be used on eager load modules. what is the equivalent on lazy load modules? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] is pretty cool, can we use it with any service worker, or must use angular service worker? guess i'll find out this evening when i try it out 
solution: 

issue: postman is techinically a "server" request not a browser request 
solution: 

issue: theatrain: lazy loading is primarily to speed up the initial startup. Once you are started, you can preload modules that are needed. 
solution: derekkite: the issue i hit was that i tried to create a ModalManagerService at the AppModule level. The purpose of this service was to manage a modal stack and have the ability to close all current modal windows in case the user changes the route etc… So i put the ngb modal service in there and pass in the components that I wanted to be opened in a modal. 

issue: what "leak" is this? memory or info? 
solution: notsonotso: was in pen-testing mode. 

issue: Hello guys, I had a quick questions, is it possible to make the currency pipe silent 
solution: cause I am having some variables that have chances of having values like N/A and when it goes into number pipe it just throws errorPS: by slient I mean errors pass silently. notsonotso: So here is the thingI have a page called portfolio report which shows how your portfolio is performing, if the portfolio is new then it happens that there is no way to calculate certain metrics for certain fields and in that case it must be shown as N/A but now these any  goes to currency pipe and there is no way I can validate it because there are lot of fields like that, so I want to do it at pipe level since it would prevent me to put if else at so many places.

issue: I'm having trouble understanding Angular 1 vs 2. The docs still show angular 1.5.5 ( [<-LINK->] ) but I thought Angular 2 was in use now? 
solution: MovieSliceApp_twitter: Angular2 is just called Angular (and is version 4 now already)... I wouldn't know any reason starting a new project with Angular JS (besides time if you got experienced AngularJS developers and need to hurry). If you start new in Angular/AngularJS I would chose Angular as we did 8 months ago. 

issue: I'm deeply in love with Angular 2. Is that wrong? 
solution: he did more in five months than I do in five years. 

issue: Toxicable: So what does " ng build --prod " do?

issue: is it possible to exclude 1 .ts file from bundling and just compile it to .js? 
solution: estradamarkie: What are you trying to do ? Remember, excluding it from both webpack and angularcli is only neccesary if you are importing the file (or explicitly including it in your webpack/angular cli config). If you exclude it, you\'ll have to compile your ts to js in a different way as webpack will not compile it for you. Another possibility would be to use code splitting to split out that single file into it\'s own "bundle" but keep everything in webpack/angularcli (but that\'s probably not neccesary in your case).. 

issue: Angular team, while not on your direct roadmap. Is there any information describing the possibilities of using Web Assembly?

issue: is there some npm package for bootstrap? like ngx-bootstarp? 
solution: there is one like ngx-bootstrap as well but i've been using material lately so. 

issue: Hey, I have a quick question about i18n: What do you prefer and why? Angular's out of the box i18n or ngx-translate? 
solution: taigi100: with angulars i18n you will have got one bundle for each language, because it will be replace the string on build time. with ngx-bootstrap it's more dynamic (but also working with AoT). taigi100: not directly... since they added a stream method() to get a translation as observable most usecases were working as expected. it was more trickier to get the DatePipe switching the formatting on language switches. 

issue: ghetolay: neat I didn't know about ng-container. Why doesn't it come up when I search for it in the docs? 
solution: it basically just allows you to use things like structural directives without adding another dom ndoe. 

issue: why havn't we something simple in js to works with immutable [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: by the way the rooms variable here is a constant , what if I want to roll it back? what's the most efficient way to do that? 
solution: i mean i want to reset the values of rooms to what it used to be. I mean nothing here keeps the value of rooms aside from the outer most observable. 

issue: Hi, what's the correct way to get an element width without accessing thenativeElementproperty ofElementRef?

issue: Who uses angular for new project? 
solution: Like big names. big companies.

solution: Also angular has a bunch of other integrations that i like... 

issue: Hey guys, does anyone know, How can I use patchValue in FormArray when I dont know in advance the size of the array and how many controls to push?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: kumar-utsav: you would need an array of objects. patchvalue will loose match the object properties of your data and the formgroup, but arrays have to match. derekkite: yes I have an array of objects with 3 items...and I am generating a form dynamically, my use case is, based on the number of objects in array...I have to push the same number of controls in an empty FormArray with their values. 

issue: So what is the problem? implements? but why do you need it? 
solution: You probably want that to be an interface so you can swap it out later, right?. you swap it by providing a different service, not by changing interfaces. 

issue: How do I clear a typed array? 
solution: if you set the array to type any does it have empty?. I guess you'll just have to manually set it to and empty away myarray = [];. 

issue: Is there a plan to have ngrx part of angular framework? 
solution: e3d: i have actively avoid merging ngrx into angular itself. its operating at a higher level than the framework. e3d: yep. i recently changed my role at google slightly to be able to dedicate more time to ngrx, as we're using it more internally now..

issue: How many different SharedModules can a single app potentially have? one? one per feature? something else? 
solution: derekkite: I can see a functional distinction between SharedModules and feature modules, routing modules, and app modules, but not "etc". Without a formal distinction of some form - exactly only one of these per application, one per feature or whatever - SharedModules seem tobethe EtcModules. I\'m looking at examples that have both modules named "SharedModule" and other etc modules not named "SharedModule" and that gives the impression that there\'s something special about the former, but it seems to just be the leftovers that couldn\'t be grouped in a descriptive container. I think one good way to group things would be based on performance considerations, but I haven\'t reached the point in this to know how that would go. Packaging objects isn\'t new to Angular. Seems lessons from other things could be applied.. 

issue: can anyone help out when why this won’t work? [<-CODE->] appreciated 
solution: AaronHood: well, the class is set to the div that has the var’s variable when the page refreshes but when i toggle, it won’t set the class anymore.

issue: is there a way to prevent 'ng serve' from trying to monitor for file changes? 
solution: 

issue: you can redirect inside a guard 
solution: canActivate could return an alternate path as a string to the router, or we could have a designated fall back for each guard. I feel like this information belongs in the router, not the guard. mildfuzz: return a string would be weird imo but defining an url at the route level could make sense. 

issue: jquery? 
solution: notsonotso: yes. That is another way of doing it..... notsonotso: grins hard. Include Jake Weary with rel="prefetech" on the script tag.. dewwwald:  [<-LINK->] but you have 0% Jake Weary skillz.

issue: Hi, is there any way to detect no router change? I mean situation when user click the same routerLink he is allready in i would like to implement some monkeyPatch for forcing angular 4 router to reinitialize route 
solution: mlc-mlapis: i think you are wrogn or we don\'t understand each other. Let\'s assume you have navigation menu on the left, and router outlet on the right. In navigation menu you click "products" and you get the list of products on the right, you click again products on the menu and nothing changes, becase there wasn no route change, but when you click on another link in navigation menu and then go back to products, you se the neewest (refreshed one) list. 

issue: what is the best way to learn angular ? 
solution: vattytrivedi: The angular docs and practice :). vattytrivedi: shortest way from noob to good these days is the Udemy course on ng4 if you can afford it. I hear it's stellar.. As in "the-best-course-ever-made" good. 

issue: Any idea how to navigate back without considering queryParams changes? 
solution: artall64: when you click on one item it runs CD it checks every single component from top to bottom. 

issue: Hi all,Does anybody have example code for how to create a component library for Angular ?  Ideally I would like to create a library for my components where the view code is not embeded within the component source i.e. remains in separate HTML filesIt would also be good to be able to have a test site that can be run up from the component library to view the created components. 
solution: @mlc-mlapis I understand that, but when coding the components in my library I need to write the HTML view.  It seems easier to do this in native HTML files, as I can use HTML editing tools when writing the code.  It also seems easier to read the source code of the library.I have no issue with the built version of the library embededing the HTML into the component, just want the original typescript and HTML seperate.  My understanding is that it is possible to achive this via a gulp script, was just looking for a working example..

issue: @bastiankhalil ... and where is the directive? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: How is this implementing the subscription? it seems more like it's implementing the sequence 
solution: 

issue: can someone please explain to me the reason why Angular requires every component to be included in a module, when in React (for example) you can just import a component and simply use it? 
solution: 

issue: so build it :P 
solution: yeah man. I wonder why the angular source doesn't use TypeScript namespaces for internal modularization. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: sarunint: ... there should be something wrong because it is normal that you fetch data later from a server and then usingsetValueorpatchValueto update the form model.. mlc-mlapis: I mean that the data will say something like "There are 2 checkboxes, a textbox, and a radio group with 3 choices". 

issue: Sorry guys i have a dtarter question 
solution: No as you see even worse. 

issue: hi everybody i have a question i have to process big data with javascript, but chrome crash everytime maybe i resolve this with php ? :D 
solution: 

issue: Hi! Can someone check this question out? [<-LINK->] Thanks a lot in advance! :) 
solution: lexcaraig: - Usually you would set some additional variable (e.x. 'selectedItem') on your component and this is displayed outside of your*ngForloop.  Maybe you would initialise 'selectedItem' to the first item in your array initially in your component, and then based on some user interaction or event, you would call a function on your component where you pass in one item and then you would updateselectedItemwhich would update this outside the for loop..

issue: is there any way to set routes dynamically? or only one time binding is allowed to set routes at the beginning?

When I get the response from the server after adding a user, I want to reset the form so I have : [<-CODE->] And the form is reset BUT material shows my input in red because form is still marked as "touched".

issue: Good morning...can someone help me review a simple rxJS message service I wrote...I would like to make sure I'm not doing things like a n00b :/ 
solution: 

issue: is there any open source big project built in angular 2? someone told me there is no big app built in angular 2 so, i was curious about it 
solution: ankur1163: ... for something big you have to wait ... there are hundreds ot thousands projects (some picked for example here [<-LINK->] ) but it takes some time to organize and establish the base. Commercial and private projects are much faster ... [<-LINK->] .. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] why can't i do this? 
solution: syaing Property 'subscribe' does not exist on type 'MyObj[]'.. 

issue: how messed up is it to have bootstrap AND material installed? 
solution: still can't believe neither have a date AND time picker. 

issue: apart from papa parse being able to handle file elements, do you get to your 'parsing comlete' log? 
solution: i think the google chart component try to loads the chart at the begging and when i load the parsed data don't redraw it or something like that. 

issue: is ngrx worth the extra layer of complexity? 
solution: I personally don't use it though, since I use firebase, all of my state apart from state such as Forms is sync straight to the DB. 

issue: can a directive use a service? 
solution: I think my mind expanded.... more ideas coming in. I have a great example but need some help... a currency directive... you can put in dollar signs (us amercians) and commas but when I get the model value it's only a number value. 

issue: morning angular folks

solution: 

issue: It’s normal have an service that provides HTML blocks to insert into .component.html ? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-ISSUE->] is just sad 
solution: this is an absolutely huge app, still...  a build system shouldn't need this amount of memory. 

issue: Hey guys has anyone run into an issue where ngStyle works on everything except for height? Here's my code: [<-CODE->]

issue: Excuse me?How to automatically calculate the results after filling out the data in the angular 
solution: 

issue: and it's true. This is what the angular team used as a model: [<-LINK->] 
solution: He's right, I was merely trying to remember the source code, but looking at it, there is a type definition in the input for async pipe for event emitter, but it errors if it's passed. 

issue: My component'sngOnInitmethod gets called but myngAfterViewInitisn't getting called even if I empty out the entire template of my component. Did anyone experience this? 
solution: 

issue: Is this a good place for n00b questions? 
solution: I have a question about 2 way data Binding. I believe it might be related to the fact that my variable name is camel case.This works fine:<app-service-list [selectedService]="parentSelectedService" (selectedServiceChange) = "parentSelectedService = $event">But I would expect it this one to work as well:<app-service-list ([selectedService])="parentSelectedService">According to docs below they should be the same: https://angular.io/guide/template-syntax#two-way-binding---. 

issue: But why?  Why do anything clever with instantiation?  Why override dependencies at runtime instead of compile time?  These sound contrived 
solution: 

issue: safe navigation operator inputOfSomething?.deeply?.nested?.state why don't you use the async pipe ? 
solution: 

issue: hi is it possible map exception JSON fromObservable.throwto a exception class? here is my code  [<-LINK->] 
solution: PerfectPixel: well this is the execption I get from the server"Execution exception[[UserLoginException: Wrong credentials [1]]]”and I would like to create a class for this and map it in the error response, so I can call it in my view.

solution: I have a small issue with styling. broweratcognitecdotcom: I have created a plunkr. 

issue: any one please: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: async pipe works for eventEmitters? 
solution: EventEmitters should be used for@Output. EventEmitters should be used for @Outputonly. Toxicable: has spoke.. "ONLY" ;). 

issue: Can anyone help me with this? [<-LINK->] 
solution:  [<-LINK->] @arun-awnics. 

issue: i think it was@Toxicable?? who said never use jquery with angular?? 
solution: tons of great plugins out there, if you don't have time to rewrite them, use them. But I probably mean, you don't need to use jQuery with angular. 

issue: Hi i'm new to Angular and have problem to even start it not mentioning using and learnig :( 
solution: 

issue: I had a similar issue and ended up wrapping the svg in a container that held the class 
solution: yeah, at least If that bind is done on a .html fileattr.classseems to not be working either... 

issue: Hey all :) 
solution: alxhub: So I think i’ve finally decided to the API for that IterableChanges -> DOM syncer thing [<-LINK->] any opinions?. Note: still not tests or docs. i'd have to see the source of your pipe,@BustyLoli-Chan. 

issue: how can i put this in the subscribe? 
solution: rsteuber: Just like you assigned the value in the subscribe, put your logic in there instead. you can do more than single statements by putting a {} block in there. You're already creating an arrow function, but by omitting the curly braces, you're making it a single line function. Add curly braces and it becomes a normal arrow function. 

issue: you teach designers angular ? 
solution: but more seriously, that's not angular specific. It general UX design, don't reinvent the wheel. Use interface element that people already know how to use, etc. At one point the designer pulled out his mobile phone so he could show me an app that has 2 round buttons floatig at the bottom of the list. i asked him to enter data into the bottom item with a sifficient length that it would be covered by the buttons. He did it. You could not read the content behind the buttons.. 

issue: hey everyone, can someone point me to a description of how the Angular API docs are built, and how i can contribute there? 
solution: PatrickLehner: there isn’t any docs on that sorryHowever, the API docs are done via js-doc I think it’s called. 

issue: inspect it and see what is overriding it 
solution: It was weird, nothing was overiding it, i have aposition: fixedand height 100 width 100 on a webgl element... I changed the z-index to -100, and then it worked. 

issue: Just sharing about his article, any thoughts? [<-LINK->] 
solution: if oyu want things to go faster. Ranked by difficulty from easy to hardestuse trackBy with any ngFor (this is whta you should be doing anyway)\nuse OnPush\nRun things outside of Angular’s zone. 

issue: who worked with firebase? 
solution: 

issue: Does anybody have any good resources to help with creating an angular library? 
solution: 

issue: + no runtime overhead on interfaces, right? 
solution: right, but there's not a whole lot of runtime overhead with a class either. @ContentChildren(MyTagDirective) chips: QueryList<MyTagDirective>;works for just getting the directive, but then it isn't associate with the chip. 

issue: import the Router 
solution: import { RouterModule } from '@angular/router';its not the router. import { Router,  RouterModule } from'@angular/router';. import { RouterModule, Router } from'@angular/router';. 

issue: For you, this logger should be used by the framework and our applications ? 
solution: of course ;) but why it should be shakable if the core module use it in internal ?. That's another issue I haven't figured out. But it should still be for people who have rolled their own or just don't want it. 

issue: oooh, sounds like i should get some popcorn ready… lunch time show? 
solution: 

issue: lol@ericmartinezri wonder if we were thinking the same thing :D rather, same person 
solution: was he a helpful dick as well?. hahaha, dat edit. 

issue: now you peaked my interest 
solution: Actually, it would've worked rather well to sync part of the Firebase tree. first one to provide one gets a gold star. 

issue: what is this "92% chunk asset optimization"? it is very very slow 
solution: pantonis: you use aot  in dev ?. 

issue: Hey folks, wanted to ask before we start implementing i18n into application, is the Angular offering stabilized or is there another preferred solution? 
solution: jgornick: yes... the angular way is a complex workflow with i18n translation files and multiple language bundles in the end, the ngx-translate way is a simple key:value approach with one bundle and live switch in the end. 

issue: Does Angular CLI install SASS when creating a project? 
solution: 

issue: so do MutationObservers actually work or what 
solution: for reals? I need to detect when a dom node is destroyed. you have angular. 

issue: Hello guys !I'm wondering about the ngClass uses. [<-CODE->] And in my component I want to say if colorSubtitle exists so you apply it value at the element in question.This is my try, but it doesn't work: [<-CODE->] Anyidea how to do that ? :) thank you 
solution: 

issue: what is your router config? 
solution: 

issue: recommended angular app hosting option? 
solution: ^ this is what I use, not that im a great example but anyways.It’s also a CDN as I mentioned above is a good option. 

issue: good night, im switching off :) 
solution: 

issue: EreckGordon: actually i believe@alxhuband david east were working on this exact thing 
solution: 

issue: someone else noticed that the initial navigation event is gone? 
solution: 

issue: I feel like by now I should have a solid approach to rooting out "No provider for..." errors. I don\'t yet. Any suggestions? 
solution: ronnyek: well, my first crack is to import into the module that declares the component that needs the provider the module in whose provider list the missing service is listed, but this sentence is so convoluted and it doesn't work so at all that there's gotta be a better way. 

issue: output? 
solution: 

issue: what if Observable is in a service and the service triggers the http call that should call next() on the observable. Would CD start at the root component and work its way down? 
solution: ghetolay: i have subscribers in two components both have functionalities that cause BehaviouralSubject.next(), everything seems to work with component1 but not with component 2. 

issue: is there a way to set a parameter in a child component? array of type Ix 
solution: 

issue: I have to learn Angular2 in 3 hours from scratch. Any help? 
solution: 

issue: How to differentiate when page loaded from back button or from routerLink/route navigation? 
solution: bobrosoft: for the login case it’s solved using route guard@CanActivate. This is another case, when press back button simply load from cache since if from router link will get data from server.. bobrosoft: let say i have list of products loaded from server (table), then click an item to view the detail (route navigate). When i press back button to get back to list, i could just load the previous list from local cache rather than loaded again from server.. 

issue: even if he felt otherwise, you left him with only one acceptable answer in a public forum ;) 
solution: 

issue: what's cool? 
solution: 

issue: madblkman: - If there server does not allow cross origin or JSONP, you will have to call to an actual server first, which then calls the api. 
solution: mrusful: I highly doubt thatResponse to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.would be a malformed request.. because Chrome, and other browsers, require the server to have the header set to allow cross origin requests in order to thwart xss attacks. [<-LINK->]. 

issue: this happens on an enum that's pretty much empty [<-CODE->] And it just started happening, has anyone upgraded/broke anything recently? 
solution: dancancro: had a look around. most google projects tend to co-locate their specs. 

issue: is there a way to view how your app is setup, what belongs to what? 
solution: hungerregnuh: it would be better if it were in my IDE aye? Instead of a resulting product I think. But I will give it a shot..

issue: anyone using the textMask module? 
solution: I am trying to create a 4 digit mask with - placeholders. it’s work fine but after I tap anywhere, a - is added at the end of 4 digit number. 

issue: DefinitelyTyped's issue backlog is becoming rather brutal :( getting lots of problems lately with outdated typings some (non)issues more amusing than others... [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: AaronHood: well, it makes sense from a business point of view. They don't want their 50 million investment on frameworks to build facebook, to be used to build another facebook.. 

issue: I didn’t realise how much extra code you have to write in a client + api + relational db setup 
solution: Toxicable: yeah, man i moved a project just now from Knex/Bookshelf to firebase. 

issue: yes, we're discussing this right now as part of a larger effort for reactive/immutable angular 
solution: robwormald: that effort... does it include discussing the possibility of ngrx-store   backends... like firebase?. 

issue: Do many people ride motorbikes there?

solution: amazonalexabot_twitter: wonders what it's like to live in Mountain View. 

issue:  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] 
solution: can't use this in static functions. also, the code is unreachable. 

issue: who is this guy? [<-LINK->] alxhub: 
solution: Hahaha. Jeff used to be on the Angular team, along with Victor Savkin.. 

issue: Do you have a repo for it by any chance? 
solution: Sounds like an issue on your side to be honest mate. 

issue: what kind of inject fest are you having? 
solution: but nothing wrong with having lots of injections. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: megazoor: You're assigning it a type. yeah just checks to see if the token is still valid. 

issue: with/deep/being deprecated is there a decent way to implement a similar functionality for future use? 
solution: 

issue: is there a way to add an attribute directive to an element programatically? I know one can instantiate components programatically with component factory 
solution: I think the solution to my problem is some sort of template outlet where we swap out template based on string provided just have a seperate template for each possible loc string. 

issue: What is it? 
solution: 

issue: How do you append a validator? I'm stuck on this 
solution: you cant. argh. I need to do something like this. 

issue: I\'m looking at this map on angular.io under "loved by millions". Where is New Zealand? 
solution: I think this needs a Issue, might even have to mark it as a regression. 

issue: hi! i would need some feedback on this [<-LINK->] . thanks in advance! 
solution: Toxicable: I think that's not possible because it's hard to detect if click was inside the same component if there is not only input field but also button which must keep dropdown opened when clicked - if I would bind blur on input this would surely close dropdown after the button would be clicked. 

issue: any ideas on this one [<-LINK->] ? 
solution: I have an issue with a barrels not serevices :). @kuncevic usually this means you're re-importing from an entry pointso if you have/feature/index/feature/a/feature/bnothing inside of feature should import from index. 

issue: ease dropping on convo@alxhub@Toxicable is this for the httpclient? 
solution: i was going to start converting to new client this week, including an uploading service.

solution: 

issue: Im new with ngrx, Is it possible to use ngrx/store to create a State Machine Workflow? 
solution: Spawnrad afaik you would store your state in the store, the machine part would act on it separately, but it is very possible.. 

issue: anyone here? 
solution: But when i swap the date and the string is placed in right place  also stays with the old value and change the string position. If is in right place i don't want to move it, but i think i'm not pointing to the same array or something else. 

issue: this guy deserves a ban :)

issue: Hi Guys, anybody here who has successfully updated the universal-starter project from 2.x to 4.x? 
solution: Toxicable: once event recieved at parent, then processed , then how can I return it back to child, which is emitted through@Output(). 

issue: what is the latest stable version of angular 4? 
solution: You have to call this.changeRef.detectChanges(); manually to update a template, if the variable is updated delayed by a promise or callback.. 

issue: Hey guys, looking for an angular carousel to use in my project. Any recommendations? 
solution: looking for something pure angular4 (typescript). msandeeprao38: should be easy enough to make one from scratch though, sounds like a fun experiment. Just some ease-out animations between images ;). 

issue: is there a way to find usage statistics on angular? I think it should be called bermuda 
solution: angular of course... I have 1 built at work, 3 built at home etc.. 

issue: Anyone explain how to handle responsive animations? or at least tell me it's not implemented? 
solution: 

issue: sooo anyone happen to know howAnimationBuilderworks? 
solution: He shows up sometimes.. Usually when I poke him and tell him someone on Gitter has an animations question.. 

issue: Are the js files in the same folder as the index.html? 
solution: Looks like they come back as status 200 rather weirdly. Clicking the lego image, removes one /tienda form the URL lol.

solution: 

issue: A service? 
solution: 

issue: When is Angular 14 planned for release? 
solution: steveblue: 4 years from now. somewhere around there. 

issue: I'm trying to use TemplateRef, but I'm getting a message from typescript that TemplateRef requires a type, but I don't know what sort of type it's expecting? I'm passing <any>, but I kinda wanna know what it should be getting? 
solution: for example when you do ngFor*ngFor="let item of items; let i = index"here we haveitemandindexboth exist on the context of the Template Refhowever item is actually $implicit which is a slightly more special part of the contextbutindexis justcontext.index. 

issue: yawn, sup 
solution: notsonotso: I've given up on thewt  carousel for nowand mods on /r/anguar2 are being stubborn. notsonotso: they havn't replied here and since the large majority of people want to have the subs merged means that they wont do it. 

issue: why wouldn’t it be? there’s an angular prject now that wraps some store api i’m drawing a blank on both lol  [<-LINK->] 
solution: that could be problematic - if you’re concerned about that, there’s also the angular universal project which will solve that problem. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] @Input and @Output are super confusing, they took me a while to get used to ... 
solution: it would be much nicer if I could just change it one location and have that propagate to the rest of the applicationthis isn't a complicated issue but I haven't found wherever the angular docs talk about it. 

issue: I have [<-CODE->] because of getToken being asynchronous this doesn't work. what's the solution? 
solution: fhdhsni: Be sure to have a look at angularfire2 if you're integrating firebase with angular: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: can I do an ngFor in reverse? eg, newest pushed element in an array at the top? 
solution: Toxicable: makes sense... instead of pushing an item to an array, I guess I can merge the array onto the new element. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] how do i set a local template name for each result? 
solution: syndesis: if you want a specific set of html for each item then make a specific set of html for each item, if there’s nothign to repeat then I don’t see how you can write any less. 

issue: Hmmmmm....I have an@OutputEventEmitter, but need to check to see if it has any subscriptions...? Possible? 
solution: Toxicable: I have a situation where I do not want someone setting 2 things at once...Specifically, it's a button component... it can have EITHER an onClick (EventEmitter) assigned, or it can be a submit button (where it will relay it's click to the parent form for submision) - but should never have both. 

issue: Hello guys, I am new to angular and now I am wondering.If I want to create a model likeUser()that I can instantiate withnew:Is there a naming convention (like services: users.services.ts)?Should I use a special folder? 
solution: Is there a real difference in angular between model and class?I mean by architecture?Cause I found in the docshero.model.tsinsteadhero.ts.Is this only for readability or is there something I should keep in mind?. 

issue: Can anyone tell me why the following code doesn't work like I expect it to? [<-CODE->] 
solution:

issue: so can we no longer call.map(...)on HttpClient calls? 
solution: which is what 99% of http#get#map's do :). When I plugged it up the compile complained at me, adding the import to the operator specifically made it go away. 

issue: hi, i have a question:how can I check if a  class is a component? if it has associated template? 
solution: yes, but, image i am reciving an interface and i need to check if its implementator is component or not. 

issue: what is it? :O 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] what's the best way to implement this? for each record a radio? 
solution: also it would be great ifng buildwould somehow give you the hash used. then you could pass it as an arg to your prerender script. Sadly that's a build overall hash.

solution: rohitsodhia: that’s coolI for one like helping people with most of the problems that come through hereSince im actually a uni student I don’t really have time to dedicate myself towards a full sized project so working on smaller things is a nice way to keep learning. 

issue: "does not work" meaning ? 
solution: const p = (new HttpParams()).append('id', '10');Does this work@iFarmGolems?. Construct a new body with an appended value for the given parameter name.. 

issue: Come claim your bounty! [<-LINK->] and help me out at the same time 
solution: chrillewoodz: I don't have time to dig through a bunch of random code to figure out how it's hooked up, sorry.. 

issue: Whoa is that the new universal-rendering thing? ;) is there a problem with it? 
solution: FrozenPandaz: it is! Whoever wrote it did an awesome job.. 

issue: hi, can someone explain me what doesplatformBrowserDynamicdo? 
solution: amitmtrn: bootstrap and run your application with uncompiled files. uncompiled by Angular I mean not ts. 

issue: Can we see some code? Perhaps this will shine some light on the matter 
solution: and you should be emitting events, generally, rather than passing down functions, but that's not your biggest problem. 

issue: Guys, In angular4 what is there for templating ? 
solution: Yeah, Angular. angular4. 

issue: .net? 
solution: 

issue: how to use component from another module? as a child 
solution: 

issue: any idea? 
solution: 

issue: why not just run the JS yourself? script tags are html tags 
solution: The value of javascriptIncludes looks like this:. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] ? 
solution: roxcity: or do you importXYZModuleas well in other modules? then you can changeimports: [ XYZModule ]toexports: [ XYZModule ]. This will make the components fromABCModuleavailable in all modules that importXYZModule. gerhardboer: Suppose Acomponent is a whole page & Xcomponent from XYZModule represents another whole page. Before I import ABCModule, when i navigate to XYZModule, Xcomponent shows up which is correct. And when I import ABCModule in XYZModule Acomponent shows up when i navigate to XYZModule.. 

issue: I found out that the problem I was having was actually a layer deeper. My service: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: I put breakpoints at every line ingetTs()and put a watch onresponse, which is how I know thatresponseremains undefined the entire time.. 

issue: Do you guys have ide which extract interface from an implemented class? 
solution: I have component I just want create interface from this component. 

issue: How do I track down what's slowing down the responsiveness of my Angular 4 application? 
solution: Lareolan: the slowness is most likely due to network latency.  And that stuff happens in a service usually.. 

issue: Quick question: shouldngOnInit()work with promised data? 
solution: 

issue: Isn't this what you want? [<-ISSUE->] (if it isn't, just ignore me :P) 
solution: Yeah, I should've tried that before asking. But was just trying to wrap my mind around it, I haven't noticed this pattern before. Thanks@robwormald!. 

issue: Hi guys!How to upgrade Angularjs 1.4.5 Visual Studio app to angular 4.3.1.is that possible? 
solution: SufyanRamzan: You'll probably want to be using 1.5.x and use a component based approach for 'easier' upgrading using ngUpgrade.. 

issue: Does an angular component have any sort of unique ID? 
solution: I need each instance of this component to have a unique id. I've tried to bring lodash in to use _.uniqueid() but i could not get it to build.. 

issue: I have a reactive form in ngFor loop. How to get multiple instances of formgroup for every loop? 
solution: Toxicable: Each form has button to submit the text entered. Currently since the same form group is applied for all the loops. Entering a text on any input activates the submit button in all the forms. Toxicable: One way i could do is make the form fields as a component and loop the component. But i am not convinced by this approach. 

issue: Has any of you used the HttpInterceptors in Angular 4? Currently using the default docs: [<-LINK->] But it's not working 
solution: I thought a component that was  presented in a<router-outlet>would always be destroyed when another component over layed it  but , I'm seeing that is not the case or I have something holding the component in memory?is it normal to have a component instance be re-used?I know when you recall the same route it is re-used but I am not doing that. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: SufyanRamzan:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Then what is the solution for developing ui like Bootstrap? 
solution: the core of bootstrap  itself is a css lib not a js lib. but as above there are many other UI libs built with Angular. 

issue: Anyone have a nice resource on routing with nested routes? The angular.io docs are frustrating and im only finding depricated tutorials 
solution: 

issue: What is the best way to handle User Login and Password on Angular ? 
solution: lostllama: Well keeping some sites from the user who does not have privileges can be tricky if ones knows basic JS because you can easily just manipulate the code and then get access... So I need a fool proof way of handling that scenario.@broweratcognitecdotcomI mean if you send a password with JS it would be really easy to see and manipulate. Even wireShark would be able to pick up the package sent ot the server containing username and password ?". 

issue: Oh, I wanted to ask... is it common for AOT compilation errors to indicate they're on a line different from where they are in the file? 
solution: 

issue: is there a plunk for using HttpClient 
solution: You want the guide: [<-LINK->]. In general, the guides are far better for getting you started, then use the docs to help figure out nitty-gritty details. 

issue: Guys this is bad practice? [<-CODE->] on html ? 
solution: BustyLoli-Chan: i use it for focusing on an input (search) box. but had to run cdRef.detechChanges() so maybe i misused it too. EreckGordon: , yes I notice that, but I need something like this / subscribe, because the data needs to observe the state of the application.. 

issue: is there a way to do this in the html?$observable | async === 1 
solution: 

issue: I'm having a little confusion subscribing to an observable 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] how do I refactor this? 
solution: but, seriously, I think: [<-CODE->]. 

issue: is there any public api ? 
solution: I had one the other day that let you set the response. well or any other json in fact. 

issue: the reason why this stuff failed, is because I have a DatePipe inside another condition afterwards for loading. But the Date is regarded as Invalid in Safari 
solution: because we need a T instead of the space. We're using a PHP API and if you json_encode a Date object, that's the format it gives. 

issue: how would I track down why the html doesn't display on the component 
solution: 

issue: Guys, Angular have any filter pipe? 
solution: Tried this but i'm stuck: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: hi, could someone please help to understand what is wrong with this plnkr? [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Heh, I prefer Belgian special beers Y u no scss? 
solution: doesnt change the fact that the damn bounding box is an insolent bastard, and i keep not learning css; i guess its so i have something to loathe.. 

issue: how long did you plan to spam it ? 
solution: So, your point is? Now back the hell off and go do something useful.. 

issue: hi, could someone please help me to understand why when I click the "recaptha" button doesn\'t trigger my alert? [<-LINK->] thank you 
solution: masber_twitter: ...<button (click)="verifyCallback(\'test\')">recaptcha</button>. 

issue: have you tried inspecting the html in the browser? 
solution: i didn't know that... i've always removed app- haha. 

issue: whats the hip thing to do nowadays that is the analog ofangular.copyfrom the beforetime ? npm update@angular/cli prolly with -g 
solution: 

issue: I will be grateful if you could take a look on this topic - [<-LINK->] I am going to create chatbot using websockets in Angular2 however I have a problem withERROR TypeError: Cannot read property 'emit' of undefined 
solution: 

issue: best way to have remote content loaded on a ng2 site ? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Why doesn't my code work? It should, right? 
solution: schooltastic:  [<-LINK->]. it is not internal pipe. If it is your custom pipe show us the code please. 

issue:  [<-LINK->]  [<-CODE->] works fine here 
solution: I need to look into the HttpClient.. natecowen: ... but the case has the same logic inHttporHttpClient, there is no difference.. 

issue: Any ideas on how can I debug buggy routes? 
solution: All it does is seem to say that it think /search should be /search and nothing about why it picked to run MainPageComponent. It's also suspicious that MainPageComponent ngOnInit ran before the router events were even happening. 

issue: anyone work with Renderer2?  Im trying to find the angular way of setting the focus to an element on the page when that element is shown 
solution: I had the same question too.  To be safe on universal, just make sure that that codepath can't be reached when calling nativeElement.focus() since no concept of focus on server. 

issue: is it possible to declare multiple interceptors in Angular 4? 
solution: Yeah.. I have already something like: [<-CODE->]. I would like to have another interceptor, like: [InterceptorA, InterceptorB]. You just provide two different interceptors.. 

issue: quick question, which is more correct ? [<-CODE->] 
solution: Personally I prefer it because it doesn't look like generic syntax.. so you would still domyVal : Subject<myType>tho ?. I take it thats what you mean as generic syntax or are you referring to making typescript looking more unique. 

issue: any suggestions how to find a memory leak?  If i leave the website open you can watch it take more and more memory as time goes by 
solution: Right but this is failing on the commit messageExamining 60 commits between HEAD and masterINVALID COMMIT MSG: "docs(*) fix dangling links in API docs (#16632)" => ERROR: The commit message does not match the format of "<type>(<scope>): <subject> OR revert: type(<scope>): <subject>". 

issue: Maybe 3 subscriptions to the returned observables? 
solution: 

issue: can some one provide me resources for angular services and its promises 
solution: 

issue: How can I easily prevent submits on enter in forms? 
solution: It's still a form, I don't want to allow submission while invalid.. The same way that I disable the button, how do I actually disabled the submit event in the form?. 

issue: magic :D 
solution: 

issue: How on earth do you use the newHttpParams?? This isn't doing anything: [<-CODE->] tried with append as well but it doesn't get added 
solution: params = new HttpParams().set('limit', '20');. so I have to do new HttpParams every time I need to append a value?. 

issue: what does your app module look like? 
solution: export let UserSvcServiceProvider = {\n  provide: UserSvcService,\n  useFactory: UserServiceFactory,\n  deps: [Http, forwardRef(() => Router)]\n}. 

issue: Hi, is it good practice to submit a form via get? More specifically for a list filter ... 
solution: 

issue: can we have multiple modules in one application? 
solution: So, i think we need to bootstrap it in appmodule right?. 

issue: Any pointers about creating a custom validator for a case when based on radio-button value, some fields are required and some are not? 
solution: 

issue: alxhub: Hi, why doesHttpParamsis an immutable class ? I get why immutable in general but since Angular doesn't particularly enforce it anywhere why here for http params ? 
solution: All parts of anHttpRequestare immutable because interceptors need to be idempotent.. If a request passes through interceptors, fails, and needs to be retried, the interceptors need to be re-run against the original request, which is only possible if the interceptors haven't changed it the first time through.. 

issue: jrmcdona: nope unless you have JS disabled Universla is generall jsut for the first render 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys, is there an angular2 & electron starter kit for developers? 
solution: 

issue: guys how can i validate img type before upload? guys please suggest, how can i validate img type before upload? 
solution: aadii104: You might be able to load the image into a hidden img element then get the base64 from that and check it somehow. seems like a lot of overkill though. 

issue: How it possible to reload the page in angular 2 only once time ??? 
solution: 

issue: How would you use a pipe in typescript? 
solution: Or inject. Or don't use a pipe to do data transforms. he would just use 2 pipes and store the result. 

issue: Can anyone help me with my question, please? 
solution: elishnevsky: that depends, ask away and maybe someone can.. 

issue: How do you go about reusing your components across different projects but completely disregard styles? 
solution: Is that the recommended way? Crossed my mind couple of times, but when I see "extend" my mind just says "nonono" :). Will that beexactlythe same as if styles were given to the original component? No additional configuration?. 

issue: Is anyone looking for contract work? 
solution: So you're not ever going to see route information there - you have to inject it in the component that the router creates in the<router-outlet>.. 

issue: what the deuce.. how do you have that much free time?  can i have some? 
solution: AaronHood: six week vacation, man. huh. 

issue: what about ng [<-LINK->] ? :P 
solution: 

issue: Why doesn't .changes run on initializing@ContentChildren? 
solution: lazarljubenovic: that didn't work either. 

issue: :D 
solution: 

issue: any recommened m.e.a.n with angular4? 
solution: the A in MEAN does stand for angular.... I think he is looking for something where he can hack three lines into his shell and has got a full working environment with the parts he wants. 

issue: all your components will listen to the same multicasted observable right ? 
solution: i was meaning to have a method getEventsList() :  void which makes a http.get call, and subscribes to it then sets this.eventsList which is public and that components could databind against this.. 

issue: Is there any official documentation about SEO optimization for Angular? 
solution: 

issue: Our application can be run through a proxy that prefixes all urls with their own context path. Is there any way to change the APP_BASE_HREF at runtime to use the dynamic proxy path? 
solution: @alxhub following up from yesterdays discussion on IE scroll handling.This fix did the trick: [<-CODE->] I tried intersection observer, but that polyfill crashed my apps somehow..  it worked great in native chrome though :). 

issue: Second one looks right to me What's the error 
solution: Likely that's being treated as((cars | async)?.name)[modelValue]so you're still looking upmodelValueon anundefinedvalue.. I would write a function that does the.name[modelValue]part and callvalueFn(cars | async)from my view.. alxhub: so have you got any awesome designs I have thought of for a service which would allow unused methods to bee shakes? Re: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: without let,@vapits? 
solution: 

issue: Is it right that@angular/cli 1.2.6will output angular4.0.0when i dong new?  (being that angular 4.3.x is out) 
solution: 

issue: buggers suuup 
solution: well, why not? discussions for 2 still allowed. 

issue: Anyone work with static prerendering with platform-server? 
solution: 

issue: Week of ToH + about 4 days of actual work on the website, results so far: [<-LINK->] It's going well, pretty quick progress with Angular and first-time web dev! 
solution: 

issue: I still don't understand why you'd use an asset folder to put none-assets and try to script them out during build. Sounds like such a waste of effort :D 
solution: rohitsodhia: I doubt any way is going to be considered a good idea if you keep it inside the assets. This has nothing to do with lazyness. You've been looking for a solution longer then it should take if you move them out. :D. rohitsodhia: Anyway: If you are realy lazy, you move the psd's away, create a script so that you never have to move files to your assets folder manually. And everything works as you want, and you can be lazy. (and you're not abusing the assets folder or overcomplicating the build for no reason). 

issue: sharp? 
solution: ndcunningham: It's proposed syntax for private fields in JS classes. 

issue: does it work in dev mode?non aot@dancancro 
solution: ndcunningham: I have lazy routes defined in a couple places. [<-LINK->] 's one. load from basicallysrcso{path: 'legal', loadChildren:'app/features/legal/legal.module#LegalModule'}. 

issue: I have a question. Members that are used in HTML have to be declared public? 
solution: pantonis: yup. you mean in a component html and ts are two different classes?. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] const image then you are assigning to it? maybe that? 
solution: 

issue: lazarljubenovic: one last shot after this im done. I read more into attribute directives for you.   In the docs it says "@Directiverequires aCSS selectorto identify the HTML in the template that is associated with the directive. " If you want a way not to have the attribute everywhere put your selector value as another css selector. [<-LINK->] done 
solution: 

issue: Eeerm why are anchor links not working with Angular anymore :( 
solution: angular no longer supports anchors.  you have to use *ngHref. 

issue: you can pass an injector (child or otherwise) into the createComponent call, btw 
solution: That angular Hq looks a lot like an issue tracker, am I right?. 

issue: How can I make an image available atlocalhost:4200/image.png? 
solution: vadi2: you don't want to have it inside/assets? If not, you need to add it to.angular-cli.jsoninside theassetsarray to be copied over. With CLI, and yes I need it at root. I've put it in/assetsand triedlocalhost:4200/help16.pngbut all I got wasError: Cannot match any routes. URL Segment: 'help16.png':(. 

issue: Morning all! 
solution: It's always been okay to use attribute selectors in certain circumstances. When a component needs to use a particular base tag.. 

issue: hi, im asking for a http call but  instead it's making a https, i've put the url in clear but same behavior, 
solution: No reason any of the internet should use http anymore. 

issue: can we have the url ? 
solution: 

issue: Can you route to a component with a directive attached to it? 
solution: alxhub: yo so I made some adjustments to that routes script I made and was thinking of doing a PR into@angular/universal with it if you think that's a good idea. 

issue: Okay so any idea why the list is not rendered here? [<-LINK->] 
solution: If you have something that works and can live with it, on to the next feature!. Here's a working demo in case anyone's interested: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: made my first attribute component! ... it doesn't work gotta love that, heh 
solution: because i want to modify an existing element... same idea as angular material does. 

issue: Ohhh? ... what was it? 
solution: And I have a suspicion you're doing something wrong in the instantiation of that thing.. 

issue: Morning all :) 
solution: alxhub: looking at the new HttpClientModule, would it be a reasonable design/architecture to create a ngModule, with interceptors to handle errors so that i can share this across multiple projects?. lets be fair@hungerregnuh, webdev, namely JS, advances so far you'll likely shoot yourself in the foot no matter what you do :p. 

issue: the token file should be inside the component I guess? 
solution: when you want to pass js variable to angular - you should do it by with token.. 

issue: Has anyone here gotten gigantic call stacks on router navigation (Lots of Subscriber.next, FirstSubscriber, FirstOperator.call, etc.)?  I checked on angular.io and they don't have that problem with their router initial navigation 
solution: got it. that makes sense. Have you heard of any performance issues on the router?Basically, we have a header that has some important and critical data that we consider our most important first paint metric.  However, we need the URL to decide which variation. [<-CODE->]. 

issue: Anyone know if you can have child routes of a route that is in an auxiliary router outlet?  [<-CODE->] so something like that 
solution: If you just need the URL, you can inject PlatformLocation and get it through that.. bradringel: I didn't do it exactly like that but I did get lazy load into secondary (auxiliary) outlet: [<-ISSUE->] using theProxyRouteComponentin this issue. alxhub: by the way, Yesterday I wanted to change the class in js but you said I should do it with the "angular way". And after a while of thinking I found an "angular solution" and it works great!. 

issue: is APP_INITIALIZER deprecated? 
solution: no deprecation in official docs [<-LINK->]. and your first thought is "is it deprecated?" not "where\'s my bug?" ?. but it was a typo :-). 

issue: Is there any way to makeng buildhttp2 friendly? 
solution: Currently it bundles everything in a few files, right? In http2 it's better not to bundle things and have everything separate (so if we change one of them, only one of them gets invalid in the browser's cache).. 

issue: How to import a .js file in an angular 4 project and use it in your components properly? 
solution: jemliF: like this: import { EventsListFilters } from '../events-list-params';. 

issue: Is this not possible? [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: If I don\'t know what URL my application will be hosted at until it starts running, what is the list of "things" that should be set at run-time knowing that my API path will always be hosted at the same URL and all relative URLs within the application will be valid? BaseHref, anything else? I\'m almost certain that the proxy\'s custom JavaScript injection is causing the problem, but I want to cover my bases. 
solution: 

issue: What's the pure angular way of doing this? [<-CODE->] 
solution: Toxicable: I want to translatefocusevent (the thing that happens with tab key) toclickevent :shame-on-me:. 

issue: not a good idea at all 
solution: Toxicable: !! Whats uP!. cgatian: Sitting in a lecture for C. 

issue: :D 
solution: 

issue: What is the rxjs function if I want to create an Observable that emits the ratio between 2 values of other observables? 
solution: 

issue: I have a question guys. I have a function inside a script tag witch is inside my index.hmtl. Now I need to trigger this function inside my app.component.ts how can I do this? 
solution: 

issue: I thought this should be correct way of using ternary operators in typescript, is it not?(this.segment.insurance_type != 0) ? this.segment.insurance_type: ''; 
solution: Caroga: you are checking if it is not 0 (number), then return it, otherwise, return empty string. What the problem do you have? caninsurance_typebe numeric or string?. tytskiy: nvm, found it. Found out I declared the wrong type in the interface forinsurance_type, it was supposed to be number but i wrote string. 

issue: The Angular animations are ok, I still prefer to do them purly with css and class name manipulation.. just wish Angular made it easier and gots rid of the ceremony 
solution: Eppiox: one of my clients AOT build has run out of memory for a long time now. There's a long issue on github... no workarounds for sufficiently large projects.. 

issue: ok but contentChildren.toArray() returns the whole component objects as an array, how to get the html from this? 
solution: V5hnu_twitter: i think this is not possible at the moment to query for native elements with css selector, see [<-ISSUE->] You could use some wrapper with template variable, then get it's nativeElement and then itsinnerHTMLdirectly. But then it is just static string of html, nothing more. 

issue: heh, i love that there is a gitter i can come to and get help with angular, and hate that php doesn't have something similar :p (that I can find) 
solution: 

issue: Hello, can you tell me who is responsible for the angular.io website? I was asking myself how the google bot is able to crawl the site.... :-) 
solution: No, it's not a universal site. No content if js is deactivated.. No, the crawlers normally have still big issues with JS. We had a few company pages which got a bad SEO ranking after activating JS stuff.. 

issue: wizardnet972: You here mate? 
solution: I will make a new plunker with my files maybe than its easier to see. varun-cd:  [<-LINK->] It isn't working at this moment but it worked at the plunker of Wizard. 

issue: that's a funky endpoint, is it accurate? 
solution: It is some id. Like guid. I think I know what is the problem. 

issue: Hi, what is the benefit of map-ing a response data before subscribing to a http.get request? 
solution: uh, you need to learn how observables and the http client works. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Can I use the index of an ngFor in a template? 
solution: 

issue: is there a downside to using a different angular version than the one setup by cli? like, the latest? 
solution: Using an older one might not work but newer ones generally do. 

issue: hello, anyone here familiar with angular firebase? 
solution: 

issue: how can I pass a class (rather than an instance) as an injected dependancy into a service?> 
solution: kosz: yeah, but then it becomes a little trickkier to mock it. I can't help but think that there may be a better approach to whatever issue you're trying to solve than this. but if only this is what you need the only way I can think off is to have an Injectable instance which has a function which can return classes. 

issue: whats your preferred method? i could upload it to github if you want 
solution: sweet, i haven't uploaded to github before so that would have taken a while. 

issue: better than a C++ template error 
solution: 

issue: yes, you can@javajohnHub 
solution: well if anyone can sift through that and see an error id appreciate it... my request doesnt fire. 

issue: the ``` has to be on its own line 
solution: 

issue: you can also press the up key over your last comment to open the edit menu 
solution: hungerregnuh: focus has to be outside of the chatbox, on the posted comments above. javajohnHub: if things are firing out of order due to being async, use async/await to force synchronous behavior. 

issue: Hi! I want to remove a class from a div and add a class in another div. I could do that with jQuery, but where do I insert the script with angular? [<-LINK->] navbar.component.html is the template where I want to change classes for a navbar (active) and index.html is my current status but it does not work. 
solution: Carniatto: I didn't copy all code because I thought it is a simple questions.I read that I am not supposed to use jQuery, but I only found ElementReference for angular but even angular.io says you should not use it :DI don't understand how I can use ngClass in this context because I assume I need a selector for my html tags/classes. 

issue: Hi guys, who can help me? 
solution: I've created a simple project here: [<-LINK->]. There's a Refresh button in theHeaderComponent, outside of router-outlet.. 

issue: so I should make it in its own separate component? 
solution: Toxicable: should I have the component in with the other html of the page. Then have anngIf on it to show or not and the service controls if thengIf is true or false? is that what you mean by the service determining the state?. Then control weather it's open or closed with a service, like how Material does. 

issue: Man anyone have any tutorials on how to make node modules in typescript that can be used by vanilla node.js? 
solution: I have a ts class that I've made a node_module everything works 100% code coverage.  I publish it and  it doesn't really import when i bring it into my other project.  I looked at@angularpackages and they seem to have only.d.tsand pure js files... I just have a lot more of these I wanna write and I'm sure I can make my build work but it's just not as elegant. 

issue: where can I find the Angular 5 roadmap? 
solution: achimha: I don't think there is a roadmap, but could ask me. 

issue: Guys is there a way to read and write xml files? 
solution: Well could you enlighten me I have been searching for things but I have really no idee how .... DyanGomes_twitter: it depends on what you wanna do. Convert to JSON/js objects? Or a DOM/SAX interface?. 

issue: hi, all, I want to cache the HTTP POST response by creating my own cache using node_module "angular-cache". all the search results didn\'t, however, explain how to create the object "cache" in my service or component. Please could anybody help? 
solution: alxhub: I am using Angular 2 though. angular-cache is something I found from google search. In any way, what is the best solution to cache a http POST response so that I can retrieve it in a different component. the scenario here is: I have a search result summary component, and a detail component. on detail component page, by clicking a link to go back the search result summary component page..

issue: has anyone created a cascading dropdown using a reactive form? 
solution: Looks like mouseover and mouseenter are broken. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] here's how they make the material module. so just import the modules that you want to use 
solution: so if you wanted to only use MdButtonModule, then create your custom module like this: [<-CODE->]. That helps a lot, ive been importing individual modules to my shared module and found it getting messy quite fast. 

issue: The components inside the switch? 
solution:

solution: Toxicable: I gotta weird question for you.

solution: JeffreyTravers9_twitter: you'll still have empty div from the ngFor. could work withng-containerinstead ofdivatngForlevel. 

issue: throwing this here again in case someone with knowledge about forms can help me out: [<-LINK->] 
solution: instead of implementing value accessor. 

issue: Hi guys, how to solve a 'Promise' hell? I have a ton of sequential promise, is there a cleaner way to do this? 
solution: you don't need to await every line by the way -- just the ones you want to force synchronous behavior. 

issue: why doesgetErrorMessages()returns an observable ?? 
solution: webdev48: it's also a little odd that you have two types of data (name messages and error messages) flowing through the same channel?. 

issue: curious for the folks that have a ton of modulesandhave split them into third party modules is it possible to share state if each module has their own ngrx stores? 
solution: look at your domain model, not your component model, when designing ngrx stores. I found using the store was a pain in larger apps. 

issue: question: ifHttpmodule is deprecated and replaced(^4.3.x) withHttpClientmodule.. what happens toURLSearchParamsclass? 
solution: harshes53: @angular/common/http dosent define a UR/SrearchParams class. 

issue: Does it use generators? 
solution: 

issue: developer tooling for the mac is amazingly good. 
solution: I profoundly dislike the ui, but other than startup I never see it. I hate the window managementbut since my multi tasking on the mac is low it dosen't bother me much. 

issue: what module provides ComponentFactoryResolver? I'm not getting an injection error but when a class method is called it is undefined. 
solution: beasue it’s a service I think. 

issue: What? Almost all the Angular team uses Macs :P 
solution: I use Windows Desktop at home, but mainly becasue you cant play any games on mac or Ubuntu/any other linux distro. i would take a free mac because free anything is better, but i would never waste my own money on them.. 

issue: what does flushMicrotasks(); do? 
solution: 

issue: ^ how so? 
solution: 

issue: josephliccini: no, delay Zone loading until after those widgets maybe? 
solution: I am not sure it's the widgets actually.. I haven't been able to repro yet.  But I can't think of anything else that would patch Promise. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] Any thoughts? =) 
solution: I suspect the httploader is not loading. sharikovvladislav: check the network panel, see if the translations are loaded.

solution: Dinodanio: no. I want to set a reachable url without the /assets..... 

issue: So after reading this: [<-LINK->] I see how to do stuff with requests, but don't quite see how to intercept responses. Any ideas? 
solution: Looks like it, I stopped using bootstrap once I found material. If I want to intercept and manipulate the response body, do I need to clone the request already? This is a bit confusing. 

issue: Any idea on how to provider a service to two different lazy loaded modules in the best way? It is funny in some places (stackeroverflow) guys are saying that having services in a shared module is bad practice and others say it is the right way :D 
solution: 

issue: why is it you can call 'localStorage' in angular without importing a dependacy? 
solution: 

issue: Somebody there?

issue: hi ) i have FormData object and want to sent it with HttpClient post method, how can this be achieved? It does not work If i pass it directly asbodyparam 
solution: I try to send FormData (without files) with HttpClient and haveContent-Type: multipart/form-datawhen expected isapplication/x-www-form-urlencoded.

solution: 

issue: what is thatJsonpclass? 
solution: harshes53:  [<-LINK->]. HttpClientJsonpModuleimport this module and do the necessary. 

issue: is this code correct: [<-CODE->] 
solution: if username is undefined, it will use placeholderText?. 

issue: Anyone have a reactive forms with material select/option component working? I don't get how anyones got reactive forms with material working, the docs are so bad :| 
solution: I think that concludes my time with reactive forms.  When things go wrong the errors don't make sense.   It's like the people who made material took inspiration in poor error reporting with the same people who made the angular forms x_x. 

issue: Hi all. Is this the main Angular 2+ community? is there a Slack channel? 
solution: There are various slack communities but I think this is the biggest public Angular channel. 

issue: what's the easiest way to prefix a email address in an interpolation with mailto: ?

issue: burhanmeydan: what is your cli version? 
solution: Dinodanio:. 

issue: I've been summoned ? 
solution: ghetolay: when I get a chance though I'll make a PR on the SDK for it though. ghetolay: on the angular repo, but I think it's better suited for the CDK rather than core. 

issue: Hello guys. I can't find the answer  about http, rxjs. [<-LINK->] 
solution: This.http.get().mergeMap( firstResult => this.http.get()). Toxicable: This way doesn't suit for me. I did even notice about this in question (How can I make series of requests without merging, forking etc.?) And I want to understand why this is. 

issue: I wish the team would release AOT watch mode already tomorrow? 
solution: well.... but if you're feeling brave it'll be on Rc.0. nicec. I mean you could pull Angular down from master and compiler it locally. 

issue: How can I communicate with a component from an interceptor? 
solution: I want a component that tracks http progress and an interceptor is the natural way to hook into it.. 

issue: how can i retrieve this value on photoUrl  [<-LINK->] 
solution: well if you mean provide default methods in the sense like default implementations. 

issue: with the ngmodule factory map thing, is it supposed to split the bundles for platform server? 
solution: 

issue: Hello is there way to change button md-mini-fab  Ripple color ? 
solution: because at the very least you can override style sheets  and that should allow you to do mostly anything. angular animations I have triggering when I need them to execute, but the enter and exit is getting funky.  I'm starting with a style of translateX(0) and opacity 0, and trying to animate to translateX(100%) and opacity 1. 

issue: a server factory build? for Universal? 
solution: yeah somodule-map-ngfactory-loaderis like you said a sync module loader. 

issue: how would i go about pre-rendering each route?  [<-LINK->] this the tool? 
solution: you need that for lazy loaded modules, but my tool relies on it aswell.  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: How can test google crawler for internal links. I only found rendering test. 
solution: i cant stand this in every form with a mobile number. 

issue: geez! the json thing is still going on? 
solution: adityaparab: is"933dd683-3541-4f35-bc50-005a35f9c14c"the whole answer, because before you posted something with"content": .... 

issue: how iswishListProductsinitialized and set? 
solution: I run into that a lot, but only when I'm being too lose with my variables. If you're expecting something to be an array, initialize it as a blank array. In my experience, there's rarely a reason for it to not at least be an empty array.. At most, you could have it set to null, but off the top, I can't think of any situation where a null gives significant advantages over a blank array.. 

issue: where you from? australia? 
solution: NZ. close enough :). Apeteceume_twitter: watch it. 

issue: <div *ngIf="wishListProducts?.length == 0" does that work? 
solution: but if it works sometimes and not others it sounds like the call you're subscribing to sometimes doesn't return an array. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] why this does not work? what is the syntax to use Transition in AnimationBuilder ?? 
solution: You should definitely get some sleep@notsonotso:D. no. 

issue: Hello, guys! I've spent several days and have not found any answers for this question: [<-LINK->] Can anyone give me any idea 
solution: ghetolay: I've tried, but in repro all is going well. Then I've commented 99% my project and run just app component with the loop who creates obs and subscribes like this:for (let i = 1; i < 50; i++) {\n            http.get(`https://swapi.co/api/people/${i}`).subscribe();\n        }and this cancels 50% requests. 

issue: why 1 + + "1" === 2;  in javascript 
solution: sajeetharan: associativity and type conversion. sajeetharan: Think of it1 + (+"1"). too slow. too much sock smoking.. notsonotso: I have better formatting... 

issue: better than johnny dep it's aaron long time, no speak 
solution: been SWAMPED with a tight deadline. 

issue: meow 
solution: adityaparab: waaaasssup. How's Luke Vader?. yup. 

issue: i s ViewChild and ViewChildren the correct way to convert this jquery to Angular?  [<-CODE->] 
solution: but I need to grab some click events for regular HTML that is external to my app but on my site. bit of a hack I have to do, since passing HTML with links through SafeHTML doesn't accomplish what I need since SafeHtml doesn't do binding or anything other than sanitization. 

issue: hey I was there a few months ago 
solution: Toxicable: get back to work. I mean I don't have a job... sooooo. unless you live in NZ probably not. Then I didn't !. 

issue: also if you do want to do that don't pull in the css in an external style sheet just make it inline 
solution: been busy all weekend at a hackfest type thingy. 

issue: what'sCoreModulein this case, and how are you using the forRoot? why should that matter? 
solution: single threaded race condition. when request is effectively completed abort does nothing. but in some case it cancel the request, meaning it was probably not totally completed. 

issue: hello what type of form  is best to use for Sig in / Log in Forms ? template, reactive or dynamic ? 
solution: Toxicable: and what i should use for simple  'Email' 'password' input FormGroup and FormControl. or FormBuilder and FormGroup. 

issue: on a toaster? 
solution: yeah and it works without a hitch, but didn't give that much of a boost really :P. 

issue: What's the event in angular to see if user has zoomed in/out in browser?! 
solution: 

issue: id like to use flex css, but it's ie buggy :/ 
solution: I've only encountered one snag with flex in firefox and only in very specific conditions.. 

issue: Hello everyone,do you know if there is a way to translate the attributes of an interface from english to german/ german to german(I mean if there is already an attribute,which name is in german)? I have managed to translate some of them, but the others are attributes are already in german or shortcuts. But I need them to be named this way,because I have a database table and I want to keep the name of the interface's attributes same as the table's columns. Hope this makes sense. 
solution: 

issue: is there way to clear ReactiveForm on submit ? 
solution: Toxicable: and could you point my in some direction because i'm lost. yes it works but it clear but it will also show the Errors. 

issue: can i run a resolver on children changes? 
solution: no idea, create a plunker. also i dont see what's the benefit of this being a pipe. 

issue: a future TS will apparently have [P in keyof T where T[P] extends number]: T[P]; conditonals in mapped types... sweet 
solution: notsonotso: Is there something like ngFor for object properties?. yes@robertbrower-technologies, but we can't remove them ;). 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] How I can fix this? 
solution: you need to pick a prop first. 

issue: is there a way to user ng-content without having it in the DOM? 
solution: 

issue: since http calls automatically unsubscribe, would it be safe to do nested http subscribes? 
solution: yeah I'm having a discussion with some developers ob whether nested subscribes cause a memory leak. They're not necessarily going to cause memory leaks - though you're still responsible for unsubscribing properly (even with http calls).. 

issue: Toxicable: can you point me to a good example of a cli json file? I'm ready to give it a shot. 
solution: That said, there are open bugs of this issue against cli so it may also be affected. Tbh, angular build bugs are basically impossible to pin down.. 

issue: String, mutable property? 
solution: CD works from top to bottom so if I change a sibling property from my component -- how would CD pick that up?. 

issue: I have an application, on the internet. Except that I did not want to store information in my client's browser. Can I do this? 
solution: get rid of zones for what?. 

issue: how would the proxying look like? 
solution: I think the parent component should be handling that value. if a component changes a property of its parent -- would that trigger CD?. 

issue: Does anyone know when the new compiler is supposed to be coming out? 
solution: currently using ngc and rollup. sam-s4s: tried the cli before?. 

issue: Is there a way to list routes of lazy loaded modules at runtime ? 
solution: 

issue: Yes, you can just inject the directive. 
solution: alxhub: I made that issue about the state transfer api's to get some more opinions [<-ISSUE->] just so people can see a side by side comparisonHowever I personally am still in favour of yours, which I write a kinda bad draft implimentation of. 

issue: is it a directive or pipe 
solution: you are using it like a pipe in template i see. no that is decimal pipe of angular. 

issue: Someone know if is possible add one token header in angular2+ templateUrl request? 
solution: 

issue: how are you injecting an object without a token? yeah that's not how it works use a token 
solution: 

issue: In typescript and Angular should methods decorated with@HostListnersbe public or private? 
solution: ghetolay: If i try to bind directly to the string i get an error ERROR Error: unsafe value used in a resource URL context. babeal: you could use a pipe to make it safe. 

issue: someone can help me please ? : [<-LINK->] 
solution: ghetolay: I can use this.map all on my class except in google.visualization.events.addListener(){} why ?. 

issue: can  someone confirm if HostBinding("style.xxxx") is 2 way?  or set only? 
solution: YOu say that like "binding" explicitly means 1 way.. (which it doesnt) - I am happy that the answer to my question is 1 way - but I dont think it\'s implied by the term "binding". 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: pew pew pew 
solution: so it always outputsmain.bundle.js. Doesn't need hashing cause it won't get cached by something like a CDN/Reverse proxy. 

issue: btw the project is for an Australian client 
solution: orly. you might be neighbors. lazarljubenovic: it's so easy to do prerendering at least though. yeah but the schedule is tight and ive never done that. 

issue: Morning guys,  anyone knows if there is an equivalent to the ng1 StrictContextualEscaping in agular 2/4 ? 
solution: Apparently is a service that you inject for security [<-LINK->]. Right angular has that built in. By default it'll escape all interpolated strings. TudorIoanMarin:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Is There  a way to filter the data through a pipe? or which is the best way 
solution: Toxicable: so what is the best way to filter data? or Do I need to create new components that set the data  through a button?. Toxicable: yep I know what you mean but if I have some links that are premade to filter the data... like buttons. 

issue: isn't is the same here as ViewChild? 
solution: or next tick aftertickerCountchanges. :) I thought there's more angular way. I think even with ViewChildren you may need a setTimeout. 

issue: Can we get dynamic meta tags, titles in view source in Angular 4 project..? 
solution: 

issue: do you have any good links comparing the two? 
solution: Elfayer: it all depends on scope. The best way imo is to make a quick project in each.. Eppiox: I would like pros and cons. Is it just a style blur? You could leave it to css which is meant to be optimized in its own thread vs done by JS. 

issue: xD 
solution: ericmartinezr: always at the right moment.  [<-LINK->]. cant make it work in a custom directive :(. 

issue: hello, how can I retrieve class from a template view without pass by javascript (getElementByClass) ? 
solution: lazarljubenovic: @ghetolayIn fact I use a tree component that generates div tags. I would like to manipulate the div inside except that I do not have access in my view. 

issue: Anyway... Any way to get urlQueryParams in a service? 
solution: lazarljubenovic: I tried, but neither contain the necessary information inside the service. 

issue: does the(change)event work forcheckedproperty? on an input that is. 
solution: it doesn't seem like it does when you dynamically set the value ofchecked, i.e. when you don't physically click. chrillewoodz: I don't think events are fired when you change value programmatically. 

issue: Q.my actual url isa/{id}/b/cfrom this how can I change only{id}with keeping/b/c?!? 
solution: 

issue: Then do you have the app comonent declared in your root module along with it being a bootsrap component?

solution: 

issue: think 5.0 will be out on the 18th?  I don't think they are at RC yet 
solution: 

issue: only class names or selectors too ? but what stops you from testing it yourself ? 
solution: 

issue: steveblue: so it's actually fast enough? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Awkward. What does it mean? 
solution: that means thatngx-bootstrapisn't packaged properly. but.. I have a solution for that! its really not great ill be honest.... But firstly check their repo, open an issue if there isn't one already. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] can anyone help me out? 
solution: mmanavaz: , this.addCode .emit(this.addSelectedCode);. I can't believe it was that simple... 

issue: how can I remove paranthese and space with JS for this number: +40 (756) 939 586 ? 
solution: benydc: , quickest and easiest is phone.replace.... 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] because i'm returning an empty console isn't being reached? 
solution: it's paired down code... because in my function i do a lot of conditioning and call other observable.. that's the return result if it falls through all conditions. 

issue: yeah way too many packages sit at 0.x 
solution: 

issue: how do I stagger animate each element in row form?

issue: o/ 
solution: 

issue: hi all, I have an input like this [<-CODE->] and I would like to modify the min attribute with the next day of todayhow should I do that (modify html element attribute dynamically)? 
solution: ehouarn-perret: it is about modifying dom elements using typescript/angular, not about material2, same thing can be asked with a normal input withour material 2. 

issue: Route guards are not meant to be a security feature, right? 
solution: Z3roCoder: It's called a guard for a reason. chrillewoodz: Yes, but it is still a client-side thing, and it would not suffice to just use a route guard to prevent my user from accessing /admin. Z3roCoder: As with all other things, you should have both client and server side security checks. So don't just depend on a guard to keep your routes safe like you said. 

issue: didn't Tox make an awesome virtual scroller? 
solution: Toxicable: i can see how it's broken. Salmon pink!. 

issue: what about intents ? When will that be available 
solution: and Randall Munroe on occasion.  [<-LINK->]. once you get a fair number of datapoints on a chart. 

issue: does angular automatically generated a template variable for all inputs in a ngform? 
solution: it uses a ControlValueAccessor via FormControl or FormControlName. If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated FormControl (like validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using ngModel as the key (ex: #myVar="ngModel"). You can then access the control using the directive\'s control property, but most properties you\'ll need (like valid and dirty) will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a full list of properties directly available in AbstractControlDirective.. 

issue: developers use base64 encoding for password hashing 
solution: or access to it. surely you have heard of breaches. happens all the time.. 

issue: Yawn, wassup A week in the shaming room

solution: Jefftopia: I know, check the imports of CoreModule. Those are probably wrong and you are importing another CoreModule. 

issue: I am 
solution: 

issue: how do you create a object variable in typescript? 
solution: since you're setting it directly yu shouldn't need to use sanitizer. only when you're binding/interpolating that Angular runs the sanitizer. well it aint showing. 

issue: so i just wrap the native service in a service ? 
solution: ill be looking int writing a Universal localStorage imp soon after StateTransfer lands, but if that goes through it'll live under@nguniversal. There's a bunch of other things that we can build ontop of StateTransfer to make things easy, but the issue is making them consistent across the board. the way I see it is that you should hardly ever have to useisPplatformBrowser/Server, instead use API's which handle it for oyu. 

issue: hey all express4 is not working with nodemon any solution? 
solution: yes.  [<-LINK->]. notsonotso: koa <3.

issue: well I submitted a feature req anyway [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: cedvdb: you cannot apply an arbitrary directive on a class. 

issue: ban him, then delete the issue 
solution: idk, I don't think there's anything else I can say that's not just feeding him. 

issue: you can't do aot without ts ?? 
solution: and you know how we keep going on about static analysis that and static analysis that. because if really we can't aot with just js and since it's kinda going to be the only mode. 

issue: npm -g list typescript 
solution: 

issue: have you tried just setting ts to 2.3.4 after deleting node_modules and reinstalling? 
solution: so i just updated node from 6 to 8. seems to work well. any reason why i shouldn't have done this? regarding universal or otherwise. EreckGordon: 6.11 is the latest stable release, but if you want experimental features go with 8. 

issue: is there a way to only load specific vendor/package js per component? 
solution: bad example, but if someone wanted to use jquery just on that one module.

issue: how do you make a synchronous/$ajax call in angular 2+? 
solution: if something is running in sync it will hodl the mean thread. meaning that no one will be able to do anything at all while it's doing a http request. 

issue: my-navbar* 
solution: Toxicable: ^. I think so. I personally never have the need though. since async pipe will trigger change detection. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] css spec high af 
solution: I assumed it did new ArSocketService in the background. 

issue: I'm not using material but shouldn't you add mdInput to the native input ? 
solution:

solution: When you try to fetch something over the network, for example when you fetch data from an API it can take some time and it's an asynchronous mechanism..

solution: gho5thunter: is that weird? I want to access attributes from the component instance of a child route.

solution: There is no directive with "exportAs" set to "rowData". hardikpatel-1: that's not date pipe problem. he said he removed it. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Kaput? 
solution: you didn't replace the one in the root directory. so where view will be kept thats the issue i think so. 

issue: I think that I have the same problem. I want to get different navs in different parts of application (modules) but I want to keep consistent layout 
solution: it makes sense bc the router is build trunk to leaves, but it\'s annoying that I can\'t supply a "default" layout.. 

issue: Ok, wrote. Why is it better? I lost all my types information from service methods [<-CODE->] 
solution: You need to use destrcturing to maintisn your types. I mean you shouldn't need this part: [Company, Detail[]]TS should be able to infer it. 

issue: the above code is for me Fabian? 
solution: Toxicable: Well, there's no reason for both FormArray and FormGroup to exist, the correct abstraction is a linked hash tree that preserved the insertion order. At which point you have FormMap to replaced them both. Nowthatis the PR :D. notsonotso: while true, there's an implication there. 

issue: basehref is just something you set in your index html page 
solution: dude. 

issue: any solution? 
solution: you're so nice. phew. 

issue: Toxicable: I got this. smooth up and down now 
solution: 

issue: guys. Relative link 
solution: DavidTheProgrammer: I am at this route when this function gets called: [<-LINK->]. It results in a route change to this route: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Have you guys seen edit.ng? :o 
solution: Seems like the angular team is working on some sort of plnkr compatible with AOT :D. RicardoVaranda: yeah they've had a intern working on it for the last few months. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] why notsubmitevent of a form? 
solution: it doesnt matter, you can submit the form by pressing enter. lazarljubenovic: is it!!! but still this way also I can reach my method & do something... so I dint try other approach.. Thanks...will try that also.. But for now I am stuck at navigating external liknks. 

issue: VaaniSai: Can anyone please answer this too :( 
solution: or const headerMap = new HttpHeaders({'Content-Type': 'application/json'}). 

issue: also  if on beta5, need ts 2.4 5beta* 
solution: yup, at 26 you're in elderly care. because someone 12 year old kid created a framework which beats all perf benchmarks of react. 

issue: how else do you do a dick waving contest? 
solution: sounds like more work than just whipping it out and saying look at me. 

issue: im a strong independent integer who dont need no one to tell me what i can and cannot focus 
solution: EreckGordon: You are funny!. 

issue: help me folks Error is LoginComponent is not ngModule  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: hi everyone. I am facing scenario in which in have to update,edit and delete query Paramaters  with out change state of router. Is it possible   and if yes than how to do it? 
solution: 

issue: someone has got a nice recommendation for a rich text editor in angular? 
solution: short descr. is errors are caught in the services, services translate their own errors so they are self contained, particular errors like unauthorized or token expired, etc. navigate you to the login route, errors are shown in a toast. coderishu: I would try to complete the tutorial. It only takes a couple hours. then you won't be sitting with basic problems for days.. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] welcome to the future 
solution: a set of optional packages to bring IDE-like functionality to Atom.O. 

issue: Make sure@angular/cdk is in your node modules and your dependencies 
solution: 

issue: Guys , I need to use a windows software in my angular2 App.How can I approach it ? 
solution: I need to achieve that functionality in angularApp.The UI can be done normally but the main part is to connect this angular App to that windows software. so can you run that converter on your server, and just have it send the xml file to angular's frontend through an angular http request?\\. 

issue: what's going on with github... 
solution: 

issue: Is there an option to load scripts in the head of index.html? 
solution: alxhub: That\'s a shame - I need a script tag in the head for a third-party vendor, and I need to load set some env-specific properties before that script is loaded. What\'s the "angular-cli" way of accomplishing this?. 

issue: i dont think i can write a valid hello world html 
solution: 

issue: run the build from the root? 
solution: foxjazz: uh, thatisthe project root. 

issue: did you find out what pure was ? 
solution: Some of these optimizations add /*@__PURE__*/ comments. These are used by UglifyJS to identify pure functions that can potentially be dropped.. that set of explanations was one more reason why i said yeah i don't want to mess with webpack config, cli save me. 

issue: is it pretty safe to run build optimizer 
solution: I run rollup already and from time to time, it rolls shit out of the distribution bundles of my lib. I really really really wish there wa sa recipe for library dev publishing. but like a cli project type for that. 

issue: decorators aren't the answer here  [<-LINK->] this is the kinda code you need to mess with class instances with decorators it's not pretty, or straight forward and probaly wont work with AOT 
solution: 

issue: what exactly new in that transitions that didn't exist in v4+  ? 
solution: now rewriting that with angular animations as no reason have tons of custom css styles as it all already baked in to angular animations. 

issue: Anyone can tell me how to handle global styles, ie fonts, variables, grid etc? Right now I'm including it in every component, but that seems quite the hassle 
solution: maxime1992: Well let's say I want to use a mixin or a variable in one of my components. Then the variables will be undefined unless I explicitly import them.. @lwensveen take a look here: https://github.com/maxime1992/angular-ngrx-starterI've tried to setup few things to quickly start an app with ngrx but there's a whole part about scss (CF readme + source code). It might give you some ideas. 

issue: your PR soved all problems, now all tests will always be running? 
solution: it sounds like a cat. 

issue: is there a take&upload screenshot shortcut in Gitter? 
solution: I don't use . I'll try it.. yvonne6344: you need it when you want to do that... see beginner guide: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: How to change Angular Cli bundle path? 
solution: ronnyek: just like date/time pickers, all angular tree components suck. 

issue: Hey guys! Can I somehow get access to the modul a component/service is used by? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: sinedsem:  [<-LINK->]. robertmain: yes, I need to know how to use external libs with angular. 

issue: from 1.x to 2.x? :P also what is "not working"? 
solution: 

issue: in whatever situations we should create a new component ? 
solution: else for standard practises i would suggest components as it helps in modularising. i may be wrong not a angular expert , wish@Toxicablewas here. 

issue: Morning 
solution: You should define a components responsibility before writing it, therefore you know when you start writing outside of what that component should be doing to make a new component. sajeetharan: I find that if I'm fighting or bending angular to get it to do something routine, back up and see if a component or different strategy would be easier.. 

issue: do we have anything in@angular/formsfor group of checkboxes? 
solution: yeah I think reactive forms has a value accessor for it. like a binding through array of values. i swear i used it somewhere but i dont know which framework was it. 

issue: good morning all, anyone knows a workaround this issue? [<-LINK->] 
solution: notsonotso: Right now all it does is render enough items to fill the viewportand plays around with how to do bottom/top spaces. amusingly, this is all fairly simple to do with plain js/css. Angular surely muddies the waters at times.. 

issue: How, my parent component calls a method that pushes to the array every time its clicked? 
solution: No, you're right I just got it, it works fine when my interpolation references this.cartItem.cart.length directly but not when I assign that to a new value which makes perfect sense with what you said.. 

issue: resolve the promise 
solution:  [<-LINK->] the async pipe will resolve the promise. but don't put a function like that in your template.. 

issue: are you doing this virtual scroll for science? 
solution: I’ve been using this [<-LINK->] works kinda fine, and there’s also an issue in material repo with some alternatives, lemme find it. 

issue: I want to resolve my configuration in a route. How do I get the resolved object? 
solution: But how do I get at what is resolved from the component that uses it?. 

issue: angular = react 
solution: i dont like it. 

issue: Hey guys, how are you making your SPA SEO-friendly? 
solution: So do I just add tag everytime I go into this component? Or do I use update tags accordingly?. 

issue: I'm beginner . I have a example . Can you help me? 
solution: but I think they didn't find a proper use case to do it. 

issue: deciding to update angular, material and ngrx after months of not having time to do so turned out to be as amazingly stupid idea as I extected it to be 
solution: I don’t know, @Toxicable, everthing. I managed to get rid of almost all errors, now I’m just getting buttload ofzone.js:2758 Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceededthat seem to somehow be related to raven.js (https://github.com/getsentry/raven-js). 

issue: how can I even get the current ActivatedRoute inside a router? :/ I think if I inject ActivatedRoute it's only the activatedRoute at the time of injection and isn't updated or is it?this.activatedRoute.url.valueis always"" 
solution: 

issue: looks like I cant even get ngClass to work properly... oh well, onto the less efficient method 
solution: instead gotExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError: Expression has changed after it was checked. Previous value: ''. Current value: 'fullWidth,underHeader'. 

issue: what specific error ar eyou getting? 
solution: when component is destroyed and I recreate it, for some reason all user checkboxes are selected :-|. to be fair, not all questions are easily googleable, and if you don't know the answer, it's not clear which ones are and which arne't. 

issue: what store? 
solution: 

issue: Hi there, does anyone know if Angular has a default timeout on XHR requests? 
solution: richdotjs_twitter: it does not.. It goes alright :). I see that PR to move service worker in :D. 

issue: But if app.component is your bootstrap component, how can you route to it? 
solution: 

issue: if I have a custom component in a form can I know inside the component if it's in invalid state???? 
solution: mlc-mlapis: yes reactive. vigohe: ... takeInjectorthrough DIconstructor(private _injector: Injector)and then you can geterrorsproperty as ... [<-CODE->]. 

issue: does anyone know of a utility which will transform[1,2,3,4,7,8,9]to[[1, 4], [7, 9]]? 
solution: I have some unexpected behavior.. the resolver never gets calls. Can a resolver be placed on the root component?. it is not calling it.. 

issue: Helloo whats wrong with this any suggestion please [<-CODE->] its saying switchmap not available 
solution: ghetolay: yes i can but was quite surprise in another project of minethis was working [<-CODE->]. 

issue: did you add your service to providers array in app module@coderishu 
solution: yes. rahulrsingh09:.  [<-LINK->]. you forgot to add the httpModule to the imports@coderishu. 

issue: So playground API's likehttps://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/have cors set so anyone can access their api, like what you are suggesting me to do? 
solution: By default you can only access the API from the same host/port, but I can manually change it to give access to my Angular app's port, or*ports. igoramidzic: yep.. hence "Cross Origin", CORS will block the request if the client request is originating from a different host than the server.  Maybe in production u will be serving the client from the same host as the server and u wont need to worry about it. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] but it fails...? how do people even find out what to import for rxjs? 
solution: 

issue: "Expression has changed after it was checked" can really lead some crazy wild goose chasing 
solution: I am assuming it is "a" property of my component that is being used as an@Inputto a child component that appears in my component\'s template.. 

issue: hey there. Is anybody doing stateless form components (FormGroup used)? or they only can be stateful? 
solution: rohitsodhia: looks as I need to patch FormGroup values on ngOnChanges and that may lead to editing issues like lost carriage position, maybe some else ... also that means I will need to emit new copy of@Inputparam %) sounds weird, that's why asking. 

issue: VaaniSai: there are some tools that implement the [<-LINK->] , like [<-LINK->] not sure if angular-cli will have this 
solution: Yeah.. I am using angular-cli.... But any time you want to create a library you need something like that. 

issue: n 
solution: 

issue: why i am getting warning message? [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: It looks like you're using the disabled attribute. 

issue: I would be grateful if you could take a look on this [<-LINK->] Any ideas how can I solve it? 
solution: 

issue: how to upload files on plunker? 
solution: then you didn't copy it correctly. 

issue: Can I create an observable for a collection of observables, kind of like a join? 
solution: Toxicable: I am wanting to use the transformed data as a value in a module, like below. [<-CODE->]. 

issue: I feel like I’ve asked hundred times already, but what would you use to figure out which part of the route tree just activated? 
solution: yes, but can I be 100% sure that the last route in the tree is the one that was just activated?. 

issue: Anyone got tips on designing libs? 
solution: I’m working on a d3 angular library and trying to figure out how to best design an api that is friendly. ghetolay: ... but I still think that they have some repo backups ... one or two days sure .... 

issue: Hi. Does anyone know which library is responsible for setting System.import? 
solution: EreckGordon: I guess this is not the case. I have a project that neither reference SystemJs and even so System.Import works.. 

issue: what style do you want to change ? 
solution: Component A has::host { background: red }you extend it and provide:host { background: blue }then surely NGC knows you've just overriden the background property. 

issue: AngularJS 2.0 will be the greatest framework! 
solution: Btw, a monthly reminder that this exists: [<-LINK->]. I need to use this on my lib, but System.Import dont works. 

issue: Which is better: flex-layout with angular material or ng-bootstrap? 
solution: stupidly-logical: there’s one major thing (for me anyway) missing from flex-layout.. and that is ability to easialy create "gutters". well this works@lazarljubenovic [<-LINK->] but sure, if you have a better way, I’ll gladly check it. 

issue: so any other bindings you want me to check while im here? 
solution: imma sleep now.  [<-LINK->]. got a silly programming assignment that im drawing a blank on. 

issue: Hi@all, My app is going to big with a lot of components 
solution: and i am going to use angular/cli with multiapp setting to break down into multi small module. There's a lot of people in the room and it's meant for admin use. 

issue: synchronous http calls@ASmeha that's not how web works 
solution: lazarljubenovic: I might not understood what you need exactly but, I don't think facebook differentiates the route. In the first case where you click on a picture in your profile,  a modal is opened to display the picture and the url is modified manually to allow you to copy paste easily. There is no redirect or anything.  If you go to this url though, you are essentially in another part of facebook.. 

issue: What is the best way to usewindowandglobal? Should I be using@angular/cdk for that? 
solution: i know this doesnt have a single-line answer, it's a question if someone has a working example or wants to experiment by building a demo :). 

issue: Hi, is there any way to add mask to datepicker? 
solution: I\'m using the MEAN stack and I\'ve encountered a routing problem when I build the angular4 app into the node app\'s public directory.(Routing works perfectly when the angular app is served seperately from the node.js app)When I navigate to localhost:3000, the front-end interface is correctly loaded and the front-end routing works as I nagivate between pages using links/buttons in the pages.But if I try to navigate between pages by typing the url into the browser manually, all urls aside from "localhost:3000/" are intercepted by the back-end and the return is "cannot GET /home" (for example).. 

issue: What's the latest version of typescript that angular is compatible with? 
solution: note thatgetBoundingClientRectcauses a reflow. Toxicable:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Hi there! :) [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: @mlc-mlapis except that in your case I could do: [<-CODE->] @EreckGordon I'd have to put it inside an array... If I go this way (wrapping) I'd rather prefer to put it inside an  object and use ngIf (doesn't seem like if looping over something). yeah, in an array with a length of 1 object. to avoid ngif filtering out falsy values like 0. 

issue: unless i need the last value? 
solution: You're right, I'm probably overthinking the problem. bah, when php and javascript disagree :p. And since Map doesn't seem to be well supported in IE, I guess doing something like an array of keys which can then reference the object. 

issue: How do you convert an observable to a string? Like: [<-CODE->] 
solution: ghetolay: I have a callback which needs a string returned, but I can't get the actual value to return from it instead of the observable. 

issue: I need to use a webpack plugin with my angular-cli project. Is it possible to extend or overwrite the webpack config? :( 
solution: but then cli functionality won't work on ejected project.. 

issue: no? 
solution: 

issue: any one can tell how i have removed the form array in reactive form how to add it again in controls of reactive forms 
solution: irfanmayo0786: if you want to use multiple values in a single object than it will not work with the formControl. you can use[(ngModel)]instead. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 1st and 2nd Angular y u no gief singleton 
solution: 

issue: question what is an observable mainly used for? 
solution: apart from a bit of a learning curve. 

issue: who habe been working with webpack and webworkers and svg? 
solution: 

issue: How do I add a catch to a mapped list of Observabes? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: can I string observables together in a way that guarantees they come back in order? 
solution: I havemyService.translate('somestring')I want to feed it three different strings and get them back in order and add them to an array.... can you show me or link me an example of this?. 

issue: Is there any way to pack up an angular2/4 app in less files? 
solution: EreckGordon: so I get a bunch of js like polyfills and css etc. Is there any way I can bundle my app in one html file, or 1 js 1css and 1 html?. if you didnt want cli to bundle it, you could probably have it split files however you want to setup your custom config. but at what benefit, ya know?. 

issue: How do I loop only once? [<-CODE->] 
solution: It’s coming from anhttpcall.entryRows = [{foo: ‘bar’, can: ‘haz’}]. 

issue: what will be the good tutorial for angular 4 
solution: yes i have gone through angular.io. in my current company they gave me two weeks of time  to learn angular and start working. is this time good for learning and start working?. 

issue: You can always create a script tag in whatever component uses it? and append that to the header? 
solution: 

issue: But how fast is it to do a refresh? 
solution: excluding reflow. 

issue: besides SEO, what are the other benefits of using Universal? 
solution: faster load times. j0hnskot: fast initial load. => more people. 

issue: has anyone used chartjs successfully? 
solution: teomaragakis: This [<-LINK->]. teomaragakis: You can install it using npm likenpm install chart.js --save. 

issue: so change it? object is a reference 
solution: you will mutate the object though. 

issue: so .basically you don't test services that depends on backend? 
solution: Ravencrow: You test services by mocking out the http code, you don't test the http code itself. Same goes for ws, you test everything about your application, but not the ws itself.. 

issue: Hello all 
solution: return this.httpClient.post<UserModel>(this.controller, model).catch(this.handleError);. 

issue: Why's it so quiet here? Some Murica holiday? 
solution: Toxicable: even now when you attempt to say something, it's so full of typos it's difficult to decipher :P. If I was good at typing then i'd be some sort of person who types things out. 

issue: I found any adding to the form triggers a valueChange event. 
solution: also it's funny becauseaddControl will throw if the control doesn't exist. 

issue: Can someone tell me the advantage and disadvantage of using ngx-datatables as opposed to just rolling your own table component? 
solution: Could you give some examples of what is hard about datatables? We’re just now starting to display some amount of data. Looking to learn from you guys what I would be getting myself into by rolling our own table component. 

issue: ask@lazarljubenovic 
solution: ghetolay: this was evil. I had nothing else on mind. ghetolay: you know sanitization triggers me. sanitization = satanization. 

issue: you can async await an observable? 
solution: or just accept that itll fill in shortly after being initialized. 

issue: Hi all 
solution: MurhafSousli: if you need programmatic way to handle styles. 

issue: lazar was pretty angry earlier 
solution: lazar is always angry. he purchases a new keyboard every other week.  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Not used them together myself but check out: [<-LINK->] 
solution: All goods broski. I got an initial barchart comp done using d3. 

issue: are observable patched by zone.js ? 
solution: 

issue: what !? 
solution: ghetolay: yeah. make sense. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] is where i would start. dunno if theres a more angular answer for you. 
solution: EreckGordon: I used theRouterservice to handle the use case. and not1if you've reached the page after navigating from some page in the ap. 

issue: what 
solution: 

issue: is there some css guru ? 
solution: 

issue: so is there seriously no way to do template inheritance in angular?nope this is call components 
solution: 

issue: what's the difference between markForCheck and detectChanges? MarkForCheck does mark all the parents for a check and detectChanges does it only on current component? 
solution: This is where it's confused to me.detectChanges runs change detectionFrom the app root, down the whole component tree?markForCheck marks a parth from the root down to that detector for when CD is next runNext CD will run only on this marked path?. 

issue: Hello! How do I return values properly when I have to wait for data?  [<-CODE->] 
solution: Tiaryn: Or even better might be to work with Observables all the way, since it's everywhere in Angular, instead of going for Promise.If so use.subscribe()orAsyncPipewhen you finally need the actual value. 

issue: made a new virtual scroll [<-LINK->] 
solution: so in that example all 100 items are visible?. 

issue: Is the ReflectiveInjector an injectable dependency?  I think I have only injected the Injector, which now makes sense 
solution: It seems to create a custom injector that isn’t linked to the root injector.  But I guess I can follow the rabbit trail and see who’s using that code in the compiler or core.. 

issue: mock? 
solution: looks like plunker has http version too. 

issue: those are not AOT compatible, right ? 
solution: i mean web elements etc. well they could be delivered as a JS module, not as a typescript module you could tree shake etc... But as long as you don't mind the whole source included, i guess you can consider it AOT compatible. 

issue: robust, verbose, not really working also buggy in safari and not really that performant in chrome 
solution: Like if I wanted a div to grow and rotate it seems as if I'll have to mock the end frame in css. 

issue: similar [<-ISSUE->] ? 
solution: more related to that related issue in in. i was searhing for 201, ha, he noticed it with 202 and 204. 

issue: Any mongo expert here by any chance? 
solution: I have a large collection storing time stamps i have data coming if i have 100k values every second from sensors i end up having millions of records. Aggregating such a large collection took 40 seconds to get a weekly overview. So i decided to split my data and put it all into one document for each day. So the query performance is now ok. How ever i run into an another problem with bulk insert i get dupicate key error. 

issue: hey anyone herE? 
solution: i guess you are in the wrong place@sahilkatia. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] ? 
solution: from the docs I see it's RC. changelog *. 

issue: any ideas/patterns of how to getMyModule.forRoot()(no args) behave the same asMyModule, without duplicating lots of code? is it even a good idea? 
solution: if you could just make it work from an app without touching server, it would be pointless to have cors as a term in the first place. 

issue: Not in an offline environment? Could try update jasmine maybe? 
solution: but I’m running everything via webstorm. 

issue: bastiankhalil: that depends - what are you observing? 
solution: bastiankhalil: currentTitle = new Subject<string>();:). the subject is not getting previoues value. previous*. so it is no immediately tigger the new value.. I think coz it uses .next() shit!!. 

issue: lazarljubenovic: what's that http error you were having? alex is here and talking about it 
solution: i think we need "treat empty body as null" as a flag at least. yeah basically httpClient expectjsonas reponse while users seems to expectjson | null.. 

issue: you want a ReplaySubject or BehaviorSubject 
solution: just want to detect the change of a value on a serviceif you're not comfortable with rxjs for now you can just use a setter. i\'ll have write an open letter to all recruiters that i\'ll never accept a job which looks for "an ng2 developer". #itsJustAngular!!!. 

issue: what is this, jQuery? Sure 
solution: 

issue: Hello,does anyone needs free employ for angular 2 and node projects? 
solution: I mean@lazarljubenovicthat i will work for free. 

issue: gg boys 
solution: :). so whats the question. just trying to convert a component to a directive. 

issue: Hi, What is it for@ngrx/store? Because I see that when I set a state, it doesn't preserve if I refresh page, so I could use directly localStore... 
solution: furyscript: ngrx is for managing states on your app as it lives. It doesn't save and restore state automatically but should be easy enough to do. 

issue: Any example of a reactive form with a select input that select a default value??? 
solution: lazarljubenovic: it\'s not as bad as it might appear, in some ways I actually prefer writing in tests, things tend to be more "predictable". 

issue: holly: this may help [<-LINK->] 
solution: ahh got cought this oneExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError: Expression has changed after it was checked. Previous value: 'false'. Current value: 'true'. yeah, i think so. i know whenever i recommend changeDectorRef.detectChanges() i usually get my hand slapped, so there may be a better answer. 

issue: how do you provide it ? 
solution: it seems like code inside forRoot is completely ignored, i've tried changing the es5 file that im using in node_modules to lots of different things. 

issue: the error tells you why? 
solution: 

issue: ImRonBurgundy? 
solution: i think i've got it :). when you solve it let us know. 

issue: Man we get so ripped off in Australia. have to pay AU$200 more for the same phone after conversion 
solution: plus you get a free mini home, just after I brought one recently. Man it sucks. 

issue: how can i get access to AoT pre-compiled components factories in runtime? anyone for jit/aot issue? 
solution: 

issue: GM Fabian 
solution: in this when this assetCategoryList ===TSHL and infratelId===10227 so generate alert but i am getting alert on whichever values i am selecting. 

issue: Hi guys just a general question, I'm new to angular and wanted to know, is it ok to access dom elements in your components and manipulate them there, because with ElementRef documentation there is a clause: Permitting direct access to the DOM can make your application more vulnerable to XSS attacks. Carefully review any use of ElementRef in your code. 
solution: rohitsodhia: basically in my app there are divs generated dynamically by angular material, they have class names but no id which I need to give them, so I fetch them via document.getElementsByClassName and give them ids. So basically my manipulation is giving the elements ids, in this case.. rohitsodhia: no it's because I am using a 3rd part library that expects an HTMLElement returned from document.getElementById, the only way that I could achieve this was by first fetching the elements via document.GetElementsByClassName which returns and HTMLCollection of type Element then give them ids and fetch them again via document.GetElementById which returns an HTMLElement type that I can pass through to the method. It seems very hacky but it is the only way I could figure out how get it working.. 

issue: yarn is great, i've never had it ask me to choose a suitable version. 
solution: 

issue: you're missing comma here do you have interceptors ? 
solution: broweratcognitecdotcom: only a 404 from backend (which is correct, simulating a broken call). Could it be that Http can't handle OPTIONS errors?. 

issue: so that's your local name for your input array. 
solution: 

issue: Any idea to manage token in Angular 4 ? 
solution: s3chuongvo: So an identity token of some sort?. I implemented the function to relogin when token expired, but It does not work. 

issue: hi@Toxicable I have a structure like this [<-CODE->] but the style is never applied i may be stupid but just stcuk on that solution from yesterday any help 
solution: 

issue: when should you use Observable and when should you use Promises? 
solution: borriej: i would use observables for streams of data that change over time, and promises when i need to enforce syncronicity via async/await. the .map returns a new object, so when you dont assign it to a new variable, it is "lost". 

issue: how often is a major release? 
solution: Means the team can continue to bring in all these new features as fast as we're learning them. I feel like Angular is in perpetual beta at times. 

issue: Good morning bad day? 
solution: especiall bad timing on friday when you about to finish work. 

issue: may I post code here? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. :-). Way to go@darkedges!. 

issue: Does it make sense to have a base http service and other services extending or DI the Base 
solution: Would@itmake sense to have a base http service and 3 services to wrap the endpoints?. If it is 1 API with 3 different endpoints then it makes sense to have 1 service with 3 functions that use the injected Http service.. 

issue: are there any docs on this now? 
solution: afaik, schematics isn’t a new thing is it?. it's kind of new in the CLI. it's the result of the promise for customizable blueprints. nodi meant, schematics itself has been around awhile, it’s not entirely a new google thing. 

issue: What does this "rc.1" mean in angular version v5.0.0-rc.1? 
solution: Fanaticys: don't over think it. It is simply a couple releases before the official release. feature complete, just checking for bugs. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Doesnt work with this [<-LINK->] 
solution: instead ofself. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: i think it is embeddable, ive seen stackblitz templates in medium articles. lazarljubenovic: Is it also possible to make typescript classes to be dynamic like on-the- fly compilation of Components class? Most of the articles are limited to dynamic compilation of templates.. 

issue: Should I be importing observable fromObservableorrxjs? 
solution: 'rxjs/Observable'. rxjs/Obseravble. if you dorxjs/Rxthen it'll pull in all of rxjs. cli even adds a forbidden import'rxjs'. 

issue: maybe someone of you can help me with that: I think it's an angular problem...  [<-LINK->] 
solution: again, you are not saying how do you put CSS and what are you styling. What i meant is that if you change width/height via JS for example, then paint is not called again, thus not resized. 

issue: how to use decorators in functions i've done it before... 
solution: you cant place a decorator on a function outside a class. you can place it on param. like use a decorator inside a function. 

issue: doesn't angular i18n work for you? 
solution: well i am a bit hesitant now to move to angular 4.. don't use outdated plugins :). 

issue: Is this frowned upon? I can't think of any other way [<-CODE->] 
solution: this.router.events.mergeMap(() => .... 

issue: can you get the previous value from valueChanges somehow? 
solution: then .pairwise operator to it. + a.startWith([null, this.value])if you need the first change from nothing. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] looks like it was updated recently. i use firebase for my auth, so cannot really comment how good that library is. 
solution: 

issue: Can any one suggest me the best source to study java script ? 
solution: There is no way to say there is a best way to study js. like i do best watching some video randomly and then just trying to program, others need to study. 

issue: an observable with a subject? 
solution: 

issue: What did I just read? 
solution: I feel like angular after angularjs makes a lot more sense. 

issue: how do i get both controls within[dir]directive? 
solution: 

issue: Who's excited for v5? 
solution: 

issue: well does data exist on that class outside of the uploader? 
solution: some of that code looks angularjs'y. 

issue: because you never know when a URL will be a float? 
solution: frederikprijck: ... errrr... yes, I was hoping by choosing a float as my example for a url, the sarcasm would be thick enough :p. 

issue: Hey folks, is it possible within my tests to create a rejected promise that isn't caught by the zone? 
solution: Running functions via runOutsideAngular allows you to escape Angular's zone and do work that doesn't trigger Angular change-detection or is subject to Angular's error handling.. 

issue: Anyone got webpack-bundle-analyzer to work in an angular-cli project? 
solution: Toxicable: I could not find a way to set the host and port of the web server they use to show the report. I'm on a login server. It defaults to localhost which won't work for me.. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] are you looking to interact with the yelp api through your server? 
solution: i would assume you would want to do through server rather than client due to secret key being needed.. 

issue: Hi Guys just joined over from slack 
solution: I need to know how to access a expoerted function in my app.module file that it still passed the prod build process. 

issue: Hello. Am i in right room for Angular2/4. Tnx 
solution: Also glad that i found out for this community and from what i see its quiet active.. 

issue: you  want webpack to do the code splitting@lazarljubenovic? 
solution: The production build also supports lazy loading with Closure Compiler.. 

issue: Is there anyone here dealing with a hybrid app? I love the view encapsulation of Angular, and I would be very happy to use the global AngularJS style sheets only on the AngularJS components. But... the hybrid tag is an directive tag which can't contain styleUrls :( 
solution: Is there anyone here dealing with a hybrid app? I love the view encapsulation of Angular, and I would be very happy to use the global AngularJS style sheets only on the AngularJS components. But... the hybrid tag is an directive tag which can't contain styleUrls :(Nobody?. 

issue: What's wrong with the clis env config? 
solution: Toxicable: the environment.config is known configuration.  This is application-level stuff.  specifically the oidc client id and various endpoints.  if those change I don't want to change them in multiple places.  this way all I need in env is the api base and everything else is handled. excellent question... the only specific reason I can think of comes back full circle to the entire conversation from today... if a url starts withapiBasethen the http interceptor kicks in and adds a bearer token from the request, but it needs to know where to request the token from, which is why I need this info available on app startup.... also, I want to know how to generally add ad-hoc javascript like that in case i need other variables to be loaded for whatever reason in my anti-clickjack code, or my browser detection code... really just general non-angular specific javascript that I may want to add to the page. 

issue: hi guys, how to do something like that in TS ? [<-CODE->] 
solution: yes I’m also asking on the TS channel but it’s very quiet there. 

issue: I think the issue is on the parameters of the constructor@epimeth, the second parameter in specific 
solution: ```import {NgModule, ModuleWithProviders} from '@angular/core';import {CommonModule} from '@angular/common';import {HTTP_INTERCEPTORS} from '@angular/common/http';import {AuthInterceptor} from './auth.interceptor';import {AuthService} from './auth.service';import {InjectionToken} from '@angular/core';import {environment} from '../../environments/environment';export const APIURL_TOKEN = new InjectionToken<string>('apiUrl');@NgModule({  imports: [    CommonModule  ],  declarations: [],  providers: [    {      provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,      useClass: AuthInterceptor,      multi: true    },    {      provide: APIURL_TOKEN,      useValue: environment.apiUrl    }  ]})export class AuthModule {  static forRoot(): ModuleWithProviders {    return {      ngModule: AuthModule,      providers: [AuthService]    }  }}```. 

issue: is Nrwl Nx an alternative to cli ? 
solution: think it is built on top of cli. but havent dug in to really speak intelligently. DI is more suitable for that. ghetolay: eventually they want to be the same thing. 

issue: provider issues? again? :) 
solution: 

issue: what's the command to keep unit tests running all the time, not npm test? 
solution: 

issue: Typescript is a superset of js So there's more commands 
solution: I cant easily access these from ts. 

issue: what is the principal differences between angular 2 and 4? 
solution: 

issue: is there a clean way to implement anInjectionTokenthat is dependent on a RxJS Observable result? 
solution: I need to make an API call to get some data and then based on that information, I need to map information to what's available in the cookie object. right now, since I am only needing to deal with the cookie, it works great as anInjectionToken.  Now that I need to deal with having to call an async operation THEN deal with the cookie it's no longer sync lol. 

issue: I can't see the heart emoji :C 
solution: ericmartinezr: because you're a heartless monster. 

issue:  [<-ISSUE->] <3 Give the issue some love, people! Super-important! 
solution: Size loss is great too, but having an error code that you an google or have an error page with examples of what most commonly causes it is priceless. 

issue: there should be a report button 
solution: that too. 

issue: Hey whats the best way to implement datasource with a service? 
solution: 

issue: Any way of reacting to a pre NavigationStart event? 
solution: If a guard is doing something async for example, no other router events will be emitted. 

issue: I am@CamusAran, why ? 
solution: The way your angularjs application are set up also affect how confusing it is. I use [<-LINK->] for angularjs projects, which makes it move closer to angular when it comes to the setup.. 

issue: What's the point of the@Optionaldecorator? if a parameter is optional, why not just use ? 
solution: and in hindsight, asking  a question where I end with a question mark as a command rather than to ask is confusing :p. 

issue: Is there any way to stop or prevent the second re-rendering when using Universal? This seems to be related: [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: random question what's aresolvedo 
solution: Inter Process Communication. xD. JS in the browser dosen't have processes. 

issue: any fun plans? 
solution: assignments like school?. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: that's just a debugging attribute. but either way that's the wrong wya to go about doing it. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] that's probably firing after the component has been destroyed, which would indicate smething's not getting cleaned up as expected 
solution: as i said, this was largely to learn new methods;@Toxicablewas really helpful in understanding some of the process yesterday. 

issue: Any clue why i am getting this?  [<-LINK->] I did ng build --prod and then wanted to see if its working on my server 
solution: 

issue: Wondering if somoene can help me figure out this project? there is a window interface, but i dont see how it's being implemented... [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Is it bad idea if i make production on ng server? so they access via :4200? 
solution: Because auth0 has problem on deploy. This is real problem that i am having. All works well on ng server but login doesnt work on prod server. 

issue: is it even possible in aot? 
solution: lazarljubenovic: it is, but you cant provide routes which are then lazy loaded and expect them to work. lazarljubenovic: I don't know, but it's something you can do either wya. 

issue: does onPush change the behavior? 
solution: Hmm. I wonder how I inadvertently avoided that.... 

issue: In Rxjs, Is there any way to watch for changes of a single primitive variable? 
solution: But properties of an object can be 'watched' via setters and getters, does Rxjs provide any helper?. 

issue: somebody can explain this? [<-LINK->] 
solution: di3orlive: if you have an error i'd prefer you to describe it. Toxicable: i have map component, inside router-outlet, that working fine as you see - without material sidenavand if i just move all content inside sidenav then map component cant find element by id. (onInit):/i try also AfterViewInit same thingonly AfterViewChecked that runs many times can see element after 2 times. 

issue: :) 
solution: neat, but i really hate that now you have to provide an additional token for every custom control. 

issue: in aot? 
solution: 

issue: on 1.4.7 ng serve is failing to recompile files after certain errors occur. Is anyone else encountering this? 
solution: and screw it, i give up on this recaptcha code, don't know why it's not working, and after 4 days of being stuck on stupid things, i tired of it... can't figure out the package either, gave information there, hope it'll work out. 

issue: Hey all, is there an example formd-menuandclassList? 
solution: 

issue: how can i require for recaptcha ? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: how do you arrange component folders in a module? assume if there is a directory component which has file component will they be at the same level? 
solution: sajeetharan: You can arrange them in however way you like.. Just make sure they reside undersrc/appfolder. I prefer grouping component folders based on particularconcern. In my current project I have around 10 components and they are structured like [<-CODE->] and so on. Just a note.. If you're using CLI and want to place newly generated component at a certain location (example, under Content Component in Playground), you can specify relative path to the generate command like [<-CODE->]. 

issue: Hey guys I’m watching an rxjs vid and the guy is saying to avoid using Subjects 
solution: Not that subjects are evil, but if you can avoid them it's going to turn out cleaner.. Often you can achieve the same result by chaining observables correctly.. seekheart: ... because Subject can play on both sides ... and this is a bit danger in many situations ... so you have to switch it to an observable viaasObservable().... 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: EreckGordon: those arrows look like claw marks. lazarljubenovic: hmm you have been doing this long enough to know, a class is definition. Objects can be returned. 

issue: nobody want to help me? 
solution: cleartime: ... ^^ it is true ... you need to read some doc on the topic also.. 

issue: can I add somehow a fallback route? A page where I can redirect my app instead of page that cannot be activated? 
solution: castamir: the CanActivate guard could set a property of a service which causes the CanDeactivate guard not to ask again. dklmuc: problem is more generic.. I generally dont know where I am going... I have a component that reacts on its deactivation. I cannot know where I am navigating to and so I cannot know what guard of guards handle this behaviour (redirects). castamir: then let the canDeactivate Guard set the service property (so it knows that it has already asked for leaving). easiest way should be using a string with the component name, so you wouldn't need further logic for resetting this property. 

issue: how to get live traffic on this 
solution: On Map I f we wanna go from one place to another place they will show the traffic with colored red orage and green.. 

issue: programming in a nutshell 
solution: in a good language, truthy is the set of the following values:. i was about to brag about Clojure, but the lisp story of the empty list being nil-y would get me into trouble (though clojure fixed that one). 

issue: all: can you help me with this one [<-LINK->] 
solution: texirv0203: stop spamming@all. texirv0203: ... and don't spam all Gitter channels .... Toxicable: @mlc-mlapiscan you help me...by mistake I used all. 

issue: is''a valid route of':id'? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, how to reload page after http post submitted in same page? Any idea? 
solution: Iamguy84: there isn't a concept of reloading a route. Usually you just subscribe to the irl params and update the view on that. 

issue: Are there any Googlers around? 
solution: tjpeden: unfortunately I can't look at it right now, will do later.. 

issue: what other channel did you ask in? could use some more channels to lurk in. 
solution: i always have 10+ notifications because i never keep track of them.  [<-LINK->]. could always use more channels. 

issue: Hello guys, there is any angular-cli dev here? 
solution: alxhub: Man, i\'m in the build process and i need to fingerprint the "/assets" files. I know that angular-cli doesn\'t provide a native feature for fingerprint the "/assets" files. For this reason i\'m using a broccoli plugin instead. 

issue: what do you deploy to your server? the whole repo? 
solution: it basically installs devDependencies and then runs:npm run heroku post-buildand then runsnpm run start. well it looks like something isn't picking up the tsconfig properly. or somethign to do with global installs maybe. 

issue: So another rxjs question. A tutorial (on async validators) has this: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: I donno why I didn't think about this, but the NYC google office has an Angular meetup... 
solution: Alex, you seem like a great guy to ask about this: is there a major downside to using a more advanced version of typescript than that prescribed by Angular CLI?. 

issue: tjpeden: this is tracing log before the error: [<-CODE->] tjpeden: ... relevant source code [<-LINK->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: mlc-mlapis: check this out though, the aux component in this situation is listening to the routes.... i may be missing something, but i think that's the fix. basically i am assuming thatthe aux router outlet does not care that it is being formed as a child of the main routerso am re assigning that implied:idto the outlet. 

issue: is anyone here good with CORS? 
solution: well, cors doesnt usually apply to angular, but whats up?. 

issue: does that file exist at that URL? 
solution: I suspect it appends ".js" to some import, But I did not find anything importing /operators except in Rx.js. 

issue: said for the 19482'th time yeah, no naming confusion 
solution: 

issue: Array handling? 
solution: yeah, it bugs out on nested arrays. there's an issue on it, and being worked on.. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] I want to change thengIf condition to positive like `ngIf="show==‘FirstName’"&*ngIf="show==‘LastName’"` 
solution: rohitsodhia: Checking multiple values for identifying a single element is a problem….I think there might be a straight forward solution. If it is true… It is no use… Only if a condition is false…. I insert the template in the location. 

issue: I'm wanting to use the[formControlName]directive to dynamically add the component without polluting the markup. 
solution: third774: but then the problem is, your app has no way of knowing where to actually put the error messages..... 

issue: what does this.apiService.get do / return ? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] how do i bind a sanitized value? and why does it even need sanitizing? 
solution: I think it only needs it when you use multiple transform operation. 

issue: oh, is that the v5 stuf fyou were talking about earlier? 
solution: 

issue: Btw this error cannot be caused if frontend side is ok? 
solution: somehow it doesnt pass value in id. 

issue: $7/mo isn't very much, and it is supporting a community that supports open source 
solution: 

issue: +1 
solution: 

issue: never be sorry when the alternative is a dead channel 
solution: FU firestore. 

issue: Hi chaps - quick question. Does anyone know if patchValue in a reactive form will add the respected items when pushing into a FormArray? or will it not do that itself? 
solution: So I would manually need to go through and add the formgroups into the formarray in order to show all the items?. 

issue: ' 
solution: 

issue: you can do this using models on angular on reponse you can map the data with your model defined 
solution: 

issue: guys! 
solution: besides you're a computer too. howthis.router.navigate(['registration'])have no call. 

issue: is there some option inwriteFileto create the directory if it dosen't exist? 
solution: Toxicable: you want mkdirp for that, it handles all parent dirs. this is for the universal-starter, i'd prefer to not add more modules if I can. 

issue: how could i provide a object to a component without importing it? 
solution: is it possible to inject a constant?. 

issue: how do i get a component method to fire from the subscribe function? 
solution: wow, it's not firing. so weird.. i thought so.  weird.. 

issue: Any solutions?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: If i cant use ngFor what should i use to display it inside {{server.title}} ?. NemanjaDragun92Git: ... and mapped id vectors that you can use for things like re-ordering, filtering, ... and still keeping the objects in their native form. 

issue: hey guys any ideea why i get this error  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: let's say that we have a domaindomain.comandsubdomain.domain.comDo local storage ofdomain.comaccessible fromsubdomain.domain.com? 
solution: 

issue: ye .... I not setted up SSL cert myself on server before, but I think it require private key for decryption of requests, so, they stored and can be reused 
solution: 

issue: are you subscribed before you emit ^ yeah that 
solution: well, thethis.facebookLoggedInSubject.next(true);happens once the promise is done. 

issue: How do create a global function.I have a AuthService with a method isLoggedIn() that will return true or false.How would i use this in the html of another component. 
solution: 

issue: what are you trying to do? 
solution: 

issue: is that what redis is for? 
solution: 

issue: i just started playing with [<-LINK->] and it seems pretty simple and powerful  [<-LINK->] 
solution: EreckGordon: ... just started or are you able to judge a bit if it is suited well for Angular?. mlc-mlapis: every time i have asked the channel their opinions on it i get silence. so i started playing with it and think it will be good enough to replace firebase (no realtime, but it will work with universal at least). 

issue: Good morning 
solution: robertbrower-technologies: 'llo. robertbrower-technologies: balkan is on fire, but that's not really new. 

issue: thats why we're here 
solution: 

issue: Does anyone have a favorite intermediate level CSS course? 
solution: peterbsmith2: hmm. i do that. i just spend way too much time not figuring it out. i must be missing something. 

issue: How can I add prefix to styles using ngStyle? 
solution: i remember a guy tryingto fix sth about it a year ago tho, not sure what was wrong. 

issue: they're generaly suited towards bug reports 
solution: but the content of the report is suited towards it. 

issue: anyone using loopback here? can someone tell me , how to use node modules in loopback.js? 
solution: 

issue: I'm seeking some advice. What do you guys use to perform operations on a database? Do you just write the sql statements yourselves or use an ORM? 
solution: you can use ORM for simple requests, and you can use hand-crafted queries and stored procedures where performance is critical. 

issue: hello Somebody has an idea on this issue? [<-LINK->] 
solution: had that issue with@Output() select-- event fired automatically when I was selecting text inside component(or it was input, don't remember). alxhub: hmmm... then it must be somehow related to something else... I was thinking my interceptor, but I removed that and it was still happening.  can I somehow track down the circular dep?  angularjs used to tell me exactly what module was causing it... not so much any more.. 

issue: How's it going? 
solution: Bad news of the day is that I had to do some work this morning in AngularJS :(. and it is not very nice to read or follow.... 

issue: today's v5 release  hopefully 
solution: mmm probably not. I think it still needs another week. there's a bunch of issues with v5 right now. 

issue: does it matter adding a modifiers - i.e public - to input or output? If so, what modifier should be used? 
solution: always use public (or nothing, which is public). because if you use private, your AoT compile will fail. so feel free to just say@Input() blah: number;. 

issue: ok, since I had to defer injection ofsomething,somewhereI just did it in the ErrorInterceptor... that worked out.  I wonder why what I did above didn't work, tho? 
solution: 

issue: Hey is this the right place for a beginners question? 
solution: 

issue: Hi 
solution: But when I dong build --prod, it shows error "Cannot determine the module for class classname. Add class to NgModule to fix it. 

issue: Should  I include my services(API calls) in my core module or my shared module(Iam using Lazy Loading) ??? 
solution: @Toxicable ThanksI have another query… For my unit tests… How should i include my services in my component.spec.ts ? Then? Iam not supposed to include core modules in my spec.ts right ?. 

issue: any news for angular 5 final? 
solution: alxhub: gimme a hand here,isPlatformBrowservsif(window && window.whateverMethodYouWantToUse). 

issue: how to use breadcrumb in angular4 
solution: "use" ?. you need to create them :P. coderishu:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Anybody have any suggestions for module loading based on authentication state, but using the same route path? 
solution: Toxicable: best way is to require a non-empty path on one of them huh? That's kinda what I was gathering but I've been so set on this I've wanted to figure out a way otherwise. 

issue: i have an array filter in a subscribe block. i can console log a variable in the subscribe above my filter, but i'm getting undefined errors for the same variable in the filter block. anyone have an idea why? 
solution: epimeth: i expect it to do what all my other components do. it doesn't seem significantly different from everything else that works. i reckon there is some angular magic going on with routing and lifecycle administration and whatnot. [<-LINK->] the source.. 

issue: i just spent $100 on cat food. what is this world coming to? thats a lot of cat bux 
solution: 2 but he couldnt pee so now i have to get all sorts of fancy food that costs 70 bucks for a bag instead of 20 from costco. 

issue: summed in Form Control i got it by using [(ngModel)].. how to keep the "Form Control" and "myModel" in sync for "calculated" field?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: Problem was because logout was inside ngOnInit of Login Component. i solved by this. and declared it to click of login btn. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] uuh so this doesn't work this way? complains about the type of LOCALE_ID 
solution: i was trying to instantiate a pipe form angular myself. 

issue: Why islastblue? 
solution: ericmartinezr: more like@ghetolay0 - DI 1. 

issue: is there any dataType which would accept only number without decimals? 2 is accepted but 2.1 is not accepted 
solution: sahilkatia: you want input validation. notsonotso: I want input validation where user can go for only number. 

issue: hey guys random but anyone know of a way to detect dom elements during a scroll event? 
solution: alxhub: and no way to get a directive selector match it\'s exportAs ? to get something like<my-cmp #el="htmlElement"></my-cmp>. 

issue: Hi can I poke some brains here? 
solution: I come from a react background, and one thing that I liked a lot was the render method would detect any changes in state and automatically make a change. In angular I would like to have the ability to trigger functions based on a change in a variable. 

issue: Can a Angular component destroy itself? How? 
solution: at the moment, my  child component tries to set a boolean value to false.. which the parent component uses to *ngIf show the child Component, but im getting a error:. (Expression has changed after it was checked. Previous value: 'false'. Current value: 'true'.). it's a component with input fields.. and if none of the 5 fields have a focus.. it should destroy. 

issue: in ng5, do forms support Observables within AsyncValidators yet? 
solution: I mean actual Observables, where value changes can change the validity - over time. 

issue: soo raw cod. would you have it again? 
solution: sushi has nothing to do with fish, actually. so trying to figure out where else does raw fish. seafood houses. raw bars. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] omg this is 10 years old 
solution: It's hard to do anything at the moment though. so the state is transfered. 

issue: universally annoying 
solution: i assume that demo was behaving like that because its twice the same request. makes sense, you ave twice the same request and angular caches it. and about the random number, aslo@Toxicablewhen i have arand = Math.random()and{{ rand }}, it doesnt transfer any state and just overwrites with a new random number. 

issue: neat. and that doesn't break the svg? 
solution: ill easily remove that string and keep it in a commit to revert it later. but seriously.... 

issue: What is this magical priority lsit you speak of? 
solution: in that case you can already use it with babel. no need to wait at all. 

issue: what did you have to change it to ? or that is still being decided 
solution: soooo no idea really but removing it fixes it (although now with curent setup im firing 6 requests :)). but that needs t be refactored anyway, its in the plans. 

issue: in case of cli what is chain that calledtsc? is it likengc-->tsc? 
solution: they use them directly so they can control certain things like holding the files in memory. 

issue: Really? Is there another way I'm meant to index? 
solution: NikolaJankovic: the js gods probably change things randomly to mess with us. 

issue: Any recommendation on where should i host my Angular App which supports mysql DB in same time? 
solution: Would VPS be good option? So i can even have RDP connection + store other things inthere too?. 

issue: did you import the ReactiveFormsModule? 
solution: I have importedFormControlandReactiveFormsModule. according to that error you have not. in a module. 

issue: Do you find this or this more readable ? [<-CODE->] 
solution: I am following tutorial from youtube, says can't find angular router but I defines it. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] whats the error? 
solution: Looks like you have some misspellings of HomeComponent and etc. 

issue: Camus what can you tell me about Sartre?

issue: while not super happy, id be ok with edge over all... just no more ie

solution: lexcaraig: ... you can guess.. mlc-mlapis: It worksThank you:-). mlc-mlapis: I used@Inputdecorator to use the other component variable, but it is showing undefined. 

issue: why not just use a subscription instead of the takeUntil? Is take until preferred? 
solution: you have to save every single subscription for each new subscription. jwsims: the takeUntil pattern is a way to manage your subscriptions. it still calls .subscribe() but does not force you to call unsubscribe but rather automatically unsubscribe upon component destruction. If you can, you should prefer the async pipe because it takes care of all of that stuff for you, but sometimes you need to manually manage subscriptions and then takeUntil comes in as a clean pattern. 

issue: How about Build Targets and Environment Files Can we specify url in there How would I reference it though? 
solution: 

issue: Hey Angular community <3 Does anyone know of a good e-commerce web shop using Angular? Like [<-LINK->] 
solution: haha@Jin-KI know it looks good but the "What\'s coming very soon" part concerns me a bit since it doesn\'t seem to have many contributions in the last 8 months and I\'d really want some more complete solution if that exists. GoNode5: food, if that matters? :D I want to customize it anyway but it should have some basics like a shopping cart, user management maybe some statistics etc.. 

issue: wonder how nativescript compares to flutter. i guess, the advantage is it is still angular so no learning something else. 
solution: working with widgets makes angular look rather lame.

solution: You need to serve up your index.html as thedefaultfallback route. any advise on where to look for http interceptors using observable?  My signature looks like this:. 

issue:  [<-ISSUE->] any idea? :) 
solution: 

issue: when do youexport as interfacerather thanexport as class when defining a type for an object 
solution: skalinic: ... they are eliminated for run-time JS, so they play their roles only for typing in TS.. 

issue: a and b are two objects [<-CODE->] how can i write this condition properly 
solution: sahilkatia: You would need a reference to thebobject.Try doing something like this: [<-CODE->].

solution: jplew: I already logged-in Yotube but it still says that video is restricted :( :(. 

issue: Is it good practice a fetch Pipe?

issue: I'm trying to get an input field to change type if the length of the input is greater than 0 but it looks like I'm not binding correctly to the field? Does anyone have a suggestion on how to improve this? [<-CODE->] 
solution: WilliamBowen: Right now, your'e jsut putting some text (which looks like javascript) into the type field. You need to either render it ({{}}), which isn't the right way, or bind to something. I don't think there is a[type]input though..

solution: Whenever I try to use the new lettable operators with HttpInterceptor its a fail. Cannot instantiate cyclic dependency! HTTP_INTERCEPTORS ("[ERROR ->]"): in NgModule AppModule. 

issue: what does your constructor look like? 
solution: steveblue: That didn’t work. I’m currently migrating everythign using a new scaffold. But maybe my export is wrong?. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] getting this error after upgrade from 4.1.0 to 5.0.0 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] ? 
solution: epimeth: I think the reason I found this code initially is because I was having a circular injection issue in the constructor and this allowed me to inject the actual class later in the cycle.. 

issue: losing the options at runtime :-P 
solution: but the question remains when design a 'model' in Angular would I use i with an interface or skip interface and just start with Class only. dklmuc: I want to make myself happy, I want to now what the required options are when using the class without knowing all the params by head.. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] sometimes it act as responsive sometime it doesn't Did I make any mistake 
solution: 

issue: ... OK, are able to confirm that the server side receives OPTIONS request from the client when trying to authenticate? 
solution: The server receives a post message with the credentials. Logs the user into DRF and sends a status response 200.. 

issue: is both solutions to that question fine?  [<-CODE->] why I am facing error in this? it says illegal constrcutor 
solution: sahilkatia: It also looks like a {} issue. 

issue: that's on you? responsive is based on your css for display, js for behavior, not angular 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] so why is this error Cannot match any routes? 
solution: If you are on "AutherizeComponent" & trying to navigate to "/auth".. Then angular doesn\'t load the component as you are already on the same page... 

issue: can i get the leaf activated route instead of the one at the level where the component is? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Why I am facing this error? 
solution: sahilkatia: use http://, use another secure source, serve it by yourself, use a proxy. 

issue: how do i access autoprefixer options through cli? and@ghetolaykeep your mouth shut 
solution: WARNING in ./.../shop-admin-products-new.component.scss(Emitted value instead of an instance of Error) autoprefixer: /.../shop-admin-products-new.component.scss:23:5: IE supports only grid-row with / and span.

solution: broweratcognitecdotcom: @alvipeoI've had it aswell, but been able to fix it everytime. Iirc It mostly happened (for me) when setting component values in AfterViewInit. 

issue: Does anyone use the angular cli for development in a big app without ejecting? 
solution: 

issue: this is from an experiment  for an shared resolver [<-CODE->] 
solution: instead of injecting a service into all your routed to components. this is cleaner. GoNode5: personally, if I had to do what you're doing, I would do it this way, and not worry in the slightest bit that I had to add a resolver to my routes. 

issue: make a stack blitz 
solution: is there any problem of setting null as the first value?. a stack blitz would be cool though. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] this is validation for one field in form

issue: hey guys! question on ngrx and showing global 'in progress' indicator. how should it be done? I may have multiple modules with their own state but the indicators is global 
solution: alvipeo:  [<-LINK->] it's covered there - but just have your global progress subscribe to the reducer so that when the action is 'SEARCHING' or whatever, it displays and when the status changes, it goes away. 

issue: Q or dynamically add resolve to an route? 
solution: well you can change route definition. but not just add the resolve. I have a shared resolver but have to add it manually to every route. 

issue: what css? 
solution: I think this might be an S3/CloudFront issue now. if the router navigates, css gets injected. first check dev tools if everything is loading fine or if you get 404. 

issue: hey, my angular app, more specifically a service that makes get requests is firing the same request multiple times in a lot of cases, does anyone know if this is normal behaviour? 
solution: juanlet: no, not normal behavior. If it's firing multiple times, in all likelyhood its because you're calling it multiple times without realizing it.. this.subscriptions =   this.sharedHelpersService.getCountriesList().subscribe((countriesList) => {      this.fullCountriesArray = countriesList.data;      this.filteredCountriesArray = this.fullCountriesArray.filter(        country => country.name == 'Argentina'      );    });only here, and in note js console I can see  requested_api_endpoint /api/general-services/get/countries/allnextrequested_api_endpoint /api/general-services/get/countries/allnextUna req {}sending countries listGET /api/general-services/get/countries/all 304 48.495 ms - -.

solution: 

issue: what is address ? 
solution: I don't see it on your snippets. 

issue: so each change (in of the 3 fields of each object) will change the values of the following objects? 
solution: depending on where you subscribe, you'll get the follow of that part of the form. If this is tabular form, then you can have a stream for each row, if that's helpful (sounds like it would be)@dklmuc@borriej. 

issue: morning? isn’t it like 8PM where you’re at? hmmm  where you at again? LOL 
solution: aaah gotcha… had it in my mind you were in germany there abouts lol. i know who’s couch i’m sleeping on when i visit NZ, invited or not lol. 

issue: pretty suredeletedoes not have a body

solution: dklmuc: like this (still empty)this.users = this.http.get(url).map(response => response['results']). 

issue: is there a way to fire (ngModelChange) .. after the model has changed? 
solution: mildfuzz: i want to iterate over the rows after that form field.. so i can update the next form values with a generic function... but because of the 'model change update bubble' the value this.myForm.get('endCount').value is not the same as the myChangeFunction(newValue). 

issue: anyone know of alternatives to [<-LINK->] weighing out my options to see whats best 
solution: 

issue: how do I avoid the lowercase of properties that I sent from the server camelcased? 
solution: I always used underscore names for json and I decided to try this. Either way angular dowent do anything around that. 

issue: services should go on providers 
solution: remove it from declarations. still no change. 

issue: I refuse to use modal's... :-) Happy Users. It's ancient Windows  UX 
solution: I don't like material, too heavymaterial is no way heavy, not to mention that you can use just angular/cdk, on which most components are based. 

issue: Why can't you use navigateByUrl and pass queryParams to it? It only works with navigate... 
solution: in my docs it shows:navigateByUrl(url: string|UrlTree, extras: NavigationExtras = {skipLocationChange: false}): Promise<boolean>extras is type navigationExtras but only accepts skipLocationChangelooks like they want to avoid the need of merging when giving params by url and extras ;-). 

issue: gross 
solution: I know. which class would work. 

issue: is there a way to bind an object to an input's value property, but actually display a property of that object? 
solution: @arun-awnics:Template like this: [<-CODE->] Controller like this: [<-CODE->] But rather than displaying "[object Object]" in the input, I\'d rather show the value of object.name ("Nick Sloan" in this case). 

issue:  [<-CODE->] why it says http client couldn't find? I already import in appCOmponent 
solution: sahilkatia: You have to import it everywhere you use it. sahilkatia: I think also the import of AppComponent is incorrect here. 

issue: Hey guys, quick question on@ViewChild,nativeElement.focus(), and ChangeDetection 
solution: I'd like to focus on a@ViewChild()element viangAfterViewInit(), but when I do so, it will cause ExpressionChangedAfterBeingChecked, because I am updating a template variable inngAfterViewInit. axal90: If you put your ``` on their own line it will format correctly.

solution: 

issue: Whats the difference betweendeploy-urlandbase-href?

issue: noone can help me? :(  [<-LINK->] the whole problem described... 
solution: MatthiasMiebach-Aracom: instead you could have switch over to angular cli... would have costed you less time. GoNode5: the problem is i want to migrate an already existing application, i just took the VS-Project as an example as it has the same problem. 

issue: In my project we use GA, events we push mostly are: "event": event,"eventcategory": eventcategory,"eventaction": eventaction,"eventlabel": eventlabel 
solution: GoNode: you can go for a single click listener, then check event.path to see which element got clicked all the way up to the root element (which is row i guess) and fire the event that suits best.You can use event capturing (fires before bubbling and goes "down" from window to element clicked) and stop propagation once it gets to row element..

issue: are there any considerations in regards to lazy loaded modules and change detection? 
solution: mlc-mlapis: I have a virtual scroll component. It works perfectly in the demo app that I developed the VirtualScrollModule in. I brought the component into my real app. And it behaves differently. The virtual-scroll-component should be able to handle changes to the list. And it does this very well in the demo app. In the chrome tools, I see only one element change when the@Input() items: Array<any> gets set because an item was added to the beginning of the list. But in my real app, all of the elements are removed and replaced. I'm stumped after spending a couple days on it, so I just wondered about the possibility of some side effects that might be caused due to the VirtualScrollModule being in it's own npm package and imported as a shared moduled into a lazily loaded module that gets loaded by the user on demand.. robertbrower-technologies: ... if I understand correctly ...VirtualScrollModulecontains onlyVirtualScrollComponentcomponent and it has@Input() items: any[] = [];.  This component ... supposesparent/childconcept because of@Input()and@Output(). So I don't think that there is a difference between using the conponent in lazy loaded module or eagerly loaded one if  keeping the sameparent/childprinciple..

solution: 

issue: how can I correctly override  http.get and post method [<-CODE->] 
solution: you are wrapping your http service. so I'm not sure what specifically youre confused on. 

issue: istiti: just interested why would you want to do that? 
solution: GoNode5: you directly use HttpClientModule .get() and .post() how you intercept all request  ? using new angular interceptor or what ?. GoNode5: and you how you intercept catch all call on post() and get() you directly user get and post of HttpClient module ?. 

issue: @broweratcognitecdotcomtrackBy 
solution: Toxicable: I confirmed it returns the id: number of the item. What could cause this to fail?. 

issue: on the node side of things, what's the most popular ORM? 
solution: says a bit of a chore with typescript though. since it generates methods, you need to make interfaces yourself. 

issue: Is there a link where i can give suggestions of clarification for the documentation? 
solution: I mean that in the documentation it's not mention when they decided to change from systemjs to webpack and what that implicates or how to migrate from one to another. they moved from system.js to the cli. 

issue: ContentChildren: cannot query RouterLink directive? 
solution: of course I have put an routerLink directive on <a> tag. 

issue: well what's the error? 
solution: 

issue: I have had something like that. I solve this by adding this property to object 
solution: i did solve this once. then one guy pulled my changes. and rejected. and did push back his whcih wasnt fixed. 

issue: so "contributing" is instructions on PRs and commit messages.... how do I actually go and build angular from source, locally?  I\'m getting please use Tarn instead of npm to install dependencies?    out of curiousity, why the heck was that decision made? 
solution: 

issue: how about the Aggregator ? 
solution: before emitting a new action. 

issue: hi  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] is giving this result in network but not in console? why anyone here? 
solution: 

issue: I'd be amazed if it wasn't 
solution: if you're not familiar with redux. you can also read a lot about redux. absolutely not familiar with redux. 90% common to ngrx. 

issue: Hey guys, what is your preffered way to do component inputs? One input object or multiple inputs as primitives? 
solution: :) I am asking because it seems a little awkward to use just one input object when using onPush strategy, since you have to provide new instance every time. That means you have to merge existing properties with new ones when updating that data. 

issue: what can i do if my ngFor is slow? 
solution: I think the rendering is taking too much time. zIAmMarci_twitter: suppose 5 rows and 5 columns based on input the user will givee. 

issue: :O 
solution: 

issue: what is the recommended way to change styles of the material components? I need to apply different flex layout to themat-list-itembut its not working 
solution: I think because of shadow dom my style rules are not visible inside component. 

issue: jamesbretz: ... so how do you imagine that<!--[if gte mso 9]>would be compiled by Angular compiler? 
solution: the end goal is to click that button, and a new window would open with that code by itself in an html file. 

issue: anyone? : > 
solution: dchoruzy: use the stackblitz at the top of the website to reproduce the error. dchoruzy: ... it has to be a timing problem ... you don't have the data in that moment yet. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Use the last compliant angular5 branch [<-LINK->] 
solution: xavierclotet: look for an alternative, this library does not have a way to avoid the token for specific requests (besides a global whitelist). @xavierclotet look for an alternative, this library does not have a way to avoid the token for specific requests (besides a global whitelist) try to use interceptors. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] works on development  environment , but doesn't works on build why ? 
solution: comeUpWithItLater: angular2 will render the DOM for you. Don't change the DOM, change your data and let the templates redraw themselves. You may need to do some more tutorials and look at event handling. 

issue: if I have an object stored in a BehaviourSubject...is it possible to update just a property or I have to getValue(), update the property and then do a next()?? 
solution: I think the meaning Observable is towatchchanges. This is exactly the case - property on the object changes and Observable make notice all subscribers that something changed - deal with it. 

issue: what is the response from the server 
solution: 

issue: hi do you know why # becomes %  in router  ? 
solution: I don't pm people. huh. when people msg me I tell them to use the public channel. 

issue: Ok, after updating my complete project to ng5, my switchMap is still failing without an error [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Anyone insight on to why the URL is undefined when I am splitting the route? 
solution: I think I fiugred it out it seems Angular 5 errors out not if something doesnt exist what Happens in angular 4 is that it would get to the NavigationEnd eventually but in Angular 5 it seems to error out. So switching it to filter it and make sure to get to NavigatioEnd works something like so: [<-CODE->]. 

issue: there is virtue in knowing how things work... CLI -1 
solution: fugwenna: I struggle with the same thing having to refactor my build every 6 months to reflect changes in angular. 

issue: why are they benchmarking with rollup + closure compiler? closure alone will be more performant 
solution: steveblue: I visit your personal site and my cores start spinning wth. The background is rendered in real time with a GLSL shader. 

issue: I am using angular material menu and I want to stop propagation of click event from it, any idea? 
solution: and menu button on it, I want list item to be clickable. You have a menu inside list ? and want to click them both ?. 

issue: anyone with any ng-packagr experience? 
solution: I just make a seprate directory for each package. 

issue: can anyone answer my question please? even if it sound a little bit dumb :( 
solution: farissi: If you usingng-smart-tablein a lot of places - go with global styles. If you using it in just one page - make the styles local. farissi: Most of the time people have some kinda 'theme' applied globally so all components look the same at all pages. 

issue: Has anyone been successful in referencing acomponentthat is part of its module byselector? 
solution: 

issue: public 
solution: get and set totally work. 

issue: Help please with universal. Where on the sernver I have to specify this id? [<-CODE->] must match between the client and server applications 
solution: I am long time trying to configure my project with angular universal. But I allways get some trouble.. 

issue: in angular, we have toolbar & sidenav,  no footer? 
solution: i knew i can create my own, but just want to knew if there are one for example : mat-footer :). but i dont knew where i can find the full list of component , animations .... 

issue: how can I chain observables, so I can execute multiple async tasks in order? Like we did using promisesPromise().then().then().then().catch() 
solution: ewaschen: I do not understand. Do you mean the type of your argument. In your service, you can domyFunction(arg: FormControl){}. 

issue: How can I have anEventEmitteremit a tuple of two types? 
solution: wachpwnski: I would emit an object with those two types inside. I don't need to pass the bucketlisting instance, but I don't want to make assumptions in it.. 

issue: Not Angular at all but im, looking for some node backend suggestions. Needs to be relational + self hosted 
solution: Toxicable: youre looking for databases?. 

issue: EreckGordon: i have a webpack build 
solution: lisacopeland: have you tried cli?.  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: who uses IE anymore? 
solution: just for information....  bcz we have very old client may be someone can use it. I would save yourself time and give up on IE.. Edge on the other hand should be the focus. 

issue: Does anyone test to see if a component fires an ngrx action? How do you test for it? 
solution: 

issue: html5 canvas? 
solution: there\'s nothing "popular" about it. angular is just a word. lazarljubenovic: That's a bit different the letter C is being used by everyone canvas is not, alternatives are webgl and svg depending on what you want to do. 

issue: Well you can't There is no localStorage on your service side, and if there was it would not match the user's. Fanaticys: that is 
solution: Because you want to store your token in the localStorage. You have to either keep it in memory, in a cookie (don't do this this is nineties style).. So localStorage is kept when you close your browser, but you can't read it on the server of course.. And if that was possible you'd do it wrong anyways because the localStorage would have been the same for every user using your app. You can store in in localStorage but make sure to only access that code on the client's machine.. 

issue: How about dumping it in a json file in the repo on prod build? 
solution: 

issue: Sorry to ask here for some "jquery" :PBut cheerio channel is dead...Any idea how I can get only 7,90   in: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: You are in the angular zone? playground: 
solution: Did you try the assert? If for some reason the components is loaded outside the angular zone it won't update. The component works elsewhere.@playground. 

issue: i have to write a unit test for one of my directives and it uses elementRef as a dependency injection in its constructor. when i create the directive in my test environment and I am injecting elementref I am getting this error. "Property \'nativeElement\' is missing in type \'typeof ElementRef\'." can anyone tell me how to get the injection working so i can test for it 
solution: 

issue: Hey everyone, is it ok to post a stackoverflow link in here? I need help with something 
solution: joejordanbrown: that could work, however I think it will be a bit tricky because the code I need to execute is in a function inside the component and can't be moved.. 

issue: You can't have two modules declaring the same thing. 
solution: so I could create shared module for each application that uses those feature modules. but it would make feature modules depend on something that is not declared within them. 

issue: isn't that supposed to be a Directive? 
solution: you can always disable tslint for that line in file if that selector is not so common in your codebase. 

issue: How should I generate mock backend for protractor e2e tests with angular 4+? 
solution: still salty over universal. i chuckled when someone wrote a whole wrapper for af2 because the dev team doesn't support ssr with a known timeframe. then they come back and say well i wish you would have contributed.. 

issue: Has anyone seen this kind of error and can tell me where to look? [<-CODE->] 
solution: In essence, you most likely explicitly exclude spec.ts files, for obvious reasons, you don't want them to be part of your production bundle. 

issue: doesng serve --aotgive any errors? 
solution: 

issue: any response to my error handling question? :-/ 
solution: well I mean you can doT extends SuperClass. but I don't think that's exactly what you want. I have tried <T extends Class1 | Class2> but it didn't work out. 

issue: buttt that's a directive, how will it render children? 
solution: 

issue: if the fileupload is a form control how does that work, is it separate or does the form builder support it in some way? 
solution: but aside from that to read it from the dom and into a FormControl you could probs use a ControlValueAccessor to do that. 

issue: I'm currently doing about 80% .Net (in my professional life). Looking to change that to more front end oriented asap 
solution: maybe, I don't think the back-end combination matters much. It works fine with Java, at least you don't have the weird CamelCase method names and such.. 

issue: Does anyone has experience with debugging an angular app on vscode? I cant make it work 
solution: oyekeno: I use the "Debugger for Chrome" plugin in VsCode and that works great. 

issue: Hi guys, how can I attach all attributes of my directive to a subelement ?? 
solution: you could do some voodoo with native element. but if you're looking for react/jsx thing with{...props}, nope. 

issue: if I declare an app-level service in providers, do i need to re-import that into each component? 
solution: 

issue: why does angular 4 need to change the directive names, *ngFor should've just stayed ng-repeat i'm so not into this but i have to learned!!! 
solution: justinemar: ngFor="let item of items"<=>for(let item of items) { }. justinemar: just think about angular material when they changed from md to mat. I do store it in a service but that still doesnt change the fact that the data is going to be reloaded from there.. 

issue: can you inject component into another component? I have a users array in com1 and I call a function from com2, so I would like to populate users in com1 
solution: nglifeis: As@paullryansays, you probably want to separate your business logic (keeping a list of users up to date) from your view logic (displaying those users in com1 and com1). Ideally you'd follow a pattern that uses smart components (for organizing other components and populating data) and presentational components (that literally populate a template and pass up user events via@Output). It's no accident that smart/presentation map directly to business logic/view logic. 

issue: the animation is fired by the chart lib? 
solution: yeah would be easier for them to have got a reproduction without the need of luck to get this error ;-). I had to jump back and forward several times between links before. 

issue: how to send username and a form object in a post request, any idea please ? 
solution: 

issue: won't work 
solution: 

issue: by installing webstorm :) 
solution: I am using google map on page. it have header also. but when I use header and google map together then google map doesn't appear on my page. 

issue: So I have an esoteric question. How can I inject ComponentFactoryResolver into my component WITHOUT putting it into the constructor? I've been able to do this with some services I have but when I use the same method for ComponentFactoryResolver, I see a sea of red compiler errors. ok so just out of curiosity, is ComponentFactoryResolver classified as a service? 
solution: Toxicable: The way I've been doing it is exporting a custom injector  and  setting it up in the constructor of app.module. This way I can still initialize my services in my component's constructor but it doesn't have to be a parameter. This is good because I don't want to have to keep satisfying the parameter requirement with every subclass. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] which is correct when I run it locally. but not when it's deployed... so, how can this be fixed? 
solution: 

issue: Anyone with some idea how animations work/ nvm, got it :D 
solution: and there aren't really any steps being taken to fix it, as far as I can tell. they are always showcasing cool animations on presentations... on the latest chrome. 

issue: lakhank: what do u mean with "refresh"? 
solution: 

issue: how would i set it to the currently selected items top ? 
solution: tried it the same way, doesnt work. it's working for me. on stackblitz? can u save and paste link?. 

issue: Did you provide the service and inject it? 
solution: i realize the part that was injecting it wasn't called onload. when i triggered that part, it logged. 

issue: It's working fine for me [<-LINK->] 
solution: I literally CAN scroll, but the handler is not being called. Very curious.. 

issue: the developer console each browser has? firebug is dead btw 
solution:

solution: 

issue: ng-if whats the correct *ngIF 
solution: sahilkatia1:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: can i write js function in angular 4? 
solution: 

issue: ghetolay:  [<-CODE->] 
solution: ?? Weren't you talking about viewChildren?. yes and how do you add / remove / move those children?. 

issue: good day everybody I have this error [<-CODE->] any idea? 
solution: GoNode5:  [<-LINK->] does not help?. 

issue: anyone can help please? 
solution: iamelru: Ahhh. I see. This is why the getting config info from the server seems like a fools errand .. 

issue: "because of size regression" [<-ISSUE->] :thinking: 
solution: in possible to run angular file in Xampp  server. 

issue: Hi any idea Angular4 child routes giving error "no elements in sequence" 
solution: Uhmmm... just found out that this was reported like a year ago [<-ISSUE->]. 

issue: how to convert xml to json 
solution: Sukhdeep143_twitter: i would think this falls out of the scope of angular.... Kiongku: actually i have api that return xml response. Sukhdeep143_twitter: what i mean is how to convert it itself is out of scope, and probably to get what you want you should “map” it from the httpclient get returns. 

issue: can anyone explain me why typescript sees my function as a property and not as a function ? [<-LINK->] 
solution: it is misleading with the typing to think that the object is truly that class, it is more like declaring the return of this http get will be in the shape of the class. if i do a map and object assign to a new instance of the class first, then it will behave as expected. 

issue: @Programazingcan you create minimal stackblitz? 
solution: I find it weird that just typing in "stackblitz" didn\'t turn up their website in the first few results. Anyway, it seems to be working now.. 

issue:  [<-ISSUE->] I'm facing this issue and have tried the suggested solutions which don't work for me...any suggestions? 
solution: I tried that. tried both actually. 

issue: is it possible to use get with async on function? 
solution: benydc: if the getter returns an observable you can do it. benydc: not a problem, you can use rxjs fromPromise operator. benydc: don't use getters like that. 

issue: is it possible to create a alertbox like this in ionic 3 ? [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: v5.1 outnow you can all use TS 2.5 :D 
solution: living on the edge. 

issue: Why do my models not allow me to use getters and setters in my angular app? 
solution: set foo(value) .... 

issue: Anyone here much more of a JS pro than I, I could PM a non-directly-Ang-related question too? 
solution: So I allow a use to upload a director of JSON Files (or objects). I then need to iterate through all of the files, and in the end have a CSV of the output.Simple json2csv logic, BUT due to it being random files, and a random amount, I'm struggling on the 'require' portion. I've never used glob but it seems to be what I need. I have it now at the point where it will inform me of 'all' files in the directory, but I can't iterate through the contents of the file.Anyone have recommendations on how I should leverage fs or glob(sync?) for this task?. 

issue: Can someone explain me why i get an error removeEmptyRows is not a function when i write this.collection.removeEmptyRows() ? [<-CODE->] 
solution: yeah i don't want to be static. i want to do something inside it. i want to remove elements from links array. 

issue: can a component@Inputfrom a component which is not it’s direct parent? 
solution: davidkarlsen: you can do stuff like expose Observables on services so the heiarchy between this component and that doesnt matter. so even if the item has a slight highlight and that fades away or something thats fine.... 

issue: How to compile dynamic html before adding to the DOM ? 
solution: if you want dynamic layouts then you can do something like this [<-LINK->]. IagoBarboza: no idea, could you make a minimal repro?. in other words, not subscribing to the wrog one. 

issue: syntax on html? 
solution: if you want an array. 

issue: How do i get a variable in to my url like this/something-{{id}}-something 
solution: dynamiccarrots: I think that would need to get the url and apply some regex to get the bit you want. If you use/something/:idyou can access it almost directly.. 

issue: Anyone use mdb-angular? 
solution: You have any issues with form line-ups formdb-selects?. dnorthrupva: let create an issue on github, I will tell the mdb team, I'm colab with them to improve mdb at this time. sandangel:  [<-LINK->] Is this there Gitrepo? Not even sure.. 

issue: what do you use to create your angular web app layout? 
solution: skiabox: ... after some time we decided to use now for one of our project.. 

issue: ghetolay: compiler here I mean the AOT compiler 
solution: it would be something like what we do with scss file before add it to inline style. 

issue: Hi Will path''and path/make any difference? 
solution: karthikaruna: /would be wrong (and I remember some iuser having problems with it)... path in route config is always "relative" to parent. karthikaruna: like I said: usepath: ''because that's the correct way of route configuration (because u also dopath: 'child' orpath: 'child/:id')And there was a guy 2 or 3 weeks here using/for an empty path resulting in multiple rendering of this route. 

issue: is there any example which shows how to compile the dynamic html ? 
solution: jbeckton: I used pipe for handling html sanitize. I am able to get a string with(click)=functionName()in it but click event is not working because its on compiled. 

issue: Hi guys, [<-CODE->] 
solution: basvandenheuvel: ... principallyindexis not a good solution, ... certainly item.id ... as primary key. basvandenheuvel: ... I don't use MD yet so ... but they use many extra things ... maybe they use also some extra syntax fortrackFnor even for*ngFor?. 

issue: What back-end are most of you using for your Ang project? 
solution: Problem with having 12 years experience in Rails, the non-'magical' routing will take me some adjusting too.. 

issue: hey guys I got a odd error and wanted to ask for some help 
solution: I’ve got a base Http Service that wraps httpClient, a EntityService that wraps that Http Service. 

issue: it's xml or html ? 
solution: DOMParser is for dom elements. 

issue: What is the good strategy to centralise the modal dialogs like alert, error and confirm should I create a shared modal-modules? 
solution: vivekimsit: not open source ^^ the docs are very good regarding the basics [<-LINK->] The whole structure depends on your project, there are various solutions where one can fit better than another one. For example we have got one core module (with components for header, footer, login, etc.), one big shared module (with all components which are shared) and then a lot of feature modules (which are lazy loaded). inside a feature module it's mainly splitted into form, list and detail components (+ further ones, but these three are nearly in every module).In short: the app is mainly structured after the nested routing. 

issue: is there a standard way to create angular 4/5+ bundles?  are most people using rollup? 
solution: 

issue: where does the disappear trigger occur? you're popping the values out with a click function, but I don't see it tied to your template at all. 
solution: 

issue: can I extend an imported namespace with implementation ? [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: I want to have types and implementation in namespace. You shouldn't need to write namespace files. I have declared them in namespace so that my types should not become global. 

issue: hi everyone, I am having error in my angular 2 project. can anyone help?  [<-LINK->] 404 (Not Found) 
solution: 

issue: Anyone know if there is a way for angular to split large files into chunks? 
solution: that means that option is optional, not means [] is required when you specify the option. 

issue: With the new HttpClient, how do I access the headers property of the response? it automatically parses it to a json object deleting the communication headers 
solution: timothyblue: but the interceptor resides below service level and I want to read the header only for one particular request (user-login with authentication data in the header). 

issue: anyone have any idea for http request for form upload? I have three params for that ? 
solution: And no, actually. You do have to hand it an object with the typing it needs.. 

issue: I'm migrating an existing project written in Jquery/ Vanilla to Angular, I'm trying to avoid accessing the DOM directly. I'm a beginner in Angular, I have this function: const SetNavigationsArrows = (()=>{ [<-CODE->] })(); How would be written in Angular the "right way"? Thank you so much :) I'm using ngx owl carousel and its component is a child component in another component. 
solution: 

issue: Morning.  The following template code works just fine [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: its a promise 
solution: 

issue: Injector types?  [<-CODE->] 
solution: juste fixed. const sharedService  = <SharedService>this.injector.get(SharedService);. yeah, orconst sharedService  = this.injector.get<SharedService>(SharedService);. you are the boss. 

issue: hi guys does anyone knows how can i use a lettable operator with takeUntil and then subscribe? 
solution: this.route.params.takeUntil(this.destroyed$).subscribe(params => {\n      this.getMenu();\n    });. 

issue: hey, anyone here who used ngrx selectors? 
solution: 

issue: Sorry anyone here from angularJS I am having small error? for http request in angularjs 
solution: So I thought might be here someone knows angularjs. 

issue: are "barrel" files discouraged still ? or can webpack deal with the sorting and all that 
solution: istiti: also code splitting is not a simple problem. istiti: I don't think you understand, abc is very new to the public and it's going to be ages before it's ready for our consumption.. 

issue: What library - is the library using HttpClient or the old http module? (list Restangular) 
solution: Yeah, it appears to be - looking now. 

issue: on a scale 1-10 how hard is it to migrate 4.3 to 5.x angular? 
solution: it's in imports (didn't paste all for clarity). not, no filter... it's supposed to handle every request. 

issue: If I have [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: chrillewoodz: when you click submit, call next() on an observable which you can debounce. chrillewoodz: so why not put on your input(keydown)="handleKey($event)"and test if its enter pressing(event.keyCode === 13)and I recommend to use lettable operators instead proto. lazarljubenovic: No but when you write something it fires it, then you end what you write with ENTER if you're happy with what you've written. Which in turn clears the input and you can start typing something else again.. 

issue: Why do you have to always subscribe to a http request? otherwise it won't send i don't get it 
solution: CarlosAmaral: It is not an error, you have to subscribe to it. You could do Take(1) then you don't have to unsubscribe. timothyblue: no, i mean, the http request throws an error when subscribing and i want to suppress that. 

issue: istiti: how big is your project? 
solution: That's not a quantitative value. 

issue: why are you chaning it if you dont want to change it? also map is not for logging, that will return undefined 
solution: 

issue: @Ross-Rawlinsalways start lazy :) i'm using ngx-pipes... but didn't look at the differences, just prefer avoiding the '2' part in the names 
solution: Ross-Rawlins:  [<-LINK->] ... it might even be the same one, just renamed.... they look alike :). jorrit-wehelp: it is the same but I have to group by date/month/year stuff so I have to go custome. 

issue: what about typescript ? for Bazel ;) 
solution: ekarlso: there are Basel rules for using ts. Toxicable: so you compile ts > js > closure filter the js ?. 

issue: is there a way to store say names of my servers in a config file and then retrieve these in code, so if i want to change the names of servers i can just update a config file ? 
solution: hmm so not sure if this is what i am trying to do, so for example say i have two services that i make http requests to. Can i store this in config and then read from that config when making the http request. then when i deploy solution someone can just go into the config and change the ips etc..?. 

issue: if i have a component and inside that component I have a input, how do i expose that input to another component in the same parent component Output: ? 
solution: like im making a breadcrumbs component for a blog, but i want to put a search / filter input in there and use it n a ngFor in another component,. 

issue: anybody know how to use materialize css with angular2,i have tried it manytimes but it dosnt work 
solution: alberthoekstra: From doc: The CombineLatest operator behaves in a similar way to Zip, but while Zip emits items only when each of the zipped source Observables have emitted a previously unzipped item, CombineLatest emits an item whenever any of the source Observables emits an item (so long as each of the source Observables has emitted at least one item). When any of the source Observables emits an item, CombineLatest combines the most recently emitted items from each of the other source Observables, using a function you provide, and emits the return value from that function.. 

issue: Good day everybody:Q: I have a route resolver that has to wait till an boolean gets true. Any guidance or example? 
solution: dklmuc: from a service... lets say just a simple dataIsLoaded:boolean=false  the resolver has to wait untill dataIsLoaded becomes true. @dklmuc yeah but how do I let the resolver wait until the boolean is true: [<-CODE->] all the examples are with a timer or a http request .... 

issue: Transclusion is not destroyed when my dialog is closed ? [<-CODE->] weird 
solution: 

issue: why would we want incremental closure compiler ? isn't it just for prod bundle 
solution: Then you build a graph of symbol-level dependencies, and each incremental change produces an incremental update to that graph.. alxhub: comeon then lets see you build a incremental analysis engine. Toxicable: I've started designing it, actually. But my free time is pretty finite ;). 

issue: What is this NGRX.... it's like magic..... 
solution: 

issue: How can I programmatically set the templateRef of a ngTemplateOutlet ? 
solution: jbeckton: don't use ngTemplateOutlet if you want to do it programatically. you need to remove the view created with the old template and create a new view the new template. 

issue: pmdluca: Do you still need help? 
solution: timothyblue: I made that in my solution before but this situation let me thinking about handle that kind of errors that appears only when you test or use the application and probably will come to the user eventually. I think it was a common situation but nobody seems to handle this situation. Thanks for your response.. 

issue: i just neeed to know how to use materialize in angular i am trying to use datepicker in angular2 but its throwing error in library itself 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] 
solution: kripper10: THat filter has it wide open, you may not want to use it in production. 

issue: I'm hoping someone can clear up for me, with angular 5/the new rxjs package, how do we import operators now? 
solution: rohitsodhia: instead of.filter().map()now.pipe(filter(), map()). SaturnTeam: I can never remember which functions are piped... and you don't import them asimport 'rxjs/add/operator/catch';anymore, right? there's another format?. 

issue: Say you had to make 3 http calls sequentially, would you usemergeMap? 
solution: 

issue: Or even better mergemap (apicall).mergemap(apicall).mergemap(apicall) 
solution: merge, concat, switch allows you to control concurrency of inner observables. So you can have a single stream of URLs or things and then tell Rx how you want it to concurrency handle those. For example you might want to make 2 HTTP calls concurrently and it's easy to do. 

issue: why downgrade? 
solution: 

issue: is there a way to rerender a child component completly? 
solution: i can't downgrade. i  unistall it. and reinstall. 

issue: why not use the offical docs? 
solution: Because i am building custom Theme color changer and i made service for that. All works excepnt chaning colors on hovers and also things such as scrollbar color since they are defined in scss itself. 

issue: hello , i have a problem related to chart.js can some body help me ? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I'm new to angular. How do I prevent old browsers from waiting endlessly to load heavy angular pages? 
solution: Toxicable: it can be on slow networks plus android devices running 4.4 can't load angular pages with their default browser. I s there a way to just notify them that their browsers are incompatible?. 

issue: why's HMR not on by default? or at least under a cli flag?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: becasue it dosen't work well. 

issue: anyone got good reads on medium for angular? 
solution: for now :). 

issue: abhijeet1995: This is pretty good read: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: what does this mean this.episodes=[...episodesCopy,this.otherEpisodes.pop()]; 
solution: faceturn2016_twitter: it means All inside episodesCopy. faceturn2016_twitter: the three dots mean all inside an array. check this link [<-LINK->]. faceturn2016_twitter: remember when you use .pop() it return the last element in array and delete it. It means, this.episodes will containt all in episodes and the lasr element of episodesCopy. 

issue: Are getters and setters meant to work from a Service? 
solution: getters and setters are just functions with a little bit of sugar. Toxicable: Because otherwise I need to type those 2 lines each time? - Or are you saying I should rename them togetPlatformandsetPlatform?. 

issue: i think you can access it via selector no? 
solution: Apart from that obviously. Isnt the whole point of Services to share data across other Services and Components?. abhijeet1995: you can display the corresponding selectors by using ngIf directive. You can set the ngIfs to true or false depending on the menu items clicked. 

issue: depends your keyboard 
solution: ghetolay: your fault for not using US layout for coding. better them than you. you would go around killing people for not optimizing one line of code. 

issue: i see that the guys here have an advanced knowledge of Angular  does  any one have any recommendations besides the documentaions and the basic courses etc , i really want to attend your skills level ^^ 
solution: 

issue: anyone can tell me please how to solve this error? [<-CODE->] 
solution: AmalHanif: You are trying to assign an object to a string. Avoid that.. broweratcognitecdotcom: can you explain for me in details please ? is the solution you're proposing is for intercepting all the http requests so that any request will trigger a function in a loading service that will show our spinner ?. 

issue: Is there a chat for angular.io (4) as well? 
solution: there is no Angular 2. 

issue: guys, do you make a*.module.tsfile for each of your components or it is just me?  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] 
solution: artuska: It is a good idea to do so. Then your various apps that share some of those components don't get bloated with all the other components stuffed into one module.. 

issue: Any idea what can cause the ngSubmit to fire 2 events ? 
solution: rannaot: once upon a time I had a forms (submit) event and (click) event on the submit button bound to the same function which caused it to fire twice. 

issue: How is it possible to detect orientation on a mobile device? 
solution: Ooo !! That's right. jasper22: usage:. 

issue: what did you struggle with when doing an array sort? 
solution: i didnt use arraysort function. it's not ideal, but its recognised as a string, so works with dot notation, and is recognisable as 1.2.1. 

issue: solve it? 
solution: 

issue: is it normal that components of a lazily loaded module appear in the main bundle (doing a prod build with angular cli)? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] any, erm... comments about this? :) 
solution: hmm you mean@bobrosoftjust.finally(() => logout()).subscribe(). or take(1) used or similar. 

issue: yo anyone have a suggestion for uploading and parsing a table in excel? 
solution: two parts to that problem. parsing XLS into something browser friendly, and rendering the the data as an html table. 

issue: I'm thinking about building a game with BabylonJS, would it make sense to use angular framework? 
solution: wachpwnski: I mean you could use it, but angular is pretty heavy and I'd think you would be fine making your own ingame menus and logic within babylon. Especially since youd be doing most of it already. 

issue: what's the correct way to move dev dep to just dep? 
solution: 

issue: guys in angular reactive forms how can i check which validation failed from validators to show the correct message? 
solution: Yeah, I wouldn't expect it to work in production builds at all. You can't run code to generate metadata.. 

issue: *ngIf="localVariable; else elseTemplate"doesn\'t seem to re-evaluate if localVariable changes... is that one of those "well, duh, of course" kinds of behaviors? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] And component code is: [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: any seperate channel for help/issues? 
solution: 

issue: Why ngModel cannot be used with formgroup and reactive forms? 
solution: It's not the correct way. You should put the empty path redirect at theendof the routes list to use it as a fallback.. 

issue: is it always recommended to use pathMatch: "full" when dealing with empty route paths? 
solution: 

issue: :O 
solution: 

issue: was reading this article [<-LINK->] its strongly suggests that we should useforRootby default is this the right startegy? strategy* 
solution: vivekimsit: Yes. That is a very good series of articles.. You should write this method from the start. Call forRoot() when importing into your app. Don't call forRoot in shared modules.. 

issue: Probably need to include Forms Module And it is *ngIf 
solution: ghetolay: That is what I thought which is why I was confused by 'they already have BrowserModule otherwise their app owuldn't work'. Because if they do then they have commonModule and then they have *ngIf. 

issue: How’s everyone today? 
solution: Aww I saw your talk today from angular connect@alxhubit was really helpful. I used to use ngClass and ngStyle but I like [class.foo] just easier to understand. 

issue: bah, hate being stuck on my front end work not because i can't figure out angular but because css is being css-y 
solution: 

issue: I recently reevaluated the top UI libraries, glad I stuck with Angular 
solution: Well every library is so fragmented. That’s why I love Angular so much. I can build virtually anything out of the box with the available API. I don't have to go hunting for a router, http client, or develop my own.. I recently got some flak on Twitter for having a critique of React. To each thier own man. React engineers seem to love how open ended the library is.. 

issue: what does exportAs do 
solution: gho5thunter: ... publishes a reference to the directive instance. so any template references on the component will see the directive instead of the ElementRef?. 

issue: Any issues withangular/cli@latest? 
solution: I've got an incredible idea for a mobile app. But other than web, and xamarin, I'm clueless. 

issue: formdata sends empty file {body: {submoduleid: "9bfc2630-c171-44e5-9838-153d7d70db66", file: {}}} 
solution: 

issue: I can 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: bobrosoft: I want to load  translation file based on user's settings or url param if user is not authenticated, or fallback to default value. Doing it before application starts assures that I don't load file twice. Also, there is no flash of non translated values in my application. 

issue: What's the difference between: [<-CODE->] and [<-CODE->] I ask because the latter is giving me an issue 
solution: for example, right now I'm working with anEventI'm mapping to anumber. If I tried to map it a second time, itd certainly throw an error. 

issue: Is there like a really elegant rxjs solution? Or is that beyond what rxjs can offer? 
solution: syndesis: So how would I setup the pipes so the first request goes before the second? Also, after I make the first request, any subequent requests only needs to fire the second request (the one where I get the actual data). 

issue: I have two  radio buttons. How can i disable one of them using reactive forms?  [<-CODE->] 
solution: alexesca: First of all, when you say disable, do you mean disable the field, or hide/remove it and use a different version of that field? In your first message you have the same formControlName, and I don't think you want to show both at the same time, or do you?. 

issue: o/ 
solution: 

issue: so scope is to tell service worker to not mess with sayadminarea? 
solution: cause this object is a new feature with 5.1. before it was just register it. EreckGordon: i wondered about that too. unfortunately it doesn't seem to work for say disabling sw in /admin, if you want (and probably do) want to use it in the root. 

issue: Juan why do u need that?

issue: What can I use as the equivalent ofdocument.getElementById('hello);` in Angular? 
solution: 

issue: is there a way to add a wrapper on the out most Injector? something like this [<-CODE->] 
solution: SaturnTeam: no, what I need is something like ActivatedRoute from@angular/router but in a higher level.

issue: So that's the solution for it? Lol... ** 
solution: it's becasue of HMR. so it tries to reinitalize the new instance but the old one is like "nope, we already started man". 

issue: you could reference the header component through a template variable and access its properties no need for a service 
solution: 

issue: how to fix this? [<-CODE->] 
solution: Fanaticys: ... it ises2015format. @mlc-mlapis... it is es2015 formatBut how to fix this?. Fanaticys: ... normally by transpiling toes5. thnks. 

issue: morning guys, how can i upperCase the first letter of a word? 
solution: 

issue: has anyone tried to do a multi-part form with both files and a json body with HttpClient? I'm realizing that my building an API that uses JSON bodies may have a drawback... 
solution: I've been poking around, but unless ive missed something big, i havent really cracked it :/ i can always go for two requests, one for data, one for files, but was curious about a multi-part. 

issue: is there any way of further optimizing the code generated from ng build ? 
solution: 

issue: Well at end of 2019 there will be most likely Angular v15 
solution: then after v5 from Angular there will be Vergular or Newgular. the only real versioning i accept is the way TeX is versioned. Since version 3, TeX has used an idiosyncratic version numbering system, where updates have been indicated by adding an extra digit at the end of the decimal, so that the version number asymptotically approaches π. This is a reflection of the fact that TeX is now very stable, and only minor updates are anticipated. The current version of TeX is 3.14159265. 

issue: Anyone using nx workspaces yet? 
solution: 

issue: httpparams are immutable? 
solution: but it's ugly to have to do it directly in the options... append.append.append etc.. 

issue: This will also require setting up your apache to serve stuff on different domains 
solution: mehmetmert: You can google how to setup an apache config; that's not a topic for this channel, and a far more indepth topic that you can get answers to online quickly... ill be glad to answer specific questions, but I don't have time to teach you how to use Apache.. If you're going to do your own work with PHP, I recommend you learn how to work in Apache or NGINX at your earliest convenience. Since you're using XAMPP, Apache is the clear choice.. 

issue: angular.io is down? 
solution: with 3w. Toxicable: you never sleep. You answer every hour! haha. 

issue: Have you checked your router module? 
solution: lucifer7894: you need to configure your server to serve up your index.html by default. 

issue: Can you manually force to load a lazy loaded module? 
solution: Toxicable: Without a preload strategy I want to load a module manually if it isn't loaded yet.. 

issue: what library or service are you using for push notifcations? 
solution: yes that would be one scenario. then i'd use the Angular SW. 

issue: you mean for request, get, post etc... functions ? 
solution: there is a lot of overload signatures. ghetolay: right, I get that. I mean a type definition though. Http used to haveRequestOptsArgsor something like that.. that defined the different permutations that could be allowed in an http request.. 

issue: Hi all I have a newbie-question: I hope someone can help :) 
solution: raul-ruiz: hit us!. i think you should read this. it helped me a lothttps://malcoded.com/posts/rxjs-for-angular-devs. 

issue: ohhh i got it ok. but how can i avoid that? 
solution: as far as i know i could do that with a service. and it's not a parent - child component. 

issue: OnPush isn't inherited at all. Lazy loading has nothing to do with it either 
solution: OnPush is the CD Strat for one CD Ref, which has no concept or Lazy or loading. 

issue: ngIf="people$ | async as peopleis the syntax I prefer 
solution: this.receta2 = this.recetaService.getReceta(id);  where receta2 is. 

issue: why i am getting this error ?  [<-CODE->] 
solution: coderishu: I'd look at those spaces. derekkite: i m not getting it. letme check. 

issue: I know if I need to make an API call before the server loads, I can useAPP_INITIALIZER, but if I just want to run regular code, is there is a best place for that? In theapp.componentconstructor? 
solution: funkizer: Yah, except if someone doesnt hit my root route first, that won\'t run :p I actually did make a global resolver service, something that goes off on every route, but that\'s different from "before app loads" :). 

issue: switchMap with a precicate ? filter ? I bet 10 on filter oh damn 
solution: but filter is probably smarter :p. 10 situps? 10 sips of water?. cause as soon as that observable fires a values it'll trigger the takeUntil. 

issue: Did a comparison of the JS bundlers that people are most likely to use with Angular [<-LINK->] 
solution: Toxicable: I have not looked at it yet. I basically just went by whatever they had documented in the production section of the documentation. I suspect they will make several improvements over time. Looks like the initial focus has been bundling speed.. 

issue: Are you putting the validator on the form or on a field? 
solution: which, i managed to make one of by just creating a foreach loop. 

issue: I lol'd, don't get mad at me :( 
solution: 

issue: it's a token used to fine entry components don't use it though, useprovideRoutesinstead 
solution: I mean I don't think there's any reasonable cases for using those though. 

issue: on the first, why dont you simply inject the services instead of resolving them with the injector? 
solution: jotatoledo: This is the second time I fixed it with the "power of staring"  I\'m telling guys, just staring at your monitor works!. 

issue: any idea on how to bind a SafeStyle instance to the template? solved 
solution: 

issue: Help needed anyone there? 
solution: 

issue: what does the empty forRoot() do again? oh 
solution: 

issue: off topic guys, can i ask if publishing a private in npm packages  is free? thanks thanks. 
solution: 

issue: Is Angular different from AngularJS? 
solution: Prakash__GD_twitter: yes Angular Js is pre Angular 2. 

issue: Hi!!Which promise polyfill is used by Angular?? 
solution: I am debugging an issue on IE11, so I wanted to confirm.. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: Want to drown in angular,node and everything JS. :). 

issue: which tests? 
solution: I don't realy need to run all of them (tho I'd like to get them working). 

issue: Is it better to fetch an object (call to a service method) in the constructor or in thengOnInit()method? 
solution: Toxicable: It works now after FormsModule is imported. I noticed the form is picking up the correct method on the component even without any methods (likeonSubmitorsave()declared on the form itself. Is it due tongModel? The method is calledsaveProduct(product: Product)?. 

issue: Is there any implementation in Angular 4 with XSLT available or angular 4 is supporting this ? 
solution: 

issue: How to use variable value from other component 
solution: crebuh: Still related to http, ie: at [<-LINK->] . And Cannot read property 'load' of undefined. So look for where you are calling load() and check if the object to which it belongs is invalid and figure otu why. 

issue: How's angular at handling the ES2017 Map object with regards to ngFor and such 
solution: BellerophonM: it dosen't. Also I really wish they called it Dict because googling Map and javascript is not fun. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: is there something similar to $q in angular 2 where you can set up a multiple calls in an array 
solution: it's an angularjs (1.x) library for queueing up async calls with promises. i'm workin on an ng2 app, but i cannot use observables -_-. 

issue: $q is for promises 
solution: 

issue: so there is no window provider ? 
solution: 

issue: anyone got good reads on medium for angular? 
solution: @seekheart ... there are many really valuable posts.anyone got good reads on medium for angular?. There's also links to previous months as well as other frameworks such as Vue and ReactJS. 

issue: I've had good luck with HMR and Angular 5. 
solution: fathyb: And I've seen that issue when I hadn't imported a module into anNgModule. Like if I wrote a component that wasn't used in the app, I didn't declare it in anNgModuleand Angular would notice it and throw that error.. 

issue: Hey guys,Has anybody encountered issues with animations when using query while having an async pipe?I have a reproduction on stackblitz, in my oppinion I think the animation should work in all the 5 sections I have in my reproduction here: [<-LINK->] Am I doing anything wrong? 
solution: 

issue: does anyone know what actually happened with npm? 
solution: also my RAM is eaten. it should be locked ^^. 

issue: It made it to hn [<-LINK->] :D

solution: achillesimo: yourCompany[]array ofCompanybut i think response is a object. aadii104: in your component youneed to have somthing like```@Input. 

issue: Is a 60s+ build time unheard of for a largish angular 2 project? or is this somewhat expected? 
solution: 

issue: So it's time for a cup of tea? 
solution: Allright. I will try it later/tomorrow then. Thank you for your time!. I will keep hanging around in here, in  case something happens. 

issue: ._. 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: alexluecke: ... I am not using CLI ... sorry but there should be also WATCH mode, isn't it? 
solution: 

issue: lazarljubenovic: could you explain me why it not working on localhost? 
solution: and after adding angular service worker to app i can't install app as standalone on localhost. 

issue: But not for starting timers I guess@rohitsodhia:) forRoot is not something that's used for this@rohitsodhia 
solution: Mostly forRoot includes extra providers which are to be registered in the AppModule, where as forChild won't include them (this is all about DI).. 

issue: are the dates undefined in the data coming in? 
solution: the pickerisopened (when I invoke thetest()method) but always at current date (jan 2018). Can\'t seem to change that from "outside" :(. 

issue: what’s new? 
solution: In general. merlin2049er:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: good morning folks My workplace uses angular we moved from jquery xD 
solution: 

issue: hm... seems like vscode has started autolinking pretty specifically? [<-CODE->] 
solution: hm... i just realized you cant watch for changes with ElementRef... i need to figure out what to do here.... 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] https://gist.github.com/basherr/537ca5459cb02dcaea9a247fe58969f6 
solution: mlc-mlapis: this dosent work i guess i mislead you , what i am looking for is to get the tab event to programatically fire when the user prssed the arrow keys.

issue:  [<-CODE->] why isn't my global angular-cli updating? 
solution: well I dont know about for you, but I've noticed lots of...... weirdness with the net today. 

issue: Hello everyone, I need to know what version of Angular I should choose to learn Angular, Angular 4 o v5? 
solution: 

issue: I used themydatepickerwith Angular -- works well: [<-LINK->] 
solution: I think if you only want a month picker -- you can write your own, bypassing all the messiness that comes with a datepicker.Even a simple dropdown would do well. 

issue: is this good practice to get the data object from your route? [<-LINK->] 
solution: yeah I've jest and it seems a load faster. 

issue: This goes back to what I've been saying for the past 5 years. Too much attention spent on micro-optimizing JS code when we should working on curing cancer. except we don't know how and it doesn't pay 
solution: on a podcast I recently listened to this guy was mentioning how everyone is getting alarmed by the fires in California and he was like "what would happen if everyone just dropped what they were doing and went to help put out the fires". 

issue: are you rolling itup? 
solution: Like <?> or something like this, I'll check it again. 

issue: sooothem object assignments, right!? 
solution: part of the compilation process. which includes compilers. 

issue: does.donot turn an observablehot? 
solution: awwwww efffff. only subscribe does. 

issue: hello. Can a route be lazy loaded from a lazy loaded route? 
solution: mlc-mlapis: perfect, before I go down the rabbit hole of my error I just wanted to make sure it was possible. 

issue: is there any way to have a component wait for a subscription before running anything else? 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys, would be really grateful if someone can have a look at this [<-LINK->] 
solution: arbghl: that seems unlikely - it's impossible to make a synchronous XHR withHttpClient.. 

issue: anyone run unit tests with jest here? 
solution: I messed with it with an old project and it def seemed like it was more... stable... and seemed faster. ronnyek: ... yep, it seems to be 35 % faster, there are some problems with@types... you have to specify them explicitly to avoid collisions with Jasmine. 

issue: so what's the overhead of a module on top of a component? :P 
solution: I guess apart from all the import references right?. 

issue: [suiTabHeader]="t.toFixed(0) + 1" but[suiTabHeader]="t + 1"should work 
solution: and i have no clue why adding a number to a number returns string. 

issue:  any suggestions or alternative solutions of how to mock a viewchild that uses a directive selector? 
solution: but the component I am testing will always be trying to match a viewchild with selectorChildDirectiveinstead ofChildDirectiveMockright?. so if I have@ViewChild(ChildDirective) child: ChildDirective;and thenthis.child.doSomething()I will getthis.childis undefined. 

issue: So you're talking about angular elements 
solution: I started to watch some screen cast with big justin. 

issue: Reactive stuff is on the agenda post v6 New view engine opens up a ton of possibilities 
solution: Not public. You can poke around some of the newest code in the repo to get an idea. CORT0619: that’s usually related to you subscribing to an observable that ain’t, or returning something from flat/switchMap that isn’t observable. 

issue: what? 
solution: 

issue: Hi all! I used angular 4, Is there  any chart feature is available in angular 4 or 5? 
solution: 

issue: Can someone PLEASE help me with this issue? [<-LINK->] Error: Can't resolve all parameters for AppComponent: (?). 
solution: Toxicable: That fixed my plnkr but i checked the name in my local and it isn't working :(. 

issue: anyone knows why I have unexpected token export in this plnkr ? [<-LINK->] 
solution: is there any reason to prefer using "children" for subroutes rather than defining the route as something like: [<-CODE->]. 

issue: @dklmuc  Hi, a few weeks ago we talked about a solution for route resolve not for an http observable... You came with a solution I implemented and its working [<-CODE->] but there is nowhere an unsubscribe so I end up with a lot of subscriptions... Any idea?the resolver is on a child route /module.. and the module get loaded a lot.. 
solution: My biggest with Angular since day one (2 years ago...) is timing.  On any combination Iam trying to develop it always ends up that async data is not loaded before component or module get started, because components/modules are mostly independent (can be reused) they need to be initialised or configured by async data.... 

issue: how about official documentation [<-LINK->] ?? Did you read the documentation? 
solution: applied ngStyle and ngClass. 

issue: was 5.2.0 removed from npm?

issue: How do I get the contents of my current component? [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]

issue: Child components don\'t init before the parent has so that wouldn\'t do much. By "loaded" do you mean after you loaded some data?  :) 
solution: funkizer: butRespond after Angular initializes the component's views and child views., so it should be called after init of child 1. jupereira0920:  Then yeah, forget AfterViewInit, set something like areadyproperty to true when you\'re ready to show children, and a *ngIf="ready" on the children. Or an even better pattern:. 

issue: too bad, aot still unusable in dev mode in 1.7.0 
solution: fxck: yup, it's known that it dosen't scale. 

issue: maybe someday cli will use closure and all our bundles will be 53kb?  :) 
solution: maybe someday the cli will use bazel and our builds will be <2s *. it's still very much a distant dream right now, bazel dosen't even have a pipeline for code splitting right now. 

issue: evolution is a sine wave, eh? 
solution: with the exception of actually being standard bytecode implementation. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] I am also pretty sure you can't get a 404 status in a success callback you could get that status in the error handler 
solution: I am also pretty sure you can't get a 404 status in a success callback. 

issue: Question: is there a way to hideng-versionfrom the DOM elementbody? 
solution: Toxicable: If I understand trackBy and OnPush properly, both are about DOM updates optimization - after initial rendering. My current performance issue is about initial rendering. [<-LINK->]. 

issue: I would like to dynamically add a component to the DOM(click on a button), but the angular renders empty tag: [<-LINK->] 
solution: martabrzeszczyk: ... it is not the way you can use .... 

issue: I experience another performance issue(Microsoft Edge, Firefox). There is a delay when I change radiobutton. [<-LINK->] Any idea how to speed it up without limiting number of rendered rows ? 
solution: Toxicable: OnPush does seem to help here.But I do not get one thing. I added the trackBy, but I still do see output in the console(under ngFor) on every radio change.It does not re-render the whole node tho,  then I guess it's fine.. [<-LINK->]. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] what is this?

solution: 

issue: Hello there...anybody can help me with angular material autocomplete? 
solution: 

issue: Is the angular universal starter on the universal docs page still the best example with the latest angular version? I have been going through examples and I see some ssr that are using platformserver with state transfer and the universal starter example doesn't have it. It uses a modulemapper import. 
solution: Rohit. I am in the process of setting my app up to do ssr using universal but I just finished getting material2 working. I used a common material module to inject all the material components. It may help you [<-LINK->].

issue: Hi everyone...I have an issue with Angular 5.X when using Observables from service to component...And I would like to know if someone could help me to figure out the issue and solution.. 
solution: Here is my context: I have a Component (Let\'s call it CA) that creates many Components (CB).Each component CB calls the same function from a service class.This function creates and returns an Observable.In the callback function of this Observable (let\'s call it O1), it subscribes to another Observable (O2), which is a member of the service classObservable O2 push data to observers as long as it receives data from WebSocket connection.In Observable O1, when it receives data from O2, it push this data to its observers.My issue here, is that my components CB (which, as I said before, are subscribed to this Observable (O1) don\'t receive my data sent by O1.When debugging O1 callback code, I can break on line when O1 receives data from O2. And then, it does an "observer.next(dataReceivedFromO2)".But subscribers (1 in each Component C2) don\'t receive any data and I don\'t understand why..

solution: I am not exactly sure what you are meaning. i return the state of the promise i think. Thethis.userSis for authorization of the user and it es just a function with returning true or false. 

issue: Anyone know if in a reactive form, control generation is async? 
solution: Toxicable: bah, i was hoping that was the problem. i dont get what's going on then!. and filter isn't even working because of this async.... but creating a control is just instantiating a class. 

issue: guys any good CMS for MEAN stack?? 
solution: 

issue: why i am getting this errro Can\'t bind to \'items\' since it isn\'t a known property of \'ListView\'. ("  [<-CODE->] 
solution: because you ask questions everyday that an be answered by going through it carefully and reading it instead of copy-pasting. 

issue: anyone want to help me instead of watching this go off the rails? 
solution: I want to do things in a clean/right way.. and I'm a newb w/ Angular and CLI (old hat at AngularJS and webpack stuff). 

issue: hello all, [<-CODE->] by doing this I am getting input field as empty on submitting ?is there any other way to  fill the value? 
solution: rdtomar: that's not how you bind a value, nor how you do it in reactive forms. 

issue: hmmm, not that many new things in this release 
solution: All I really want to do is adjust the input as its typed and always set the keyboard type to tel. 

issue: there’s a solution to build a table with component?

solution: ghetolay: Any link please ?. 

issue: is there a way to get the value out of a replay subject directly, eg, not subscribe? im in the same service as the subject, and dont need to worry about a next 
solution: rohitsodhia: subscribe needs to happen, but if a consumer is subscribing you can use an operator .map or tap etc.. rohitsodhia: no... you usually don't know when the value is available, so would need to check/poll/wait... so that's what subscribe is for (e.g. a behaviorsubject has an inital value, and does have a getValue() method). Also, if you don't care about next, just do a .take(1). jorrit-wehelp: I knew there was a getValue on behavior, i wasn't sure if replay had anything similar. So I guess time to do a bunch of maps and switches :p. 

issue: I think you need to configure the router to do that. 
solution: alxhub: I am trying to use [<-LINK->] with angular router. 

issue: this [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] how can I fix it? 
solution: I know it can be wrapped into another element but it is a table. 

issue: laters 
solution: now it's freaking out for this reason. that was produced in a clean build environment. I tried to change the bin directory like you said but npm seems even more upset. 

issue: does that fact that what I'm trying to subscribe to is in a nested formgroup matter? does it change the way I should do things? 
solution: git question: in my branch I have 6 commits. I want toreset --softto a prior commit and then recommit all files in just one commit. Is that not possible after you've already pushed to your remote?. 

issue: they should just make it like oracle --max_old_space_size=100% 
solution: mlc-mlapis: alrighty. I did a benchmark and you can totally go over 8gb. Toxicable:. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: casually just going through the angular tutorial... covers a lot of ground. but not great if you wanted something a bit more interactive with an instructor. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] this is useless 
solution: even the one withngZone.run(). 

issue: ... any news on the date of lunch of  FALCON HEAVY? 
solution: other than top fuel dragsters, its the loudest thing i've ever experienced. and also the brightest, which was more surprising than the noise. 

issue: Is there a tool to help show compomoents have have been checked in change detection 
solution: vbabiy: i'd advice not to do that for an existing app unless you're already following onPush friendly patterns like smart&dumb components, async pipe etc. or if the app is small. The performance gain doesn't cover the hours spent on refactoring :P. 

issue: prod build, full build or rebuild? 
solution: well I don't really have a rebuild, so a full. 

issue: What is the advantage of bazel? Build splitting? 
solution:

solution: For now, yeah you cant even use it yet. 

issue: Guys what do you use for back-end? 
solution: skiabox: I use nodejs and express with mysql. So you have one project running or two?. I mean you can run the back-end as a separate project. 

issue: What doesforRoot()do when importing a module?  I can't find help on that 
solution: tommck: It allows you to only load services and register them in the root of the app so you don't end up with multiple services.. tommck: This is a pretty good article. [<-LINK->]. 

issue: are child injectors constructed only for lazy loaded modules? 
solution: Toxicable: , will the services provided by the lazy loaded modules be included in the AppModule's injector?. 

issue: Hi, if i have an input file of type .json, can i get the content? 
solution: @broweratcognitecdotcom yeah i know this, but i have [<-CODE->] and want handle it in the component like [<-CODE->]. Dinodanio: I don't think you have access to a file on your file system in the way you need it. You might have to send it to the server, have the server put it somewhere, then request it back.. 

issue: Is usingInjectorto get services inside components or other services a bad practice? 
solution: marcincichocki: If you are doing it to get around a cyclic reference error then you should probably re-architect your code to fix the issue. IMO. 

issue: how would you integrate a non-angular JS plugin with Angular 5? [<-LINK->] 
solution: @GoNode5 well, https://github.com/rintoj/angular2-virtual-scroll is not really working for me atm...having issue with parentScroll windowI would like to use the body scroll instead of container scroll. 

issue: Does anyone know when a guard is run? Is it whenever the route is targeted? 
solution: NikolaJankovic: irc, guards and resolvers are ran before the navigation happens, so when a user clicks on the route, but before being navigated to the route. hungerregnuh: do you know if it occurs on every navigation to the route or just the once? I'm having an issue where my auth guard is tied to a behaviour subject and I'm not sure if I can use getValue() to just get the current value or if I have to subscribe.. 

issue: 1920 in javascript is what... 2016? 
solution: that's one thing found quickly when starting with angular.. the JS world changes stupid fast.  I'm use to my slower .net world... something new every couple years haha. 

issue: how can i copy as code in chat?

issue: How do I track the scroll of an element? 
solution: But that conflicts with another event I am using. 

issue: I work at Symantec and can say def dont develop with anti virus software actively scanning. 
solution: 

issue: Is this kosher? I just made calling bootstrap a window method. [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Seems too easy. 
solution: It's not for bootstrapping twice - good catch.It's because the angular app is being embedded in a JQuery mess & they don't want it running until a certain tab is selected.. 

issue: anybody is having some good demo of angular lazy loading ? lazy loading of images 
solution: coderishu: while I dont have a demo, would probably handle this with an Injectable that broadcasted scroll events to Directives, the directive would set the src attribute of the img or background css property when it receives an event emitted from the Injectable, then unsubscribe.. 

issue: will that scaffold what it normally tries to scaffold? like e2e and all that 
solution: just in the folder you currently are located. ronnyek: when you use your private libs in node_modules, does CLI put that in the vendor chunk?. 

issue: Hi, any chance anyone is willing to give an overview of the upcoming project Ivy/renderer3? 
solution: Toxicable: cool, thx, in any case, it will be very nice to know if there is any additional info (even if it is in the far future and completely tentative). 

issue: How does it handle TS transforms? 
solution: 

issue: Is this an appropriate place to ask a question about a style attribute being applied to the ng-component tag created by the router? 
solution: nm, can't seem to post an image. I'll post to stackoverflow and throw a link in here in case someone is willing to take a look. 

issue: ANgular is just html, css and js files it's nothing special 
solution: 

issue: this is nice to get input on these problems everyone has to encounter I've asked about it before 
solution: be flexible to allow animations as an option of a shared component. 

issue: what's new? 
solution: 

issue: Hi peeps! Angular fanatic here :D Still need help Denise? 
solution: And probably merge that observable with an Observable.fromEvent on that button.. 

issue: was changing out the cli defaults difficult? 
solution: integration in webstorm is great. so I can just click the little debug icon next to the test name, it launches and starts that test with MAYBE 750ms overhead. 

issue: In the@Componentdecorator, is there any way to bind a value in host:{} to one of the class properties? 
solution: ronnyek: My problem is that the component is being added dynamically, so the only other way I can think of is to try and set it in the class itself. More specifically I'm trying to add a flex layout directive to the containing element of a dynamically generated component.. 

issue: what's new what 
solution: 

issue: They do have a bunch of improvements though, buzzwords aside 
solution: As soon or near after 4 hits final. 

issue: link? 
solution: 

issue: is there really even a project type for nodejs backend? 
solution: seems lik eyou could just drop js and shite in the existing project and run express on it or whatever. 

issue: hmmmm all i can think of is, node upgraded itself? 
solution: i’m guessing that happened, when you run a npm upgrade it creates deps. 

issue: guys do you believe that parcel bundler will take the place of webpack in angular cli builds? 
solution: unlikely. parcel is the second project in popularity right now in github. skiabox: if anything it's more likely that you'll be able to use Bazel with the CLI rather than parcel. 

issue: what's the difference between ng serve and ng serve --prod? what actually changes? 
solution: infogulch:  [<-LINK->] There is some info in there, that you can expand from.. when i runng serve --aotthe loader doesn't work, but it works fine when i runng serve --aot --prod. 

issue: How much of it is solved with SharedArrayBuffer? 
solution: i could see running something like a gql resolver, where you make one request from the main thread and the worker might hit a dozen APIs or storage or w/e. I started thinking about how to get interceptors working, and trying to use providers across the worker boundary started making my head hurt. 

issue: I'm getting some error. But I have no idea where to look for the problem: [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: isn't this deprecated ? 
solution: in webpack4 it will be deprecated in webpack. but the cli dosen't supportimport()anyway. Last line has the problem with System.import. 

issue: Hi@lisacopeland,  You can use the Input () as an EventEmitter in the child component.OnSumit is the component of the main component by the child component 
solution: _onSubmit is a method in the child component bind submit form. Which through@Input() onSubmit  :  EventEmiiter<any> property you can call the original method in the parent component.. 

issue: yea what are workers good for? if it takes a long time to send a little of data to it something light to send, heavy calculations? 
solution: i thought i could make a dashboard more usable by shifting heavy calc to a worker (like 900000 rows of data), turns out it took twice as long all together than to just do it in the main thread x). 

issue: what do you want to ask him?

issue: Hey guys :DI have this in my component: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: npm install 
solution: I thought cli already did that?. :( I never had this problem before. trynpm i uglifyjs-webpack-plugin --save-devthen. 

issue: Angular tutorial step 6 does NOT write that Services need to be imported!!! I had to tell by running generator with --module 
solution: Well it didn't break. It just marked this file as having been edited external to my tool. and thecamel-caselib decided to change to handle that. 

issue: any idea how to run code on "deactivation" phase in router? but no before deactivation like CanDeactivate does also I cannot use ngOnDestroy 
solution: dklmuc: I\'m using ngrx with combination of custom CanActivate "state preloader" which waits until data are loaded to the store. Problem is when same component (MessageListComponent) is used in multiple routes (/messages/upcoming and /messages/sent), but use same ngrx state.. 

issue: as in "without the CLI"? If so, I haven\'t ventured that far 
solution: 

issue: hidden div example? I am not able to implement it 
solution: yarn has gotten a lot faster too. 

issue: does anyone knows how to use@angular/service-workerwithin Webpack build?

issue: steveblue: might know   [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Does anyone know a way of creating a route that always requires re-authentication? 
solution: irbrownie: route guard. [<-LINK->]. so another thing about this, is that anytime you navigate away even after authenticating you have to re-auth.. So, authenticate even after authenticating any time you view this route.. 

issue: Hello, I need some help to handle a refresh token on my application, my question is, how to retry the last request after refresh the token```         (error: any) => {          if (error instanceof HttpErrorResponse && error.status === 401) {            this.attemptToRefreshToken(request);            //          } [<-CODE->] ```

I\'m getting this error:REQUEST FOR DOCUMENT FAILED.\nWe are unable to retrieve the "guide/reactive-forms" page at this time. Please check your connection and try again later.. 

issue: I have problem with API docs oh Ihad fine now 
solution: it's where I'am (a bit..) afraid of, that pwa will give this kind of problems?. i could do the conversion on my onSubmit and on the form initilize but that is not so nice..

issue: ghetolay: @allis there any best image editor for  angular apps , actually i need to upload an image and after that need to edit it.. 
solution: lazarljubenovic: but my image ll basically be dynamic so i ll be using an image uploader and after that just want to mark a few areas using the editor, so is canvas good one to go??. or you can handle mouse clicks and position small html elements at the clicked positions and save that data seperately from the imagewhich I highly recommend. 

issue: anyone implement websockets in an angular app? curious what if any gotcha’s there are 
solution: Hmmmm Socket.io is supposedly the slowest of the socket libraries. But it has good documentation.. 

issue: seems like every day the same questions

issue: sample_twitter: What don't you understand about [<-LINK->] ? 
solution: Toxicable: Take a look at it, it doesn't bind to the group object when divided into reusable subcomponents that contain inputs. Toxicable: So in any case like this, we have to just use a lot of input change boilerplate to update the values of the parent groups huh?  I suppose that makes sense that the formThingName directives would no longer have their convenient context-finding abilities. 

issue: what's the point in a Promise here ^ ? 
solution: 

issue: Angular Bootstrap Material Design is a library I found to be a wonderful alternative to AngularMaterial 
solution: It's fairly established. I would think most of their downloads would come from their website, but I'm not entirely sure. 

issue: what IDE do you use? 
solution: 

issue: what is the best IDE to make a small app in angular? 
solution: jjoaoclaro: WebStorm (The "front end developer" version of JetBrain\'s IDE) is a much more "fully featured" IDE.  I was just kidding around, tho... use what works best for you.  Personally I haven\'t tried VSCode since, like, a year or so ago... so whatever features it has now I\'m entirely unaware of..

solution: 

issue: "Tour of Heroes" provides good examples of how the app root works. 
solution: As part of learning Angular, I actually try to refrain from using Google. It is opposite of what we are often taught that Google is our friend, but often you will find that if you reread parts of the official documentation, the answer is right in front of you.. 

issue: how to install latest angular-cli beta ? 
solution: was there anything we were supposed to do upon installing node about setting up npm global paths or anything?. 

issue: OnClick of button, I am getting an object. can I store the values of object in one array? 
solution: I agree. An app might have a use case where one must deviate from conventions. However, I attempt to make due with conventions where possible, if my app's requirements will fit into established conventions. Of course, this is coming from a college graduate.. 

issue: is your subscription in ngOnInit, and does your test actually call that? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, is it possible to assign a formControl to  *ngIf? 
solution: well, you'll want to actually get it's value, not if the form control exists, but yah. 

issue: so, let me get this straight. If you make the parameter of the constructor public then it’ll be available in the class without having to define it in the class and do this.foo = foo? 
solution: 

issue: Shouldn’t this work?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: I need to make an API call when my app first loads to determine which page to send them to. Although even canActivateChild doesn’t make the guard run unless I go directly to a child route. 

issue: That’s how we have ~300 Protractor scenarios written by testers who don’t know JS 
solution: that sentence still dosen't make sense :P. However I don't have any websites for my personal stuff at the moment so nothign to try it on. 

issue: hmmm, not sure i like that module, what if there's only standiNG room? 
solution: 

issue: it doesnt? doesnt it have a snapshot object on it you can determine if its active if the url/params match, no? 
solution: I\'ve always wanted to be able to "configure" a component via tags, so not content projection. fugwenna: If it does I cant seem to find it. All the snapshots i can seem to find only show the primary outlet not the secondary. 

issue: are you inside an angular-cli project? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. akashbanginwar: have you tried creating a new project?. still i am facing the same issue    you have to be inside an angular-cli project in order to use the generate command.. 

issue: what are some fun angular questions to ask candidates? 
solution: mlc-mlapis: I honestly honestly believe most peopple here doing angular dont know a lot about onpush. 

issue: Hi everyone. I am looking for some recommendations for creating backend api's for my angular projects. Something ligt but quick to work with. 
solution: 

issue: Do we have any thing similar toattr()in Angular 5 which can be used to add attribute dynamically to my component HTMLFor Ex: [<-CODE->] 
solution: divyameher: ... first of all ... I recommend to use reactive based forms only ... don't mix them with template based forms. And you can useControlValueAccessorinterface for more advanced cases.. 

issue: Has anybody faced with animation issues in angular 5 on IE11? 
solution: 

issue: +1 
solution: 

issue: await waits for the response and triggers the change detection? 
solution: you might have been able to move your original stuff to just afterViewInit. 

issue: Whats the best way to conditionally add params from my localStorage if they are notnull?@funkizer 
solution: <-- is fine :) or you could do all the checking first and then chain all the set calls like params=params.set().set(isNull? {} : {a:b}). 

issue: I think I'm in love with Lerna 
solution: 

issue: ... it was really impressive, bravoFalcon Heavy! 
solution: I loved the Space Shuttle, but this was pretty awesome too haha. bradtaniguchi: this feels more like Pi in the Sky .... 

issue: you can do some stuff with a webpack alias 
solution: or paths in your tsconfig. yeah realized immediately after reading your thing. 

issue: No, that's@Toxicable. :P 
solution: but he works for a space company. 

issue: Hi guys. Is there any way to specifydeployUrldynamically in a runtime? 
solution: SaturnTeam: the thing is, that I don't know what shall I change to make Angular sending requests tocustom_injected_public_url/assets.I know, that I can inject something likeAPP_INITIALIZERor the other token for aAPP_CONFIG, but I don't know where to put this URL to get working as--deployUrlparameter does.Mainly needed to make LazyLoad working on an environment, where public assets folder can have a new path each page load. 

issue: well basically I have to re-write every place theres a heirarchywhy introduce the hierarchy at all? 
solution: i mean in the selector. why not just do<ul my-thing>and be done with it?. doesnt that mean I need to still do <ul my-thing>. 

issue: oh yeah, we use host{} quite a bit 
solution: 

issue: Doesn't angular protect from script injection out of the box? 
solution: gvonhagel: JWTs were specifically designed to avoid using cookies for auth.. 

issue: so... async and observables arn't cool mh? 
solution: with observables, you don'tawait, youreactto iteach timeit happens. 

issue: o.O 
solution: 

issue: and who wins in hand-to-hand combat, the UX designer or the security auditor... 
solution: more or less.. Actually to be more specific I want to have a left sidebar.. which would change dynamically based on the user interaction.... and of course the content as well.... 

issue: is there an alternate way to do this or best practice 
solution: 

issue: hey@Toxicableyou using firestore in your firebase project? got a question about usingseton documents 
solution: i was doing it through angularfire2 btw (didn’t see any issues around set not working in github so i assumed i just screwd my code up bad). 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: lazarljubenovic: if you plan on getting snarky. Provide an example how to handle this instead of RTFM. Everyone makes mistakes when they are starting and RxJS isn't so easy and the documentation is. 

issue: what is ng-deep replaced with? 
solution: it replaced /deep/ which was also deprecated. 

issue: Hello all!Is it possible to get the DOCUMENT in angular universal at the time of loading the scripts? 
solution: 

issue: what does angular have to do with bricks? 
solution: 

issue: As far as I can tell, you can't. Unless you eject the project and modify webpack config@avifatal 
solution: you can do that manually though.. Add another script in package.json withtsccommand that points to some folder that will contain standalone scrips. avifatal: you can take the project out of cli context. That's calledeject. You can do that byng ejectin your folder.. 

issue: hey guys... is thiswrong?  I'm not asking if its against convention, just if this iswrong:-) [<-CODE->] and if it isn't wrong, then how do I navigate programatically to the child route?this._router.navigate(['/users/', user.userId]);isn't working...  as didn't['./',  user.userId]iirc 
solution: Question: is this an Angular bug?I have a guard on auth pages (login / register / forgot password) https://paste2.org/aaHX4KKj1) If the user is logged in, it should not be able to open /app/auth/signin for instance..2) when F5'ing on this url... it routes to /app ....3) but my app routing says [<-CODE->] 4) but its not redirecting to /rides ... you are stranded on the app component, without loading children. 

issue: hi@dolanmiuhave you done any electron related plugin? 
solution: adibro500: essentially i exposed the webpack config angular cli is using under the hood, and then modifying it to create electron apps. 

issue: my routes are modules linking to other modules... :-( 
solution: robwormald: there is  still a major gap between what developers need and the current Angular state. With no official roadmap (besides unpresentable milistones inside github) we have no idea where this going to... Labs don't help either.. 

issue: Is there a design doc for Ivy? 
solution: angularjs, for all of its foibles, was extremely flexible. that meant people built some dumb stuff, but people built someincrediblestuff too. i was just yesterday talking how, if i could build a framework, it would be angular but (more) extensible :). 

issue: If an observable is being async piped in a template inside of an ngIf will the component still consider it subscribed? 
solution: I would assume since exports$ is being async piped that it would run this  when the component is initialized.. 

issue:  me 
solution: 

issue: what is thisvarrubbish :P 
solution: 

issue: Doesn\'t rxjs have a "toArray()" operator? Would that work in your case? 
solution: I think that's the doc for it. 

issue: thats what she said :D 
solution: Toxicable: I haven't looked into them, what sorta benefits would I get from using/looking into them?. unless you want something like a specific template for your component generation. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] why we need it? 
solution: vivekimsit: if you want to have a collection of templated files. 

issue: anyone know how to provide a custom lazy load stategy to router? 
solution: Toxicable: Its a long story. I cannot use webpack because how long it takes for it to build my project during development, thats why Im using systemjs for development and webpack for production. More I work with systemjs more problems I have, and I decided to try alternative to both of them - parcel. However first thing I got broken with parcel is how lazily modules are loaded - they are loaded using System.import (from what I see in angular code, not sure how it works then in webpack). So, first what come in mind is to provide a custom strategy to replaceSystem.importto justimport, what parcel supports. But I still hope if there are some simplified solutions.. 

issue: Can you pass a function as an@Input 
solution: Matmo10: you have to bind it probably. input="myFnOnCmpInstance.bind(this)". angulario. 

issue: what does this line of code dothis.rows = [...this.rows]; 
solution: jjoaoclaro: ...[...anyArray]leads to an array and{...any}leads to an object. and that line basically creates a copy of rows. smart table uses virtual scrolling?. 

issue: Hello All,I am getting "Can\'t resolve all parameters for PlaceholderPage: ([object Object], [object Object], ?)." while injecting service using constructor injection here is code: Placeholder.ts@IonicPage()@Component({  selector: 'page-placeholder',  templateUrl: 'placeholder.html',})export class PlaceholderPage {constructor(public navCtrl: NavController, public navParams: NavParams,public navProxy:NavProxyService) {  }ionViewDidLoad() {    console.log('ionViewDidLoad PlaceholderPage');  }} @NgModule({  declarations: [    MyApp,    ItemPage,    PlaceholderPage  ],  imports: [    BrowserModule,    LoginPageModule,    HomePageModule,    UserprofilePageModule,    HttpClientModule,    IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp),    TranslateModule.forRoot({      loader: {        provide: TranslateLoader,        useFactory: (createTranslateLoader),        deps: [HttpClient]      }    })],  bootstrap: [IonicApp],  entryComponents: [    MyApp,    HomePage,    LoginPage,    UserprofilePage,    ItemPage,    ItemsPage,    PlaceholderPage],  providers: [    StatusBar,    SplashScreen,    HcService,    NavProxyService,    CollectFailedRequestService,    {provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: AuthInterceptor, multi: true},    {provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: IonicErrorHandler},    WidgetUtils  ]}) yes, I have resigtered it on the app.module.ts in provider section 
solution: 

issue: Is there anything wrong for using HostListener to bind to an output from a directive applied to the component like so: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] It works, but I don't want to depend on it if it's not meant to 
solution: I have a component ActionOutlet (list of buttons and an output for clicks on each item) which is customized by a directive that extends from ActionProvider which has an output "actionStates", which the ActionOutlet listens to to update the list. This is so I can put the logic for the action states in the directive rather than passing it to the action outlet from the consuming component.. 

issue: a selector is nice for testing too,$('selector')in protractor 
solution: 

issue: pro advice 
solution: I mean really, those two things is about all that trips up people on Universal in one way or another. 

issue: What is ivy? - [<-LINK->] 
solution: nirving: this is my favorite graph - this is when someone on our team actually merged a broken version of angularjs into google's codebase:. that'sallbuilds across google - gives you some idea of how much stuff depends on angular. 

issue: I need to be able to be able to select the first option if the value, ie. what I am binding to with ngModel, is not in the list. [<-CODE->] 
solution: No, I mean, if the property of the component that I am binding to with ngModel , in this case 'value' as in above, and value is not one of the options then I want the first option to be selected.. 

issue: Does anyone know any drawback to not return any value when using a guard likecanActivate? 
solution: 

issue: I don't see what JSON has to do with HOC's you don't take a component as input anywhere 
solution: splincode: Dynamic is a bit of an overloaded term. Just forget about HOC. You might not need them and if you do, they are coming soon anyways.. 

issue: jplew: ... try to do it beforesubscribe... like: [<-CODE->] 
solution: that doesn't seem to catch it.@mlc-mlapis. 

issue: can u make an example what is 'more signature' here? 
solution: 

issue: Hmm wierd. It should work withconcatMapand a flat function call  since it will emit a new observable. Is this an async pipe bug? Does a subscribe emit the data as expected? [<-CODE->] 
solution: It appears that usingbufferTime"works" in the sense that I get values now - but it\'s all of them, not split up into groups as I wanted :|. 

issue: ? ???? 
solution: 

issue: o/ 
solution: 

issue: If I subscribe to an Observable that has been pipedtake(1), do I need to unsubscribe? 
solution: unless you know for sure it's gonna be sync and always be. unless you know for sure it's gonna be sync and always beWhat does this mean?. sarunint: that the value is emitted synchronously like when using a BehaviourSubject. 

issue: does anyone use Angular + Cordova? 
solution: 

issue: so this is just to do it here instead of in a base http class thingy? 
solution: Toxicable: I have it. it's dup of something I already have. 

issue: Guys is normal that aot copy the used module fromnode_modules? 
solution: 

issue: any webstorm users here? 
solution: vim or bust. I’m a webstorm user. 

issue: any recommendation to learn Javascript? we use it a lot in our project 
solution: There are lots of books. ydkjsbook series. I started You dont know js. 

issue: ./node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng->./node_modules/.bin/ng 
solution: EreckGordon: your suggesting to chaing thescirptswont work as anynpm run ...followingnode--node-flagwont be executed. yeah i c that here [<-LINK->] but have a feeling that it might wont work on windows as actually didnt trysayingError: Cannot find module 'c:\\Projects\\Other\\proj\\'which'. 

issue: Homies How is everyone 
solution: 

issue: Mean563: you could usewindow.localStorageorwindow.sessionSotrageif you don't want to save the state for a long time.See this: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Is there a way to find out what modules aren't used in an ngModule to do some clean up ? I@msonawanecheck rxdb I only played with it but it seemed cool [<-LINK->] Yeah well, it\'s that or something that is less "reactive" PouchDB, but then you might end up with something like rxdb And how did you find dexie ? Did it work well with angular ? In my case I neede 
solution: I guess it depends what you want anyway I needed something where I can subscribe to a place in db and then being able to subscribe to changes (which rxdb provides). A bit like ngrx store but indexdb under the hood for offline app.  We didn't go through it but we might in the future. 

issue: Are you addicted? :P 
solution: Alex spamming it is so fun lol. and a subject emitting objects with a property id. 

issue: what is universal ? 
solution: 

issue: What if there is a nuke ? 
solution: it looks like a secret weapon. it's like this caption isbeeeeeees. It means "fucking cats", formally. 

issue: anyone here use stripe 
solution: has a generic type constraint on it. 

issue: Morning all 
solution: I looked and it's almost 6am in NZ. I was about to say I didn't expect the time to be so close, then I realized it'sThursdaythere.. 

issue: i have created a object 
solution: robertbrower-technologies: barrels are just big ol\' files that export all your individual files into a "namespace" of sorts. robertbrower-technologies: this is the first milestone [<-ISSUE->]. 

issue: Hi I have a question about arrays I have this kind of array : Array = {Details: Object, praticienDetails: Object} Yes 
solution: 

issue: instead of subscribing, turn it into a promise? feels filthy suggesting, but i think it is ok in testing .toPromise() 
solution: Toxicable: submitted a pr for logging service and was told that wasnt desired currently (something about the potential to bog stuff down too much), so just roll your own for now. EreckGordon: yeah, was just looking at that thread.. was surprised we hadn't moved forward from that yet. 

issue: Is there a way to have a child route look at the / before it and match to a component like that? EX:a/b/c [<-CODE->] a would be the parent route ^ above doesnt work but anyone know how to do this? 
solution: hmmmm I dont think so in that example pretend item is dynamic and wanted to load different components based on that so its like a child looking to the left one to know what to load. yeah, i don't really understand you. in my example the EditItemComponent does depend on the path to the left of it, it only shows up if you match/admin/itemroute (the /admin part of the route was from the lazy loading of the admin module). 

issue: I want to build an angular app to production environment.  What is better? 'Compile'  the assets or store the assets on the machine server?  Thanks! 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Any idea? 
solution: dgroh: i think if you uninstall source-map-explorer you will still have same error, no?. I hadimport 'core-js/es7/reflect';inpolyfills.ts?commented out. 

issue: alxhub: , nice !  have you a branch in your github with this work ? 
solution: alxhub: , it's actually well advanced ! Still a little effort ;). 

issue: good mornin 
solution: hes calming down a little. hes a new guy so i think hes realizing his place. 

issue: phenomnomnominal: I'm on 5.1.2 and node v8.9.4 
solution: 

issue: wait, you can only pipe 10 operators? 
solution: either way, I think rob has a good point about it being a sanity thing. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: alxhub: ,@fugwennahe's going to need to implement his own http wrapper regardless.. better to extend http to include the functionality than compose a side-polymorph that can only be used in his services, imo. 

issue: what, so NO css is being included for that component? 
solution: Fyi, this is a client's codebase so I'm walking into it cold, but this is one of the first things I noticed.. 

issue:  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->]  [<-ISSUE->] is where they dropped intl btw 
solution: EreckGordon:. means equivalent i am using version4 angular.  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: is this perhaps a regression in testing functionality caused by the new http client? 
solution: timothyblue: it lets you tellHttpClientwhether you want the body, response, or all events back.. I GET IT I GET IT!!! :Oif I name my request I can peek into it!. 

issue: Anyone here know how I can get both the old value and new value of a select tag on Angular 4? 
solution: 

issue: hello guys, i want to understand the meaning of  "observable sequence"  specialy the keyword sequence, ty 
solution: mlc-mlapis: Most operators take an observable sequence and perform some logic on it and output another observable sequence. In addition, as you can see from our code samples, you can even chain multiple operators on a source sequence to tweak the resulting sequence to your exact requirement.. 

issue: is it dogecoing? 
solution: 

issue: what about css grid? 
solution: flex is still one love. lazarljubenovic: , yes, [<-LINK->]. This screen-shot is taken from the link [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Version requirements for what? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] This implies the return type for the function. 
solution: RubixFailsAtCode: well obviously that was my first idea, however: Type 'Observable<Object>' is not assignable to type 'Observable<TAUser[]>'.. 

issue: Is there a way to set date input to year only in angular 4? 
solution: Babyswizz_twitter: year is not vaild date so it will not work to se ony the year on html input tag with type date, but you could use some other type (like text or number) and observe the change and on the same convert that year to some date what you want.. 

issue: Is anyone here based in London too :) ? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] guys pls help me  [<-LINK->] 
solution: rhmnmbr83: you AppMenuComponent not exist in provider[] of module. 

issue: ViewContainerRef dosent know what a component is inside it's view 
solution: from the parent I am using, i get an [ elementRef object ] by using this:@ViewChildren(\'nodetarget\') gissa: QueryList<SSSNodeComponent>;if( this.gissa ) { console.log("this.gissa", this.gissa.toArray()); }.

solution: 

issue: Hi ! [<-CODE->] 
solution: paolomainardi: i already use a map operator in a ApiService that return a mapped element to my ItemService. Does it change something to your answer ?. geekman75000: no it remains the same. 

issue: is vue better than angular? 
solution: i mean , vue is getting more popularity, and github stars than angular. well clearly it's better than. 

issue: === true :( 
solution: are you adding the html to the right component. yeah. 

issue: How do I tell where theDOMRecttype is? 
solution: i don't think it's a big deal, it's not like it's an asynch call to a service. 

issue: +2 
solution: 

issue: any suggestions on interview questions for that? 
solution: denisemauldin: Maybe you could have them create a small app that generates a form or something. With the CLI you should be able to do that in a day I would think.. 

issue: Is there any type for json object  ( {} ) in TS ? 
solution: 

issue: justwhatare you building? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] please help why i am getting this and how to resolve this  any 1 from any corner 
solution: 

issue: angular-cli isnt installed globally? 
solution: it must be. 

issue: Should I encrypt username and password that gets sent to server ? If I use Https, is that enough? 
solution: owlstack: https is plenty. no point in encrypting it on client. @owlstack https is plenty. no point in encrypting it on client+1. Also, what if user logs into web app and I want to store user info in a cookie for persistence. 

issue: Can't he just make a user service and then inject it into the parent and children? 
solution: denisemauldin: probably wouldn't work in a routing environment. 

issue: hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm my form is defaulting to not pristine if I populate it with data from my resolver nope, its my custom form fields so now the question is "why"? or more specifically "how"? 
solution: I have a "field" that is actually a subform, but I want to treat it as an ngModel so its a "custom field"... the property linked to ngModel is a list of strings.  the control gets a list of all the options from the api.  the control then lists all of them as checkboxes that are on or off depending on wether or not that option appears in the ngModel\'s list. 

issue: I'd also chime in with my g-rated version of my famous quote just because you can, doesnt mean you should 
solution: 

issue: Attempting to use the AOT compiler in a test? 
solution: I almost wonder if this isnt like a need to do a full blown rebuild or something. 

issue: sorry guys, but has anybody experiencie migrating AngularJS app to Angular app (making an hybrid app)? 
solution: 

issue: any idea how i can wrap this normal function with a callback into an observable? [<-CODE->] 
solution: derekkite: yer it worked  for one of my methods buy failed for another, post about it is a bit further up, no-one seemed to know the fix so ill fall back to this :). ChrisDevinePimss: :) I tried bindCallback a while ago and found it very fussy. The callback parameters are not consistent on callbacks, likely that is what went wrong.. 

issue: Nope 
solution: But I am still unable to render the image using the url I am creating. 

issue: hello guys what mean this type of error? Uncaught Error: Can't resolve all parameters for ModalDemoComponent: (?). 
solution: 

issue: Anyone here have exsperiance using Observable.bindCallback()? 
solution: 

issue: i'm worried that its baking in opinions that i can't opt out of (especially if i know what i'm doing?) 
solution: Also this is only when you actually access the methods onStateTransfer. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Anyone have any ideas what may be causing this? 
solution: 

issue: any help? 
solution: 

issue: Hello could anyone help me with angular communication with components? I have sub component into my page that are not updating 
solution: 

issue: how do i test a service with observables? :O 
solution: yeah, it's not even a service, but i need to fake it to ask a question in angular chatroom :P. 

issue: you have them all?!?! 
solution: 

issue: No - router doesn't depend on HTTP at all. It's likely because you're trying to injectHttpClientinto the interceptor. 
solution: alxhub: each call to my backend has to have an http header such as 'X-Foo-Target': 'foo-post'. Is it possible to to write an http interceptor that will accept a parameter for each call to facilitate this. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] how do i search more than 100 page 
solution: i got only 100 pages but i want more. 

issue: Can you show us where CompareDeviceParameters is declared?  I think we're having problems as to why this doesn't work as is. 
solution: sahilkatia: that's not global it is a public property of your class. All methods of your class have access to it. Are you getting errors for trying to access an undefined variable or are you not getting the right value...? It should work as is. 

issue: Is there any danger in putting an async on an ngOnInit()?  I'm loading my FormGroup with calls to my service that I need to await. 
solution: 

issue: Is there a best practice for listening to events on buttons? 
solution: I am using a component calledion-auto-completewhich hold anion-searchbarcomponent that contains aclearbutton.  This button emits anionClearevent toion-auto-complete, but that event is not exposed to the client. 

issue: app.modules or component module? 
solution: realbardaxx_twitter: what you call component module ? eric's right and I was you never call udpate() because you never providers[] it. can you indicate in which file and which row?. i have to remove providers inside dropdown-label. 

issue: were you subscribed to, or were you just waiting to talk about the great places? 
solution: 

issue: also, why aren’t you refreshing before the token expires? 
solution: well that didnt work. TYPE ERROR: TypeError: You provided 'undefined' where a stream was expected. You can provide an Observable, Promise, Array, or Iterable.. 

issue: the ng-select one? 
solution: yeah. I like the end result well enough... though it seems like it does way more than a select potentially need sto. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: the last time I looked at it, there was still SIGNIFICANT developer overhead in initial dev and maintenance. ronnyek: ngrx/entity handles a lot of your CRUD code but requires its own pile of boilerplate but ngrx has a schematics library that handles most of that boiler plate for you. 

issue: Link? 
solution: not 100% the same as what im attempting to do but still. abstract just means you cant create an instance of the class. usually an extendable class. 

issue: Is it possible to have a shared module that lazy loads some components and eager loads some other components? 
solution: 

issue: is it getting assigned to this.myForm? 
solution: yes@jgladen.  [<-LINK->]. works in stackblitz. varun07: looking at it now. 

issue: I read the object constructor or functions might be different, of which i care 0 about.  I string'd the objects and got it working.  Feels dodgy :D 
solution: 

issue: Anyone know a good way to deep compare two objects in a karma unit test? 
solution: Maybe i need to either get a package or just expect each property.  I've turned all the google links purple hah. 

issue: there's no reason to use pug with angular, but otherwise it's a nice templating language no bullshit just writing 
solution: 

issue: yo dog we heard you like html so we put a DSL in yo html 
solution: you define mixins and components that get replaced build-time. 

issue: only 5 thousand? which ones did you cut out :D 
solution: so i used ngc for "everything ngc and not tsc" :). 

issue: Speaking of pipe... whats with that?  Why are wepipeinstead of just calling the map/filter? 
solution: 

issue: Good morning people I had a dream last night where I was an Observable emitting vacation spots Morning ereck 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: phenomnomnominal: any idea of type forthis.hostEl = this.renderer.selectRootElement(this.ngHostEl).nativeElement;a native element?. You can also use more specific ones.

issue: how to I turn a string into thisexport type StructureLevelString = 'PROCEDURE' | 'UNIT_PROCEDURE' | 'OPERATION' | 'PHASE'; 
solution: although I guess my situation is a little more dumb, because I actually have to call http.get on my items at each level, because right now my rest endpoint is dumb (I'll fix it later, right now I'm prototyping). 

issue: hello guys i have a problem core.js:1276 Uncaught Error: StaticInjectorError[{provide:PlatformLocation, useClass:BrowserPlatformLocation}]: 'deps' required anyone  know the problem ? 
solution: 

issue: can you change the API? 
solution: phenomnomnominal: i'd just double check you havn't left a ref to anything, there are a couple of issues on githb relating to memory leaks, i'd check those out. lazarljubenovic: That I was more referring to if I havehttp.get<{whatever: string}>().subscribe(result)or http.get<{whatever: MyCustomStringEnumType}>().subscribe()` result would the types be smart enough to work themselves out, but I guess you are right. The underlying javascript probably doesn't care... and maybe typescript doesn't care either?. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: how to insert <script> into angular? 
solution: jplew: not working, no call on script. 

issue: how are you loading it? 
solution: Toxicable: as in@InjectableRepository <TModel> and then some kind of reflection to map fields to salute columns?Can that be done in typescript? Id need something like a c# attribute (Decorator maybe?) to state what fields should be persisted, or fallback to no typing with an array of prop names to persist.. 

issue: ghetolay: I gave a try (a bit late --') but it's not getting deactivated :/ 
solution: ghetolay: when I use a resolver, I think it's nice being able to not use observable to retrieve the good data has something is supposed to do that beforehand.So if I still need to use an observable to check if data have changed, why wouldn't I just drop the resolver and use the router directly to watch new arguments and get the data I want every time it changes. 

issue: how are you importing it? are you really doing loadMemberDetail or LoadMemberDetail ? (capital vs lowercase L) 
solution: hard to say without seeing a stackblitz or plunkr. yeah it’s cool was hoping something would be obvious… thanks though. hungerregnuh: you have MembersAtionTypes.LoadMemberDetail and LoadMemberDetail. Is there a collision?. 

issue: Hello!  I am wondering if anyone can help with this error (Cannot read property 'find' of undefined) 
solution: akashbanginwar: you have an array that you are calling .find on and the array doesn't exist. derekkite: if i do this this.performanceByRun.map(row => [row.runDate, row.effectiveDepth.effectiveDepthRatio]) its working. 

issue: who made this s**t? react much easier. 
solution: keonsam: lots of people made it. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] You mean that @Input and ChangeDetectionStrategy won't work with string property? 
solution: if@Inputand CDS don't work with primitive data, why it work with boolean value like true/false that I often see in material component?. 

issue: jgornick: ... display where ... in the template it is:{{myInput.value}} 
solution: jgornick: ... but probably not a good idea to use the same namemyInputforformControlName="myInput"and also for#myInput.... jgornick: ... it has to work ... it is the correct syntax. 

issue: I'm doing a personal project and I don't has content any recommendations?

solution: i have using owl carousal slider with caption  for angular 5. 

issue: what do youwantto do? 
solution: 

issue: isn\'t there "on same navigation reload" option? 
solution: but going through these thre urls. causes a weirdExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedErrorerror.  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: yes you can run Angular in Electron 
solution: But is it hard to move exising app to electron?. I can build app in Electron on Angular from scratch. It is really easy. I know this. What about moving exising app to electron environment? Thats the question.. 

issue: are you sending a boolean via http? 
solution: wrap it in a json object. {"result": true}. 

issue: for what 
solution: 

issue: is it your service? 
solution: sounds like somethign specific to your codebase. I let my ide figure that crapola out. 

issue: how do you use a npm library in angular 5 ? 
solution: you import it like always. 

issue: I have a problem with rendering recursive table in Angular [<-LINK->] Anybody has an idea? 
solution: 

issue: any ideas wherelocalStorageis coming from ? [<-LINK->] 
solution: would you put the codeLocalStorageabove in to foldercore/decoratorsor in to foldercore/services?it is definetly not a service just thougt thatdecoratorsfolder should do.. thoughts?. 

issue: out of the box, VS Code merges imports, but it doesn't remove unused imports, afaik 
solution: if you dont use those things, then value differences may be negligible. 

issue: lephyrus: you on gitter by any chance? 
solution: are you using something for pluralization?. fxck: no.. 

issue: @lazarljubenovic"isEditMode"is there a way to set focus on input in that declarative way? I didn\'t use that before 
solution: lazarljubenovic: but still, you not answered :) Is it possible to set focus in declarative way as you mentioned earlier? On simple input. 

issue: Can anyone check if I made a mistake somewhere; for some reason headers aren't set properly;; [<-CODE->] 
solution: sklipnoty: afaik Angular\'s HttpHeaders are immutable, they always return new instance on every "mutation". 

issue: hi guys, anyone is having experience with ag-grid here ? 
solution: Oviduzz: I suppose you could inject a service into them and use an observable. but if you are using a valueGetter in the one that needs to be notified, it should recompute its value automatically if the other colulmn's value changes. 

issue: see your git log? 
solution: Is it any source controlled repo? If not, just make a local git repo and please just commit your changes. Otherwise it's going to be a pain.. 

issue: split('?')[1] 
solution: 

issue: isnt it just scoped to highest level its injected? 
solution: eg if component is the highest level I inject, every place its injected as a subcomponent to this component would return the same instance. right. 

issue: does cli do some css optimization? well it sucks at it how do i turn it off 
solution: i cannot find this "feature" documented. lazarljubenovic: hahaha he wants to customize cli, poor guy. 

issue: hey guys :) 
solution: 

issue: morning where u from 
solution: merlin2049er: Redmond, WA. 

issue: hey question.  I am converting a site that used master pages. and I thought all of the links should be components. Is this the best way? 
solution: well when I route to a page, it will replace the whole page, so do I need to copy header and footer info to each page, or should I componentize the header and footer separate. and display the compents in the page without doing routing. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: The values coming across in theObservableare arrays of strings.. that makes sense, but why in this example is the single callback using numbers: [<-LINK->]. In almost every case, operators do not know or care that your values are arrays.. 

issue: what am I missing to have components i.e. <com></com> show up on the screen? 
solution: that's a bold statement. well what do you say to the most generic angular question of all time. 

issue: What is that? 
solution: 

issue: The angular cli uses webpack to build, right? 
solution: although ngc is considerably slower than tsc. 

issue: jesus calm down with the updates firefox 
solution: dang… i haven’t used FF in ages… used it briefly after the huge perf update seems slick. 

issue: how to quote someone? xD 
solution: that's alt clicking the timestamp. 

issue: aaah… that’s how you do that quote dealie 
solution: not that i know of. you can put your mouse over to the side until the…shows then click quote. 

issue: hilarious mental blank.... how do you dynamically set a style in the template? 
solution: that takes an object tho right?. guess it still gets the job done.... sam-s4s: np. 

issue: or 
solution: 

issue: Off-topic: Congratulations to@Toxicable [<-LINK->] 
solution: amazonalexabot_twitter: mostly with hot observables you can "miss" values if you subscribe at a certain period in time (u miss the ones emited before). With cold ones you cant.. 

issue: Anybody successfully mocked a module with a default import with Jest ? 
solution: BustyLoli-Chan: you should have a service in shared module. provide that service by forRoot static method. then in the component bind [innerHTML]="template". maxime1992: you could use import { default as Name } from 'module';. 

issue: can i tree-shake templates? by env variables?  [<-CODE->] would this work? 
solution: lazarljubenovic: just make it a router outlet, push the route to the routes array in an if, tree-shake that. 

issue: keep commenting stuff out until you find it :P 
solution: So I have*ngIf="isLoggedIn()|async"and that gets called over and over until my ref count blows op on my Observable. 

issue: what's the nature of the loop? 
solution: 

issue: what is genDir for? 
solution: 

issue: i'm getting from  [<-CODE->] 
solution: maracay: are you from Maracay? D:. michaeljota: yeap. 

issue: which ng 
solution: i mean, you could try to just rm the stuff out of usr/bin and usr/lib but be careful. 

issue: WilliamBowen: yeah or make a file called polyfills.ts and import it into main to avoid clutter either 
solution: 

issue: wow keg of beer is a generous offering 
solution: Yeah, no kidding, haha.. the caveat is he's going to force him to drink it all before he can leave. Weston, the number of times i’ve popped in here over the last year and Alex has helped me out.. a keg’s hardly enough lol. 

issue: wouldn't that have to run through the compiler to work? 
solution: 

issue: :O 
solution: 

issue: Can I npm publish from a different folder than the dist one? how do I do the thing? :o 
solution: so I have kind of a tricky question... or maybe it isn't that tricky.... 

issue: how isangular-reduxcomparing withngrx/store? 
solution: so I will use that one if I ever introduce redux to an angular app. i only used ngrx but I was curious about other libs that introduce redux pattern in angular. yep, I do not have any issues besides the tons of classes that I need to add to have type safety inside the reducers. 

issue: 1.7.x i believe 
solution: 

issue: I have some questions related to Angular 5, am i in the right place? 
solution: 

issue: what's the issue? 
solution: 

issue: Guys please helpI have this code: [<-CODE->] and when i click submit button nothing happens, but when i delete formControl from email input it starts working. Where is problem? 
solution: I can't remember exactly right now, but in my recollection angular prevents forms from submitting the normal way - I think because in a single page app you don't want forms sending someone to another page, it should use ajax.. 

issue: don't you want ContentChild ? is the child directly part of the template ? 
solution: ContentChildit is still undefined. Not sure I follow with directly part of the template. parent is a componentuser-list is within that and there is the actual list within user-list which is the this-is-what-I-want thing. 

issue: what's new 
solution: 

issue: 'i' keeps changing. What would 'i' represent? what are you trying to accomplish? 
solution: and I am setting value as i. 

issue: I want to share some logic from a component with other components (some parsing, calculation for pagination etc.). What do you advise me to use? Inheritance, create separate module/class?... 
solution: robwormald: but still I could ofc create a separate service from handle this other (non HTTP related) stuff in another service. Is that what you are saying?. 

issue: that's normal, if you want a non mandatory field to be validated when empty 
solution: understood, but you can put a required validation,. I can do a lot of stuff but I can also think that a minLength requires a minimum string length. 

issue: APP_INITIALIZER can be used in lazy loaded modules? 
solution: if I want to get some module settings from server as soon as the module loads and before anything else how can I do it?. but since server request will be async. I don't think you can hold the initialization. 

issue: why is this throwing a type error: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] I am… confused 
solution: oh… I have to make it self invoking?. self invoking dosen't make any sense here, you're giving it a function, it dosen't want a function. 

issue: what's new ? 
solution: 

issue: Hmmm why am I getting a staticInjector error with the following provider? I\'ve been trying to use injectable as "constants", more or less as an experiment. [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: So, every example of ControlValueAccessor implementation of things shows the error display for the objdect being done outside the custom input.  I want to be able to implement ControlValueAccessor and also display the errors along with the input so that it's all encapsulated. [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: Toxicable: @jotatoledoThe simplest example with a counter in React. In order to detect changes. We must somehow signal this to React. Therefore, in our case, we must manually call setState. Thus we call the diff-algorithm, which checks our virtual tree in memory, and finds the difference between the real DOM tree. And the changes that he found, he understands that it is necessary to redraw.. 

issue: Checking for updates every 2 seconds is way too fast. 
solution: It also detects the update but i dont get an alert console log or reload. 

issue: Hey guys. Can I do something like this? [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: but that shouldn't matter. If you use a shared service, like the final example in the link I sent, you will provide your service inapp.module.ts, or whatever. So both your components can use the same singleton instance of that service.. 

issue: this.createSocket(...).retrywhat is this? 
solution: instead I can just sayimport { Observable, Subscription } from 'rxjs';and it just works. 

issue: I'm having a bit of difficulty understanding using multiple router outlets... can i have a router outlet inside another outlet? 
solution: rohitsodhia: I use them for child routs, but I believe you can also name them. 

issue: me too! 
solution: 

issue: I have a question. I need to copy over my angular /dist folder from my local drive to a remote location via ssh. How can I do that? what's the command? 
solution: owlstack: yeah, any time you need info about a linux command you can typeman [command]in your terminal if you want to read the docs.. owlstack: an example with rsync:rsync -rave "ssh -l username" --stats --progress ./ ftp.myhost.com:~/www/shared/dist. 

issue: hi  there!! i\'m looking for a way to make an app in angular5 and has this to be inserted in another page like <script src="..."></script> and shows like a chat windows there.. any ideas where to start? 
solution: there was some new stuff one of the angular devs was experimenting I think, that would let yo ubuild components and effectively compile them to stand alone components (dragging internals of angular along with it). 

issue: Muhammad, what is it doing ? 
solution: kasparov112000:.  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Hey everybody, just a general question: doesangular/angulartrack code coverage and if so, where can I find stats? 
solution: 

issue: Oh,@alxhub, earlier when you were saying module factory, did you mean like this:loadChildren: () => AdminModule? Or did I misunderstand that? 
solution: In JIT mode it should returnAdminModule, in AOT mode you have to return the factory.. Well, then probably better I give up on that entirely? I actually tried getting the lazy loading working, but couldn't get that working either. 

issue: What happens if I callRouterModule.forRoottwice? 
solution: I know mostly I was messing around, but I figure thats a good way to learn. 

issue: can anyone recommend a logger library for angular ? 
solution: varunet: this looks cool: [<-LINK->]. Also: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: I do on and off 
solution: 

issue: @Toxicablequestion for you, yarn over npm reasons? 
solution: Toxicable: that hardly matters when I'm sucking in source and building stuff from scratch on a build server =). want to run a scriptnpm:npm run scriptyarn:yarn script. 

issue: anyone know of a good datatable lib ? 
solution: ekarlso: Angular Material Datatable is real good.. 

issue: *clue 
solution: jotatoledo:. I would suggest you to first read the forms guide carefully, seems like you dont realy understand how the reactive forms api works. 

issue: amivit: how do you use it ? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: is proactor easy to learn? 
solution: but hes saying hes doing fetching of data and stuff. 

issue: the "inline" bundle is literally for inline CSS support ? random question 
solution: {{addedItem.type}} value of it coming from web services. 

issue: I keep hearing people say Angular Universal,@EreckGordon. What does that mean? 
solution: it has bindings for expressjs (and nestjs cause it wraps express), hapi, asp.net. otherwise you can use platformServer and wire it up by hand, which essentially what universal has done. 

issue: can i know if an event has been registered (via an output)? apparently yes [<-LINK->] 
solution: I have a somewhat complex issue, that I can solve in a an explicit (ugly) way but our routes are getting very nested, and I am wondering if anyone one here has any ideas or if possible( I have not found anything).. I basically would ideally like to be able to support '/' in in my route params. I guess a little regex matching . We have routes for a tool that is a cms for our ecommerce site and we have been building our routes to match - so we have things like :family/:category/:subcategory all going through the same component so its just basically recursive.  I have never liked the routes file here to begin with have to explicitly match for each of these params where I would like to match all past, or all in between (wildcardy) like path: 'page/*slug/versions/:version_id' or something. 

issue: do you think it's worth it to generate a test suite? is it hard to do? I mean, how do you simulate calls to apis and stuff 
solution: also I think you were right@ronnyekseparating my routes into twopath: ''where one loads the parent component and the other doesn't worked quite well. Thank you!!!. 

issue: what is the use of [<-CODE->] in httpClient ? if the api returns the json data, why should we do this ? 
solution: or the new if you observe the response rather than just the body result. rashnk: who says that you should in the first place?. rashnk: an interface defining the expected result. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] and how to fix that? 
solution: derekkite: that is my service I am injecting. that is different problem I think somehow related to that [<-ISSUE->] but I didnt figure out yetthe error is sayingCannot read property 'subscribe' of undefined. 

issue: DOES ANGULAR 5 USES VIRTUAL DOM? 
solution: Angular uses a Change Detection strategy to propagate changes from model to view. It's a different approach than vdom.. 

issue: @Iamguy84Try [<-CODE->] 
solution: embryologist: because i want to display loop through checkbox inside the formarrayname. 

issue: I\'m getting "Property \'subscribe\' does not exist on type \'UnaryFunction" and I\'m not sure why: [<-CODE->] 
solution: amazonalexabot_twitter: wild guess would be wrong import of operators. should I import from /rxjs/operators or /rxjs/operators/{operator}. 

issue: how to pass css up to a parent container? 
solution: ronnyek:. you could override with the !important crapola. 

issue: Hi how do I preserve enter spaces of textarea I have form, which takes input through textarea, I want to preserve the 'enter' and save that and save the data as json 
solution: 

issue: why would the cdref be undefined? lifecycle thing 
solution: viewChild won’t be set until after viewInit so that makes sense… but i would’ve thunk that cdRef would be defined before the inputs are ran. 

issue: hi!Is there a gist template for angular5?I'd like to reproduce an issue and share it with gist. 
solution: I am looking for something like this: [<-LINK->] It is a very minimal shell that loads the framework. And it can be executed withgist.run. [<-LINK->] Instead of Aurelia, I'd like to do the same thing with Angular.. 

issue: subscribe to cancer and spy the next function ? 
solution: ghetolay: I was thinking of having the method return a bool. 

issue: Stupid observables question I have posted: [<-LINK->] I'm sure it's related to casting but not sure what part 
solution: 

issue: Anyone have any opinions on a good file-picker lib for angular 2+? 
solution: I did file upload lately, but I did it by myself, no libs - but very simple use case. 

issue: @alan-agius4Also any reason why material2 won’t follow suit?who said taht?someone explain what and who will use all of thesebundlers/optimization tools 
solution: @Toxicable Re. APF 6. I was referring that angular material won't follow suit because in the google docs, there is no mention that they will ship fesm and fesm 2015 togather with esm and esm 2015. (Maybe it's still not updated) cause I noticed some other errors in there.Re who uses them, I know it's the bundlers, but I was more into who uses which entry. Example, who uses the entry fesm2015 over esm2015 in package.json? etc.... 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] or [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: rohitsodhia: Can you provide an example/article/doc demonstrating the above scenario using input/service?. I haven't used an EventEmitter as an input, but don't seem unreasonable. 

issue: when does your Observable emit? what causes it to emit? 
solution: alxhub: Yes. Got the emit working. Now just trying to figure out how to bind my dataModel to the formGroup values.. 

issue: who says that? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I was wondering how can I save data locally when I'm fetching it from server? 
solution: owlstack: you can use localstorage aswell if it doesn't require a lot of memory. 

issue: try ? it 
solution: it put all the values of this class in a value object. 

issue: 5 
solution: 

issue: I am having a run time error when aot flag is on [<-CODE->] without it app works 
solution: No provider for ethis is the minified name of the token, which is not very helpful, therefore by running it in dev mode we're able to see the actual name of the token and debug it. 

issue: Sorry@alxhub, when you say composition, what are you referring to? I don't know if I missed some context. 
solution: rohitsodhia: I've got my FormGroup stuff working the way I want it. I can put together a stackblitz today if you are interested in seeing it.. 

issue: Try to declare an interface for your data, like this: [<-CODE->] And iterate like this : [<-CODE->] 
solution: EkiGui: sir, it givesjs   [tslint] Shadowed name: 'MyData' (no-shadowed-variable). rdtomar: Seems like you already have a variable named “MyData”, use an other name for your interface (the [<-LINK->] for theno-shadowed-variablerule). 

issue: hmmm so universal is basically appshell? 
solution: oooh gotcha, gotta look into both some day. 

issue: cause class doesn't add any value and are more cumbersome to instantiate 
solution: ghetolay: But interface is not for this purpose. either for an object or class. 

issue: hi, how do i animate in Angular with CSSanimateproperty? oh, one second 
solution: artuska: Check out@angular/animations. well, it is hard to google keywordanimate‘cos it leads to the Angular Animations documentation. 

issue: what is the lifecycle hook called when the router url changed in angular app? 
solution: dsandeepchary: ... probably it is related to the case when you already routed to some component and that component injectActivatedRoute... and subscribe to its observables.. 

issue: Does anyone know how to trigger a Child Component function from a Parent Container Component? 
solution: Make the person setting the input tell you when deep properties change, if you need to know.. 

issue: Did you declare the directive in your app module@denisemauldin? 
solution: You should be importing the module supplied by the package. Just the same as your own directives and components; they can't be declared more than once either. 

issue: speaking of positions - I have an interview on Wednesday - anybody have opinions on the salary range for an angular developer? I am in the Pac NW 
solution: I've been coding professionally 2 years and I definitely feel like scrub. seekheart: That just means you are still sharpening your tool set! I bet you know alot!. I started about 27 years ago but I didn't sell my fist commercial program till 1997. 

issue: oh wow I'm sadly too scrub to apply :( 
solution: I've been coding professionally for 20+ years and I still feel like a newbie every day.. 

issue: :D 
solution: 

issue: When I give someone the answer and they say they implemented it but they show code that doesn't have it implemented, it kinda discourages me from answering again... 
solution: rohitsodhia: I totally get it. I got slammed yesterday and didn't have time to put it up. I'm working from home today so it is a bit quieter.. timothyblue: No worries... I\'m off to SF next weekend, so I need to adjust all my personal work schedules and get a bunch of tutorials/coursea work done ahead of time, which is leaving me a bit of a "review" stack. 

issue: are they on the same route? 
solution: 

issue: Send a string? 
solution: 

issue: does anyone see anything wrong with just sending mS since the UNIX Epoc? i trust you guys 
solution: robertbrower-technologies: alsong as all parts of your system understand it's a UNIX Epoc (which is UTC). I think if it is the conventional way in the system then it seems the best browser independent way to deliver date time.. 

issue: One of those requests could be a preflight? 
solution: It’s not rly a problem it’s just checking to see if it can do POST. 

issue: hi guys i am facing a strange problem 
solution: So i am using a Guard which refreshes all the api calls when user hits ctrl f5. now if i use chrome duplicate tab my Guard is not hit. because of that app fails as api calls are not hydrating data to the local storage service. 

issue: so i need  same estiamtion from you experiment peaple haw longer would take at worst  ? 
solution: that's a near impossible question to answer. there are so many factors that influence that answer. project complexity, current state of the source code, documentation of it, implementation, etc etc. 

issue: o.O 
solution: 

issue: Can someone please shed some light on why this validation isn\'t working? quantity: {type: Number, min:[1, "Quantity must be greater than 0."]} Currently my form is letting me submit if quantity is empty 
solution: 

issue: +1 
solution: 

issue: That and, if you're not adding any methods, why make a class for it? 
solution: You COULD make a class and create a method to export the values to save to local storage, but it's overkill. 

issue: guys need to display  a route tree like this and delete Details once I click on author as here [<-LINK->] any idea to achieve it?? 
solution: 

issue: Y 
solution: 

issue: does anybody know why does this work: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Hi can anyone help me out I want to use P5.js in my angular app. Please help me here [<-LINK->] 
solution: I have done that . But now while doingimport * from 'p5'There is an error it is  searching forp5.d.tswhich is not there. 

issue: why not use the normal apis for dynamic components then? componentFactoryResolver and what not 
solution: Toxicable: I might do that.. I wanted to implement something like@alxhubwas showing: [<-LINK->]. it was a demo, not a final product. 

issue: what kind of API is it? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: guys, with rxjs 6.x upgrade what will this statement be replaced with? [<-CODE->] I am having same experience with cli, upgrade process is pretty painful because of reliance on angular cli 
solution: 

issue: Hey@Toxicableare all the operators like that now? 
solution: I can finally import in piece lol. media could not be played. 

issue: alias of what? 
solution: I want to pointimport { Things } from 'my-lib'tomy-lib.tsat dev time andmy-lib.jsat prod. Toxicable: yeah, but can you have different ones from dev and prod?. 

issue: import { of } from ‘rxjs/observable/add’I think 
solution: Is next angular gonna use rxjs6?. seekheart: @asadsahiimport { of } from 'rxjs/observable/of';. 

issue: oh..@ToxicabledeployUrlfixed it :| 
solution: clearly still getting used to the CLI game. 

issue: ... you mean you are using[innerHTML]="anyProperty"? ... or Angular Universal ... which render a part of a page on a server side? 
solution: 

issue: +1 
solution: 

issue: so I used like, windows at uni :D All my linux knowledge is from stuff in my spare time 
solution: but stuff under src/ complains, but compiles fine. 

issue: Hey I am still trying to get used to having my user prefs in a scrambled egg (token) :) 
solution: user prefs in a token? ewww… that’s too heavy for a token.... 

issue: The node install went fine, did not ask for xcode, but loop persists 
solution: 

issue: how old is you rmac? i have a mid-2012 running high sierra no issues 
solution: Jeez 2009 late I think. ouch… bummer - install linux :D. so nobody is using the latest on 10.11 ? So no reason to work it?. 

issue: Can anyone tell me why this doesn't work?<div [style.backgroundColor]='red'></div> 
solution: deathgaze: 'red' is looking for a variable called red. my guess: single quote signifies a variable defined in  your ts. double quote lets it know that red is just a string. 

issue: look how styled they are so fancyu "quotes" “macintosh quotes” 
solution: I mutate through event, and child does not react. martabrzeszczyk: It seems to work for me? When I clickBuy CarIt adds a car to the child.. 

issue: can someone tell me how to preseve the state of a component on a route?? 
solution: think of a list —> detail view, each has a route.  On the list view I have filters that apply to the list. They aren’t part of the detail view, but when I navigate back the filters are being recreated.. 

issue: compiler host is where it caches previous runs 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Hi, What opacity value should I add to make these color transparent instead of 0.2? 
solution: Note that your top values are listed asrgbinstead ofrgba- probably a mistake. 

issue: <input [required]="mypublicmember"> 
solution: dalu: is it obvious or there is something like that in Angular docs?. but if an attr is assigned dynamically then your wrap it in[]. 

issue: Does typescript has it's own date primitive? 
solution: So I just uselet date: Date = new Date(Date.now());?. let date: Date = new Date();same thing. but yes that gets the current time. 

issue: hello 
solution: and for all popups they have write the css in style.css of angular app. so css of each popup is common. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] ? 
solution: 

issue: What is TypeScript equivalent of C# DateTime? Is it DateTimeFormat? 
solution: Just be warned Date will include your local time.. I got rid of it with momentJs. 

issue: EreckGordon: here's a simplified version of what I'm doing now. Does this make sense? Just looking for a sanity check, is all :O [<-CODE->] 
solution: you could create a Subject and return it as an observable and then in your promises's then(), you can do subject.next(value). 

issue: Ng serve -o 
solution: 

issue: set value to what ? 
solution: 

issue: i kind of dropped the ball on getting my company send me :\\ 
solution: 

issue: Don't you want at least 5.6? Or maybe one of the later 5.5s 
solution: 

issue: Are there a lot of material changes? 
solution: But that also has a tool which will do it for you. i would feel strange if material didnt keep changing. been refactoring apps since it was alpha heh. 

issue: Automatic inspection of Angular. Not affected 
solution: @coderishu Angular utilizes zones to know when an event is fully processed by patching some async APIs like (addEventHandler, setTimeout, ...) and then runs change detection after each event.In dev mode Angular does an additional change detection run, just after the first one. Because there was no event in between, no change should have happened.If the model still changed, Angular considers this to be a possible bug.That\'s exactly it. In development mode the change detection runs a second time and compares the current value with the first run.If the value differs, then it "thinks" that the change was caused by itself. That\'s why it throws. However this doesn\'t happen in production mode with enableProdMode().. 

issue: after what ? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: looks like they updated that. when it went from md-whatever to mat-whatever that tool was a very smooth change. Be careful with that though, it only just got committed , i wouldn't expect there to be no bugs. 

issue: ah yes, that's required for JIT, still needs to dynamiclly Reflect are you referencingReflectanywhere? 
solution: another thing is, the files generated withng build —prodare like 10mb, unminified etc.. I aint gonna inspect that for ya. 

issue: any remarks? why? it works 
solution: it toggles state but not DOM. it does not. 

issue: I swear angular is inferior in every aspect than angularjs, how is it unable to handlewhile(1);//json here 
solution: but depending on where you're at in the app, that side bar makes no sense and i'd rather have screen real estate so i emit events based on the route to open/close the side bar. 

issue: Hello, Does anyone know async alternative for Rx.Observable.from() ?I'm new to angular and RxJS 
solution: EreckGordon: , i need to convert an array of different api endpoint url's to array of observables of http requests and subscribe to them, order does not matter. 

issue: how to get response statuscode fromthis code  [<-CODE->] 
solution: Http requests return an observable, you need to subscribe to it to get data/response from it. Use HttpClient instead and add , { observe: 'response' } to your http requests code in order to get the whole response.. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] Why  folders arent available?  [<-LINK->] i will install cli g 
solution: 

issue: you want me to upload that on git or something like that? 
solution: or you can setup your repo directly at [<-LINK->]. so I can directly check from there. ibuli: i fix it. 

issue: IMO it wont be possible to directly read any params data at app.component lvl withouth router events logic 
solution: 

issue: BustyLoli-Chan:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: How to check if a checkbox is checked in Angular 4? 
solution: It is just a list of addresses. Ramya-Bronson:  [<-LINK->]. I think you will grasp the idea. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] | Why my date is not sorting out? 
solution: raineer24: an array with 1 item sorted is still the same array since there is only 1 item.. 

issue: By using 2 loops?@ghetolay 
solution: Sort the array in one loop based on id and then pass the data to the next loop which sorts in depending on the date. But now I realize it doesn't make sense :D. then we're back at my first statement since your second array only has 1 element. 

issue: Does core have a core.metadata.json file in it? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Anyone who unit tests know the relationship betweenHttpClientTestingBackendandHttpTestingController? 
solution: alxhub: I figured, but didn’t want to be pushy and ping you directly :P   I’m mocking things fine with HttpTestingController but then I stumbled upon HttpTestingBackend, and in the testing module definition ( [<-LINK->] ) it just provides the backend for the controller?. 

issue: You have "console.clear()" somewhere 
solution: ericmartinezr: i dont think so. Well, I don't think it's doing automagically by itself....  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Hey guys, does anyone know an alternative to dynamically loading components with componentFactory and componentFactoryResolver? 
solution: mlc-mlapis: Just another way to dynamically load a component (with a for loop in this case). 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: ericmartinezr: kinda lame to see the statistics, looks like a lot of ppl used fake accounts to first get a look at the questions. 

issue: @ghetolay thank you!! [<-CODE->] Why? 
solution: picosam: and I must say a very nice implementation by@ghetolayfor your problem ;-). 

issue: Hello there, do you know any good end to end testing software or framework for angular ? 
solution: 

issue: is that a preferred approach over [<-CODE->] or is it essentially the same 
solution: fugwenna: i prefer the double ngIf to the ngIf/else because the else shows up while data is loading. so you see a flash of 'no data here' sometimes on the loading. 

issue: concatMapis justmergeMapwith concurrency = 1 
solution: 

issue: philosophical Q: what makes a good team? 
solution: spaces all da way bro. 

issue: Whats the simplest chart package that everyone is useing for angular 4 
solution: but if i dont, i get an empty string on my <option>. 

issue: how can we tree shake unused component then ? 
solution: ghetolay: tree shaking works based on references.. 

issue: soLocation.subscribe()from@angular/commonreturns an "ISubscription" instead of a Subscription ... and it doesn\'t seem to respect unsubscribe() 
solution: I noticed it doesn't have pipe either / can't use a pattern likethis.location.pipe(takeUntil(this.destroyed$).subscribe( .... 

issue: I have an Angular CLI app w/ Bootstrap 4. Is there a way to change the theme at runtime?  I'm thinking not, but it's a requirement for my project. 
solution: Because of the nature of the compile time SASS variables, I would need two different builds in order to have two themes!  - Boss not happy with that!. 

issue: is angular 6 released on npm? 
solution: 

issue: I always cringe when I click the "I forgot my password" link and then get it in plain text in my email. 
solution: timothyblue: You may not like my website then... then again, it's a solo website, and building emails requires time I don't have. 

issue: anyone doing routing within an overriding ErrorHandler 
solution: timothyblue: just redirecting to an "oopsie woopsie" page on an angular error (non http). yeah I have not found, this is for "oh shit you broke it". 

issue: Is there a way to dynamically add scripts in component.ts? 
solution: 

issue: The observable solution sound like the way, because it's just cleaner otherwise you should do something in the ViewChecked loop but it would be really bad i think 
solution: Idk, i just feels that everytime i work on some project or feature NgRx is the only way to keep the code away from becoming a huge mess, i can't just think of a single scenario where i wouldn't use it. 

issue: how you doing kevin? 
solution: spa daynice. 

issue: ?? what's that object for ? 
solution: no i really want a nested form control…  not group. a control has a no nesting. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] Why this code it dosetn output each value of array? 
solution: This is why I like to idle in this room. I would not have thought that my simple question would lead toyou'r doing it all wrongbut per usual it did. Now I'm a little smarter. Thanks!. timothyblue: there\'s lots of "because" reasons. one main one is that nested subscribes don\'t (by default) propagate backpressure - if the outer observable is unsubscribed from, the inner one still won\'t be.. 

issue: If I have an observable that is pipedfirst()in and I subscribe to that, do I need to unsubscribe? 
solution: ghetolay: Wow, I've been doing it wrong all this time.. @timothyblueSo more observableishthat can be seen as a problem but yeah when you start observable you end up needing observables everywhere :). sarunint: just because it'll stop after first result still makes it async, so the subscribe callback can still be called after the component is destroyed. 

issue: I do this too, whats the correct way to do it? 
solution: 

issue: concatMapis pipeable in 5.5 correct? 
solution: timothyblue: from a more philosophical standpoint - Rx is designed to work best when subscriptions happen at the very edge of your application, as close to the UI as possible. Everything else should be set up as a chain ofObservables such that the data the UI needs gets requested and delivered when that subscription happens.. 

issue: is that the thing that lets you build your ownng gstuff with angular? 
solution: rohitsodhia: that's schematics ( so all), but they added some for creating a lib inside of your project. 

issue: is this the new answer for everything ? 
solution: someone makes a meme please :). because the answer will generally be "go DIY". 

issue: Uhmmm... it's working fine for me, unless I'm misunderstanding something 
solution: But not in my case....  [<-LINK->] reproduce the behavior there. yeah, I read the SO, but like I said, it's working fine for me. If I paste that value it changes it to 1234. 

issue: Q.One fo you use cli6rc in their project? what looks like yourloadChildren? 
solution: Yeah, his stackblitz is working fine, I dont want to use the NgControl. Rather I would like to use ngModelChange.... Can please answer on SO what you are suggesting using ngModelChange. 

issue: a component 
solution: fugwenna: i though with a loop. 

issue: you mean ex coworker? do it cut him loose 
solution: this is weird. 

issue: owlstack: OOM issue, google aorund there’s some fixes for it afaik, 6 is supposed to alleviate that? 
solution: google around it’s been a big deal for awhile now, some easy fixes…. 

issue: yes it is 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Who can help me? I want to output on view, a model for each make 
solution: alexandrupintilei: You'll have to expand on that... seems like you have all the code in place already?. 

issue: what's new 
solution: 

issue: I am. 
solution: 

issue: the question is: can I swap out the entire template at runtimethe answer is: nope 
solution: Toxicable: I thought so.. Toxicable: if possible, would you mind having a look at the dynamic component resolving service I implemented? ( [<-LINK->] ) It works with--prodas well; I'd just like to know if the injection-token technique I used is something I can rely on or if it is going to be deprecated /incompatible with the upcoming angular 6. 

issue: I'm noticing that(click)bindings require a double tap on mobile (testing w/ iOS)Is that normal? 
solution: fugwenna: I didn't. I usually build and deploy right to my device, never bothered with the viewer or WYSIWYG builder. 

issue: has it been a month? if yes, probably 
solution: ^^^^^^^^^ ahahaha. beautiful champ. I never bothered with Yarn so I guess I win. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Is there a better way to do this, to avoid mapping the empty value in the first place? 
solution: jplew: If you want to just remove undefined values from an array you can just check if its truthy or not.new array = array.filter((val) => val);;. 

issue: what do you mean by classes? 
solution: 

issue: is there any way to get the same instance of an HttpInterceptor for injection into other classes? 
solution: it should all be the same instance if i understand you correctly. assuming you’ve provided it high up enough in the tree… now if you have sibling components and the interceptor is provided in each component they won’t, but if it’s provided in the module it should be the same instance. hungerregnuh: i would think it would be that way too but no the HTTP_INTERCEPTORS are being provided with a separate instance even if i define it way up in the AppModule. 

issue: Hi everyone 
solution: but when I'm include that module to my project. sandangel: it will not work.. 

issue:   waddup folks trumpet lol 
solution: Then I could just buy a couple of rounds and become enlightened :-). 

issue: for what 
solution: 

issue: Hello, Can anyone point to to an article on how the changeDetectorRef is gets destroyed? 
solution: When does detach get called? I have something odd going on, and I know I am not the one calling detach. 

issue: Um is there a better way to do this: [<-LINK->] ? 
solution: owlstack: I would do a ngFor of the options with a custom orderby pipe. owlstack: *ngFor="let nationality of nationalities | myOrderPipe". 

issue: Hi here. Is this the good place to talk about the AngularCompilerPlugin ? 
solution: 

issue: hey, anyone know if there is a way to make batch http GET requests  using the HttpClient ? 
solution: getmicke: there is nothing provided, you have to do it yourself. 

issue: Is it possible to make a cookie observable? 
solution: simon2k: That would cause problems if a user tried to perform an admin action with noaccess_tokenbefore the setTimeout checked it. 

issue: is there a metadata file? 
solution: the rest is .umd, .map, .js and .d.ts. 

issue: What expression@amazonalexabot_twitter? 
solution: fugwenna: everytime I think I got those under control I get another one, so I just evaluate and "fix" as they come up. I have a text box that on enter displays a primeng dialog, that has a control in an ngif that peforms a service call and populates the result. 

issue: It's like texting on an old flip phone 
solution: well if you go by the error message it's saying the expression has changed after it was checked, so I take that to mean after CD has run the value changed. 

issue: btw 6.x - how long until the release? 
solution: I have no info but it should be close. simon2k: sooon. 

issue: hello - have you ever noticed that propagation of the BehaviourSubject works faster than pushing a new value through Input? - here's an example: [<-LINK->] (the console). I had a use case similar to this and ended up with passing a value through another BehaviorSubject to the child instead of passing it through Input 
solution: ghetolay: I have a behaviour subject that is updated at the same time when there is a new value in the input. The situation was similar as in the example - I had a subscription in which I was calculating value based on the value from the input and value from the Behaviour Subject. The value from the Input was delayed, therefore I couldn't make it working, so I ended up with moving the value that was passed through the input to another BehaviourSubject.. 

issue: @crookseythe structure requires to do it that way, but you can write it "cleaner" with map() and filter() 
solution: dklmuc: that code you gave runs, without error, however, it does not update values, any ideas? Quite hard to debug, but seems to be executing. 

issue: How can I use a Subject to queue up events for a certain duration of time, and when the duration of time is over, emit an array of the events to a second Observable? 
solution: dklmuc: My use case is that I have a FilterComponent which displays lists of [<field> <operator> <value>]. Depending on the selected field, the value can be a multiselected array. Some of the things that are selected can get deleted on the backend, so the component for this filters out values that are no longer options. When this happens, a change event is emitted. So I want to queue up all of the events that happen when the filter is loaded, and display some kind of warning about which expressions have been automatically filtered.. 

issue: Ya tooling just takes time to catch up 
solution: yeah i suck at rxjs. and according to@timothybluethis means i suck at life. which i might agree with. rxjs sucks the life out of you.... 

issue: :| I mean 
solution: you could also just provide a mock. lets say you have a template like [<-CODE->] then you just provide a component which uses that selector in your unit test. I personally wouldn't mock a third party thing. 

issue: hi guys how you guys control the components that needs the page to go up,  and the list component to maintain the scroll position? thanks in advance 
solution: ronnyek: yes that, sorry it wasnt that what i want.. i already do that, and i think is not a good approach, to add in each component that i want to scroll up, i was wondering if angular have another approach.. for example, i have a list of products, i scroll down to bottom to enter the last item , when i enter the item, my page is on the bottom of the details, i want since is a page details i wanted to enter and stay up to the top .. and then when i go back, there yes, since is a list of item, i would like to keep the scroll status.. 

issue: anyone here know how can we build a breadcrumb in angular ? 
solution: 

issue: hi guys, is there a way to execute a function for every itération in *ngFOR, i tried trackby feature but it's not accessing properties of the component(undifined) and it's not executed for every itération but exeuting multiple times and  don't know why 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] help me pls 
solution: i use primeng ultima, it happens on deployment. Check your path. i mean the ttf is there, and i double checked it. 

issue: how to get the hold of individual radio-button in a radio-group using querySelector? 
solution: ghetolay: I see you saying that like in 300, kicking some poor code down a deep well. 

issue: what's the body ? 
solution: If you check your network tab, does everything look good in the call? headers correct, body correct?. it is setting Content-Type as text/plain for some reason. 

issue: Hello! I am having an issue in production (Apache server) Namely, my login form reopens, and "?" gets appended to the URL... I managed to get rid of the "?" mark by putting some dreictives in .htaccess but still i can see "?" is being added when looked in console What is going on here? 
solution: Btw, I fixed it, it turned out that because I had the save() method call directly on form caused the page to reload. Havingevent.preventDefault()did not help. I found another approach -- move the method call from the form onto the button + change the button type fromsubmittobutton.. 

issue: Anyone here used ng-redux? 
solution: 

issue: does anyone happen to know node.js here? no one in nodejs channel answers my question... 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] any ideas why that wouldn’t work? 
solution: remove the%on the binding. nope… no go :(. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: how is the tree defined? 
solution: So you could do[style.padding-left]="(item.depth * 10) + \'px\'". I mean, you don't even need Angular for that, if they're nested inside each other it'll stack, right. 

issue: I'm confused about this syntax...why don't you have to subscribe to the observable? [<-CODE->] : ) 
solution: 

issue: hi guys, how can i reload the app again after changing the language, thanks in advance 
solution: 

issue: how to check network connection with angular? 
solution: i think doesnt exist nothing specific in angular. manvfx: services are singleton, inject it in your root component class and go ahead. 

issue: selectPart(event) {this.onSelectPart.emit(event);this.filterService.updateFilter('selectedPart', event);} anyone know how to give a color to this particular event 
solution: Use the event to set a class. 

issue: detailImageDatais notboolean, so Typescript doesn't let you do that because the comparison doesn't make any sense. 
solution: You probably mean "if it\'snullorundefined".. 

issue: Is there a way to use if-then-else but with "as variable" syntax?For example:<div *ngIf="(myObs$ | async) as foo; then templ1 else templ2"? The problem is: When I try to usefooinside these<ng-template>s, I cannot because it does not exist there 
solution: d3lm: Yeah, I realized in the meantime I don't gain anything with introducingthen. Basically, what I am trying to achieve is for example - user controls in the navbar. The scenario: When I wait for myuserObsto resolve, I want to have a spinning loader.. Then, depending on the success of that, to either display user controls (dropdown) or (if not logged in) the login link. 

issue: how this is related to aangularchat ? 
solution: 

issue: I was about to recommend the same: I get my endpoint in the configs, so it changes by environment 
solution: 

issue: oooh@robwormaldcurious, of the 600+ angular apps google has, how many would you guess use ngrx? 
solution: can't really give numbers :) with the exception of shopping express, all the projects misko mentioned use it. 

issue: please help memap chart no display no errors! [<-CODE->]  [<-LINK->] please help me 
solution: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-rwkuh4 -> iam getting error in this stackblitz, so i have shared related solution for that issue. In that issue some running project are there.. 

issue: me? 
solution: i had such high hopes. hungerregnuh: heeeeeeeeeeeeeeelp. 

issue: ghetolay: any idea how to make the inject template via<ng-content>to fill the parent div? 
solution: broweratcognitecdotcom: this is a good article but it does not say nothing about styling the content to fill the parent. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: broweratcognitecdotcom: I tried but gotng:///AppModule/AppComponent_Host.ngfactory.js:5 ERROR TypeError: websocketService.connect(...).map(...).share. 

issue: How's everyone? 
solution: this guy is telling us we're all going to get hacked. 

issue: hi - is it okay to ask noobish questions in here on why I'm not able to wait until animations finish before going to a new route? 
solution: well - i asked it on stackoverflow already ( [<-LINK->] , here it is) and I got an answer too but this just won't work. Using aCanDeactivateguard as suggested somehow does not trigger the animation at all ^^. 

issue: in what type of config file ? angular-cli.json ? 
solution: TwanoO67: you builg 2mn in a small project ?. this is a lot i have 1200 files in my project (relativly big project). this project: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: why not just use the select from material?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: The last time i try to implement it, i had problem displaying the selected flag icon. 

issue: why not emit and complete? nope 
solution: 

issue: Hey, anyone following the angular commit message format for their own projects? 
solution: 

issue: Has anyone tried importing JSON in typescript? 
solution: 

issue: I stopped atforkJoin==Promise.all, and walked away 
solution: 

issue: I'm struggling with typed arrays on typescript , anybody can help me ? [<-LINK->] 
solution: You should create an object of type credit policies and then you can add that to your files array. const files : CreditPolicies[] = new Array <CreditPolicies>(); const file = new CreditPolicies(this.details); files.push(file);. 

issue: checkedproperty does not exist ontransaction@raineer24 
solution: 

issue: wouldn’t that just retry once the http emits a value? hmmm nvm 
solution: looking at examples… the map goes before the retry, also wouldn’t your map be in the pipe also?. 

issue: I pasted the same code in my local machine  [<-CODE->] but it always get opened though I have setpanelOpenState: boolean = false;any idea. why?  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] 
solution: When I change the values, I got different results in your blitz. So either the behavior isn't what you think it is, or I'm not understanding what you're expecting.. 

issue: can someone help me with navigate  from module 's component to child module component  [<-LINK->] 
solution: ebriksmanish: you should have a deeper look at the docs, doingRouterModule.forRoot(...)in a child module is the first big mistake I see. ebriksmanish: I would suggest stop it, make a new small project just for route testing and play around with it... now you're defining/navwith a child/profilebut want to navigate to/profileat top level, you should really try to understand the basics of routing before implementation. 

issue: is your array supposed to contain json if not, take the quotes off of your keys 
solution: you usually just use json for serialization. 

issue: any help? 
solution: 

issue: see how some code can clear things up :) 
solution: but the real problem here is using a class. 

issue: Puppeteer? 
solution: GoNode5: would that work on travis + github or somewhere. lazarljubenovic: I only produce closed source for companies.... 

issue: provide the component? what does that have to do with route guards? 
solution: at least thats how I understand it. hmm not sure. 

issue: Anyone have a working packages.json for an angular 6 with rxjs 6 
solution: sliceofbytes:  [<-LINK->]. waiting on the cli now. The rxjs-compat is behind rxjs i think. that's a couple of weeks old, but it'll be something similar to that. 

issue: how about module? I can see that there is ngDoBootstrap 
solution: sliceofbytes: you should refactor to rxjs 6 and pipeable operator. I already did. 

issue: Do the polyfills work for IE11 for anyone? 
solution: 

issue: Morning friends :) 
solution: They had a lot of technical issues with the streaming.. 

issue: do you know why metadata is empty when building angular lib? 
solution: I used bazel too but the output is the same. I wouldnt think bazel vs just regular builds would vary the output all that much. 

issue: do they have a directive you can apply to an input? 
solution: I wouldnt think you'd actually be able to subscribe to it that many times. you can use an ngIf to create some kind of var. 

issue: any help? 
solution: 

issue: How do I expose anObservablein a child component to the parent component? 
solution: AlecTaylor: ...@Output()is the simplest way. Yeah I’ve got an event emitter working now. AlecTaylor: .. forchildtoparentit is usually enough.. aasmm7x: ... I think that standard*ngIfcan't understand that. 

issue: Yup, I know, but what is the benefit, instead of using the*ngIf? 
solution: Combine all the Observables beforehand.. If you really want to wait for all of them.. 

issue: Is it possible to bootstrap another angular application within the first one in the router outlet? 
solution: 

issue: they self-complete 
solution: Observables have 3 "signals"next - where they emit a value, zero, one, or many times \nerror - when there\'s an error, and this is terminal\ncomplete - when they\'re done.completing and erroring will both tear down any internal listeners [<-CODE->]. that won't self complete, but unsubscribing will call the returned function and clean up. 

issue: Anyone here got any experience with thecreateSelector/createFeatureSelectorfunctions of ngrx? 
solution: If I write a selector which takes a number, it works as expected, i.e. recalculates when the input number changes.. If I write a selector which takes a state object, it doesn't pick up on when I change a property in it.. 

issue: how many people you gonna share that url with today? 
solution: haha. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] no 
solution: dhrn: if you want a deep clone you can use [<-LINK->]. ndcunningham: are you using lodash?. i never used before. some one said lodash will increase the bundle size.. 

issue: So there is not a command or program for a desktop app which can do that ? 
solution: (no offence to those people ;D). well i dont know which group i should go to :D. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Was wondering does anyone know how to detect a browser close event? 
solution: was hoping I could use something likecanDeactivate(). 

issue: hey everyone, some1 here who can give me some support on an issue with cookies? 
solution: I don't know why the set-cookie is ignored by the client, and is there any workaround, aside from sending additional requests, and let the angular client set the cookies 'manually'. 

issue: anybody see my comment above about extendingUpgradeComponent?  if the directive you're upgrading depends on services, how do you handle those? 
solution: you'd just hve to giveMyUpgradeComponentthe same DI services as the parent, like you would any other child class. 

issue: Lol yugs already use bazel donno how u do! 
solution: probably becasue it ships with bazel config. 

issue: Now I'm curious, though, is there any way to only run class methods in the view once? 
solution: Or as mentioned you can do the transform before the data gets to the view (my preferred option). 

issue: Hello guys how its going ? :)Does somebody know how to change / rewrite  the text in the existing program  ? 
solution: Okey i will explain that i,m talking about programmed called Metatrader 4 , you can access the real data feed from the markets once you are registred with some broker , they provide you data feed to your accountThey give you account details , and once you log in into MT4 you are getting life feed for the currency pairs and other stuffYour name and account number appears on the top and in the terminal , I would like to change that for security reasons mostly so i can show my account to the clients without info beeing compromisedI used the chat engine to delete the mt4 memory and the change the name and account number which appears successfully but once I get connected to the server it change the name automaticly back. 

issue: Is something like this possible? [<-CODE->] 
solution: think you can use media queries in your css files to alter the height vs doing it in the template. 

issue: Can anyone answer my question here on SO? It is a directive problem [<-LINK->] 
solution: badcoder28: it's a js/dom issue. So you mean there is no way to write a directive that prevent user from entering non-numeric characters?. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] yeah this set of routes has multiple errors 
solution: yeah but you can only have 1 component per route in the router-outlet.. 

issue: do you people still us ids in your html it seems risky when everything is a component 
solution: you never really can be sure that someone won't introduce another component on your page and it could use the same id. 

issue: Pro-tip never do this@Output() change = new EventEmitter() Or rather, fail-tip 
solution: If you provide an output from a child component and name it change,  and emit from the child component, your parent component which listens to change like:<child-comp (change)="someCallback($event)></child-comp>"will get two events, 1 is yours, the other seems like some angular event or something. 

issue: When doing reactive forms, is it required to call updateValueAndValidity() ? Or am I doing something wrong? 
solution: broweratcognitecdotcom: ... it is necessary when you have for example conditionally related multi-fields validations .... 

issue: does anyone of you know the solution to this problem? I don't get it: [<-LINK->] 
solution: mlc-mlapis: It has to be... because it has to do with the interpolation. When I write hardecoded works in the table cells the width is set correctly.... GIihhjk_twitter: ... I meant just using pure JS to push the first row (the same content as now) to the empty table ... because it is the same as it is now in Angular app.. 

issue: Ya I'm getting dz bt my requirement was to get duration once we upload a file 
solution: Eric are you able to tell me what to pass as a document when defining a provider that requires document as a param ?. 

issue: Service: [<-CODE->] Component [<-CODE->] The Component and Service work fine when I first visit the route that the component is rendered on, but when i navigate away and then back, the service does not return the value 
solution: AdamJayne: I would look for two situations. That the service is provided more than once, ie. importing a shared module that provides it in multiple places. Second is an error. An observable ends operation on error.. 

issue: anyone else have problems with angular-cli's proxy not proxying body contents? 
solution: tommck: So like it sends the heads and stuff, but not the body when you make a request that goes through the cli proxy setup?. but the SAME call I made that was not proxied, the data all made it to the server fine.  Then, I added the proxy in... body is not there. 

issue: maybe? 
solution: 

issue: :o 
solution: 

issue: Afternoon all :) 
solution: It goes well. On a plane heading to Germany at the moment.. 

issue: nope 
solution: to trigger an@Outputyou must have access to the component.If oyu have access to the componenbt and the@Ouputis public then you're able to hit.emit()but that that point whats the value you get from doing thatYou already have some hook into when thats going to happen, why not do whatevr other action yourself?. Toxicable: That's a primeng component with an inbuilt upload button that triggers the uploadHandler event. I would like to control the upload with another button and I am trying to figure out a way to do this. 

issue: I think you'll need to recreate this on StackBlitz so we can see it. 
solution: xximjasonxx: it possibly means you have a crashed view, then you navigate.When a view crashes Angualr cant "unrender" it. 

issue: how can you get [(ngModel)] property name in a directive? 
solution: dang.  I got real close withthis.control = this.injector.get(NgControl);but still nothing grr. 

issue: How do I import modules into stackblitz? Is there an option for it? 
solution: 

issue:   morning folks 
solution: hungerregnuh: ...    and afternoon also!. hungerregnuh: ... still a bit early. hungerregnuh: ... if you look it like that, then it is right!. 

issue: hey guys CORS on an iframe would be the same as CORS on everything else yea? 
solution: the error is just:Failed: Error while waiting for Protractor to sync with the page: "both angularJS testability and angular testability are undefined.  This could be either because this is a non-angular page or because your test involves client-side navigation, which can interfere with Protractor\'s bootstrapping.  See http://git.io/v4gXM for details". 

issue: Time to resurrect this issue [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: i'd be less annoyed if i didn't keep speaking at MS conferences about Custom Elements in amicrosoftproduct. 

issue: what about async pipes in a table ? Like on ngrx I have my entityName pipe which just search an entity in the store and gives it's name. [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: (i'd just put that in a function, it really doesn't need to be a class) Java people, smdh 
solution: Combined with OnPush and this, I can avoid flattening my input data, and use a function to render the value, efficiently I hope.. 

issue: Can anyone tell me why angular isn't detecting that I changedarray? [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] I want the button to enable when my array is populated Maybe I'm missing something basic...? 
solution: <button mat-button disabled='array.length === 0'>Click me!</button>. this is why, fwiw, our template syntax is what it is, because with<div [attr.disabled]="someValue">or<div [disabled]="someValue">, the [] on the left hand side tell you (and angular) that the right hand side is an expression. 

issue: I need to tweak an npm dependency and then push my project to github so it works for others with this tweaked repo. What is the standard method for doing that? 
solution: iammikecohen: Yeah, that didn't seem right. What do you do in these situations? Do you fork, tweak, and build your own repo and then commit/publish the built bundle to it?. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] why its not splitting it into words? It should be like [I], [a,m]..... 
solution: yeah, my "? ..." was more like "how is it related to angular?". Yeah its not related to Angular but I kinda everyone would know this. 

issue: ? ... 
solution: 

issue: hmmmm was this why you were looking at all the date stuff in angular? 
solution: you can read like the first too paragraph. 

issue: a question about@angular/elements, when loading an element inside an angular application there seems to be an issue with Zonejs trying to load twice. what's the best way to handle that kind of problem? 
solution: if I use the element on a clean html file the elements will need to load zonejs to work properly. when on angular application it'll load it twice, at the moment I added my own check on the main.ts file to see if Zonejs exist or not and load it accordingly. 

issue: Is there a way to create a service (in background) without injecting it into a component? Also, without Injector? 
solution: 

issue: Is there any way to pull angular components dynamically like polymer do via import tag ? Angular Element doesn't look like has the capability to do the same. 
solution: 

issue: 1 for 2 
solution: 

issue: Can anyone help me figure out how to get my pull request unstuck? 
solution: You should reclone and update your pr. 

issue: BellerophonM: Use a different change detection strat on whats in the ngFors 
solution: is there a way to do that with just a single ngFor on a wider form, or do I need to wrap the select in a custom component?. 

issue: anyone have a migration guide to jump to 6? 
solution: 

issue: Ya I work in visual studio 
solution: Mainly because it was in place when I got at this job. 

issue: hmmm migrating now wonder how nutty this will be 
solution: 

issue: I'll update to next from rc hopefully that will be a no brainer I haven't used the flex-layout package is it worth it? 
solution: sliceofbytes: You could create a whole new app to be on the safe side. 

issue: Jealous, I'm still doing errors just updating from the last rc 
solution: 

issue: yay 6 aot build working 
solution: 

issue: my mismatch message is showing even i havnt completed my input of EMAIL validation  [<-LINK->] 
solution: coderishu: or check when your “validation” email field is not pristine. i’d use a reactive form to help with validation errors… otherwise you’ll need to keep track of when that cemail is touched. 

issue: Hmm. Not sure what is happening here. v6.0 [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] this is in the browser console 
solution: it's socket.io. Toxicable: you got any time for annoying universal questions?. phenomnomnominal: little busy at the moment sorrytomorrow or tonight?. 

issue: 3 .. 
solution: 

issue: See? Links to instructions are easy :D

issue: concatMap is just merge/flatMap with concurrency = 1 
solution: 

issue: hello All. I have a problem with upgrading angular2 to angular6. it is messy, is there a guide for it? 
solution: 

issue: hi all i have a simple rxjs question about Catch does catch 'catch' all errors in the stream? 
solution: 

issue: hi guys 
solution: hmm I am trying to build a geospatial data management system. I would like to enable a user to request for a map he wants from the administratr. 

issue: fire detectChanges yourself on specific events? 
solution: 

issue: is there a CLI cmd to generate a lazy loaded module? something like this, ng g m Auth --lazy --routing? 
solution: DanielNetzer: ... it depends ... you can always use a dummy route to create a separate junk and still load it programmatically and not by the router.. 

issue: That is true@abbadka. Do you think there's any performance difference from having my method and just puttingform.get(...).invalid || form.get(...).dirtyin the template itself? 
solution: 

issue: as? 
solution: 

issue: bluebaroncanada: it sounds like you don't want any navigation when they click on blog... so don't put a routerLink on it :D 
solution: sam-s4s: Then I don't get the active css on the word Blog.

issue: How can I add two functions from a dropdown?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: HI guys I am new in angular programming 
solution: I am building a project with angular and nodejs. I need now to use socket.io for real time purpose. 

issue:  [<-ISSUE->] i assume you’ve seen this? too slow pup 
solution: I don't really want to have to build a script per lib, we have heaps of them and they're all related. 

issue: hey is ng cli 1.6.3 latest or am i still behind ? 
solution: dammit. now that ive updated the specified command add is invalid. 

issue: Hi: I'm hoping for some quick advice on designing a REST API. I have two options. 1) Send my POST parameters in the URL, (?location=London&language=en), or 2) Send parameters in the body of the POST request, as mentioned here: [<-LINK->] . Is there any reason to prefer one over the over? 
solution: all I plan to send is text. You could send nested objects. You could also send a whole stream buffer, like an encoded binary. But that's just text too so would also fit in the URL. But I think the ease of use and flexibility argument is a good one. I wouldn't have to use Postman orcurlto post something, I can do it directly from the browser.. 

issue: Mmmmmm.  [<-LINK->] 
solution: alxhub: I don't see you tweet for a while. Toxicable: you look cool in AngularAir :)). 

issue: any ideas why none of these does not work: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: ahh just sorted out - was actually referencing the wrong control :) and yes the value -1 ;). 

issue: question -> How can i create a pre app bootstrap component? 
solution: that I wish to turn off at a certain point after checking if user is authenticated or not. 

issue: hungerregnuh: theres a reason why no one really uses their own decorators 
solution: It's not a spec yet, and the spec is changing, it's gonna break a whole bunch of apps when it does. 

issue: Morning everyone! 
solution: 

issue: hi anyone there to help , please?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: In that case my guess would be that there was some kind of exception thrown as thats one of the few possible "jumps" in the code. Did you explicitly check for exceptions?. (apart from that: You are aware that the code you posted looks like quite a dangerous way to check for a password? I wouldn't expect a client to ever compare usernames and passwords). 

issue: There is no subscribe for a promise 
solution: I mean are you available right now. and I would like to return some promises from such functions. 

issue: undefinedindicates it's never been setwhich dosen't make sense if you're retutning a value 
solution: Toxicable: : Right,undefinedis a default value when declaring variable and not setting its value.nulljust means that you explicitly set it to an empty value before returning. So what is the benefit? Why require to explicitly set it tonull?. Toxicable: undefinedis just value set by JS to an initialized variable. But you can perfectly useundefinedinstead ofnull. I still don't see benefits of limitingundefinedmeaning to uninitialized value and introducenullfor manually set empty value. Can you expand, please?. 

issue: what is the opposite of validators.required? 
solution: but for radio buttons which are required is not working if I do validators. required. 

issue: Define the order of the routes somewhere and assign a value to each one, then compare? 
solution: AdJesumPerMariam: this is what I came up with, really simple, probably hackable, idk lol. But this is the idea I had in mind [<-LINK->]. ericmartinezr: I didn't realize there was route.snapshot.paramMap.get, I think I can do what I need with that! I am so surprised this is so little searched for on stackoverflow, I barely see any topics and none with good answers. 

issue: Which API? 
solution: Generally,nullis a signal that something is explicitly disabled,undefinedis a signal that it was not specified.. 

issue: I'm having issues with myenvironmentfiles. Or maybe I'm just misunderstanding them. Doesenvironment.prod.tsappend/overwriteenvironment.tsor does it replace it? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: didn't even think about it, lol. I thought using host: {} was deprecated too. 

issue: no love for  5 or 6? 
solution: 

issue: Hi@arun-awnics 
solution: The classes "active" and "show" are hardcoded in your example, as you are not using the RouterOutlet I would suggest you toggle the casses with an (click) event in the <a> tag. Using (click)="tabActive = x" and [class.active]="tabActive==thisx). Using (click)="tabActive = x" and [class.show]="tabActive==thisx) hope it helps@arun-awnics. 

issue: One knows how I can initialize a Websocket and use it in multiple components and get it working in all browsers? As it seems right now it's not working in Edge en IE11 
solution: l3ijtKwijt: I only have experience with socket.io in angular using websocket protocol, with this library IE support has never been a problem to us. Is it possible for you to use such a library or do you want (or have to) implement an own solution for this?. 

issue: is there a way to create ng-host directive to represent the host component itself in its own template? 
solution: 

issue: Hi 
solution: but even before the data is received. the next thing starts to execute. 

issue: is anyone able to answer my question above :) ? 
solution: 

issue: there is no parent selector 
solution: just dive it an id or class like mat-select-wrapper. or you know angular. 

issue: how do I update the view when changing state value inside async callback? 
solution: when I modify the state value in a synchronous way I get the expected behaviour. 

issue: Hey folks, how would someone handle composing 6 different components into a single component? Actually, I should maybe ask how many components composed into a single component is too much? 
solution: Because we have a common pattern in our application that involves a data table and to support that data table are components like searching, filtering, sorting, pagination, etc... So instead of implementing the individual components on every page, the idea was to create a single component that composed all of those together.. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: probably wrap it in a nice class to expose methods likegetById(id: string)etc which would hide the impl details. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] :( 
solution: 

issue: avatar is cool, thumbnail, 1 or 2 letters from name, or icon fallback of user profile@DanielNetzer recently created that component 
solution: borriej: 1) If you can or want to resolve the dependencies of your SUT dependency, then you could directly provide OnboardingService and usespyOnthe methods that you care (see [<-LINK->] )2) If you cant or dont want to do the previous, then you need to provide a mocked object for theOnboardingServiceclass (see [<-LINK->] ). 

issue: I usually just doRouterModule.forChild(routes)and import routes fromsome-module.routing.tsin the same dir. Creating a whole new module just to stash the routing in it feels excessive imo 
solution: denisemauldin: If you do makesome-routing.module.ts, then yes, you’re going to have toimport {WhateverComponents} from “…”to use them in your route definitions (I assume you’re talking about ES6/typescript imports, not specifiying the components as declarations of the module or both modules) .  I was just saying that I avoid makingsome-routing.module.tsaltogether, and just useRouterModule.forChild(routes)directly insome.module.tswhereroutesis just exported from a file in the same directory. But I guess if you’re using the cli’s—routingfunction to generate the routing module then you’re avoiding the boilerplate I was talking about anyways, and you’re going to have toimportyour components in the file with the route definitions either way. So I guess just ignore what I said :) Also, try to find a way to use an IDE …. I run my backend in vagrant but I still develop and run the UI outside of vagrant… you can use a proxy config to forward your network requests to your backend in vagrant if thats whats blocking you. 

issue: you created the schema in an angular project? because the default tsling configuration will show multiple errors on the schema 
solution: 

issue: Are you using the CLI? 
solution: Actually meteor angular. Actually I've found a simple way to jnject the config. 

issue: How goes it in angular land today? 
solution: Hahahaha. It goes well :). Chrome stole my focus from iMessage, meant to tell my mom I love her, hahaha. But I love you guys too.. 

issue: wonder how long he was sitting there waiting to do that 
solution: if I cared as much as he did, I'd write a bot. 

issue:  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] 
solution: you finally posted something useful and not a gossip. big boy. 

issue: Ugh... lazy loading modules is so annoying... 
solution: 

issue: how can I run a function within that ? IE call HTTP service on ID change have not used map or switchMap before 
solution: 

issue: What are the possible ways to access and updatengModelvalue of the host from a directive? 
solution: 

issue: Having two directives which implement ControlValueAccessor on the same element will not work, will it@ghetolay? 
solution: and the custom one will win over the default. Yes, and it can be used for reactive forms too.. 

issue: how do i make that work inside of my map function? 
solution: RubyRonin: is that in angular? I doubt you use mongoose inside an angular project. and with var's. 

issue: Why is angular throwing  an error when I try to access something that's provided in the constructor in a different method? 
solution: that works, but it seems weird I have to store thehelpEmailin the class to pass it around. 

issue: So if  I have IconA that's used by 3 different modules, what do I do?  Make a module for that? So eventually I'll end up with a module for LazyA, LazyB, LazyC and then LazyAB, LazyAC, and LazyBC? 
solution: denisemauldin: you can make a module for LazyA, LazyB so forth. I have example on my git and I use a shared module for all the modules to use.. 

issue: i have 4 functions in my angular service ,,,how to know which function is called ?

solution: 

issue: it hates you :D 
solution: even though it builds fine. 

issue: any npm reference ?? for that ? 
solution: 

issue: anyone here? english? 
solution: But it would have been fun to attend that wedding. Where to find people interested in websockets, webRTC.?.

issue: How can I inject XhrFactory without importing a HttpClientModule? 
solution: mlc-mlapis: I have a component that uses XhrFactory. In this module, I also import HttpClientModule. Now I have to get rid of the import of the HttpClientModule. Because it breaks down the application. 

issue: Is this channel a good place to ask about ngUpgrade and angularjs/angular 5 integration? 
solution: can always try@BellerophonM. I probably need to try to wrestle this into a plunkr.

issue: are httpInterceptors not working with v6?  this guide to interceptors does not work, my interceptor is never hit: [<-LINK->] 
solution: CodeTropolis: that's wrapping http and is the way we used to do it until interceptors were brought back. 

issue: dammit dog… stay :D 
solution: Iknow...they always want to stuff to work right!. 

issue: besideag-gridsomebody have any suggestion of other powerful grid components? It could be commercial or free 
solution: borriej: I am looking more for a component more than a visual style, that out of the box come with filtering, ordered, posibility to inline edit.. where you hook the things to execute in each case. 

issue: anyone know of a good APP_INITIALIZER tutorial/doc's? 
solution: i think you just have to be careful with something likeRouterbecause it will throw circular dep errors. 

issue: you might be able to useng-template? 
solution: hrm. also lol I wish I could show you this timeline I’m building. it is so troll. 

issue: can you loop over keys in an enum 
solution: soenum.keysshould work. er. 

issue: very much so 
solution: make it a pipe, pipes by default are pure and cached by angular. irc… there’s a pipes package for angular to boost the caching further… don’t have a link handy though it’s on my home machine. 

issue: Something happened the network tab is going grazy crazy* 
solution: when I loaded it the first time, it started to download everything, like 1k requests. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] 
solution: it worked. no. 

issue: Can I use a non-angular theme or template as a landing page for an angular app? Basically I want to mix mpa with spa! 
solution: 

issue: this will render it as html? 
solution: you can’t interpolate html, angular sanitizes it. Ravslee: note@hungerregnuh. 

issue: I want to submit an issue to angular/schematics-angular-builds repo, create PR and contribute with the fix anybody knows about contributing to angular/schematics-angular-builds? only Angular Builds is commiting so I guess I'm not free to contribute 
solution: 

issue: oooh mr. rickabaugh got a min or two? 
solution: so i’ve done it successfuly a few times now and have been thinking, it’s a bit of a PITA to create a “…Service” to inject the templateref into the parent component. 

issue: So there will be no more updates for nodejs? 
solution: CodeTropolis:. 

issue: so are charting libraries just a library with some pre-designed charts you can use? 
solution: 

issue: Hey, can you somehow wait until (event)="doSomething()" finishes? I\'m trying to do modal with multiple actions and I\'d love to have something like <close-button (click)="doSomethingTakingLong()"> and close the modalafterthe action has completed 
solution: borriej: How can I subscribe to subscription? If there is aCloseButtonComponentwith@Output click = EventEmitter()and<button (click)="close.emit()">in a template and then I want to use it as<close-button (click)="save()">Save</>how can I access that (click) subscription? CloseButton needs to wait until save() completes before it will trigger close on its parent ModalComponent. 

issue: is that interface? 
solution: denisemauldin: you're trying to loop over an object?. It works... except that it's unordered. 

issue: can anyone help me? 
solution: and at html , i want handle if else bla bla. 

issue: is there a way to tell in javascript (hopefully chrome console too) if a variable is being passed by reference or not, so i can tell if i'm wasting a bunch of memory or not 
solution: i was just hoping there\'d by something where you could see something in the chrome console that indicates "this is a pointer to this location and actually does not occupy 854B of memory". 

issue: Should it work without the async pipe? 
solution: 

issue: oh... 
solution: 

issue: HttpClient uses XMLHttpRequest internally, right?

issue: Hey Mike, why does a texan have a badger as an icon? and where in Texas are you@jetstreamin? 
solution: 

issue: hi all, I have a question about Angular change detection and form groups if some kind people could enlighten me please? 
solution: I have written some wrapper components around different form groups that are part of a larger form group. for instance staff details might have a base with general details about the person, and we might have a nested formgroup about other details.. the problem is of course, the child component uses a nested form group's form controls, the validity of that changes, and then that status change propagates up to the parent form group. 

issue: what is generating the pop up? where's it coming from no, what point in your app is the dialog generated? 
solution: in there you can see "became a member". in mobile, when we press back, the dialog is not close.

solution: xavadu_twitter: ... the RED is the best.. mlc-mlapis: without doubt, I beat that the theme name is "Christmass tree". 

issue: what do i do if i have a resolver that needs to wait for the data from another resolver on a route? 
solution: jonschoning: is it a parent route. i dont think resolves go in order, do they.

issue: Can a child component instantiated through a router-outlet be styled by the parent component's css? 
solution: 

issue: o/ 
solution: 

issue: hi@kayvanbreewhat is the future of angular? Is angular framework is best for an enterprise application? because i use to go with an angular for next 8yrs minimum.. 
solution: vijayabaskarkgfsl: :@frederikprijckis right. Angular could be dead in 8 years. It could also be the single most used framework. Nobody can tell. What you CAN do is make sure to divide your applications in layers and components. That way porting your application to another framework will be easier.. 

issue: hey@CodeTropolis 
solution: sup'yo. then: create components on the fly!  ok, too far at this point ;). 

issue: Simple question though. Can a resolver reflect the name of the field it's resolving for? 
solution: vhdirk: i've created base classes for similar scenarios. 

issue: How can I test one particular component 
solution: I know I can run by test but it’s for whole app I guess I just want to run for one component. 

issue: I moved my component outside of the loop, and just use aselectedStockvariable to control it's view 
solution: brombomb: are you concerned about your apps initial load size at this point?. It's an interview test (I expected AngularJs [1], not angular 2+) I already turned in the assignment, but thought I'd go through the rest of the tasks just for practice. 

issue: is there a reason why I do not see many people using async/await with Angular ? 
solution: AdJesumPerMariam: When using Angular, you find yourself using observables over promises most of the time (mainly coz angular has some parts which use observables themselves). Async/Await doesn't realy work with Observables, so that's why you don't find it in Angular apps that often.. 

issue: got it. so the lesson is never ever have a subscribe within a subscribe ? 
solution: also, funny bit of info… if you have like take/takewhile etc.. in a pipeobs.pipe(take(…), otherObs))otherObs will keep running as the take will not go down stream. however, if you haveobs.pipe(otherObs, take(…))the take will unsubscribe from both obs and otherObs for you since it will go upstream :D. 

issue: do you have control over the data for questions and answers? 
solution: I have stored the correct answers for each question in an array.  Actually I need an array that have to store the answers I selected in the checkbox.. 

issue: So anyone using Bazel yet? 
solution: shush you :P. 

issue: mlc-mlapis: you want me give you motivation to have aot in dev ? seriously ? due perfs of course. browser refresh 4-5s while with aot instantly. Majority use aot in dev in small project (medium too) 
solution: 

issue: jason-candeo:  [<-LINK->] any reason for not using the decorator? 
solution: ericmartinezr: I am using angular flex layout, I am making my directive "responsive", got really tired of writing out@Input(\'<name>.xs\') set <name>()etc... Decided this might be a good chance to get into writing decorators and learning angular a bit better.. So I am making my ownMediaQueryInput(name still being determined). 

issue: material also has a date picker if you’re going down that design path 
solution:  [<-LINK->] never used the clarity stuff so can’t really comment on it aside from i know it exists. 

issue: what's your score? 
solution: It says expert. but I don't think I am. 

issue: Can anyone recommend a date and time range picker for either angular or Bootstrap? Has to have a selection of two date-times in a single picker? 
solution: 

issue: is there a way to automatically add components to the app module without always adding them manually? 
solution: CodeTropolis: because am use to working in visual studio and its easy and quicker for me to just add a file and component. 

issue: I gotta say I've yet to find a case where I actually want resolver 
solution: it managed to leave web apps with a very clunky delay that I'd rather turn into a very responsive page load, and a loading indicator. 

issue: .d.ts transformers are in there too! 
solution: alxhub: I don't see that. It's not in the blog post, because it's not really a feature that 99% of people would care about.. But it makes my life way easier.. 

issue: I just start building, and research best practices as I go 
solution: and idle here and try and learn / help with problems people have. 

issue: Hey Everyone! does anyone know why this isn\'t working?*ngIf="cardFormGroup.controls[\'card\'].invalid" thanks in advance 
solution: cardFormGroup = new FormGroup({card: new FormControl('', this.detectCardType),first: new FormControl('', Validators.required),last: new FormControl('', Validators.required),expiration: new FormControl('', Validators.required),cvc: new FormControl('', Validators.required)}). 

issue: Does anyone using CORS for API route? 
solution: mlc-mlapis: I have tried to configure IIS and found URL Rewrite issue, so that is why i have think about managing it from client side. 

issue: which error isn’t firing? do you have validators on that form control? paste some code for the formGroup 
solution: card: new FormControl('', [this.detectCardType, Validators.required]),. last: new FormControl('', Validators.required),. 

issue: How much code coverage should be for one component in unit testing ? ?? 
solution: 

issue: I moved my api to be served over https, and now my angular calls all fail withXHR failed loading: OPTIONS, calls to the api with postman still work fine, do I need to do something on the browser side, or do I need something in my angular code to enable https calls? do I maybe need my own localhost certificate? 
solution: 

issue: ?? i haven't explained what i do i just said each business has its own needs that need to be deployed separately 
solution: You said that the teams like 100~. I don't know how anyone could make something micro sized with a team that large. there are different platforms which are conglomerates of several agile teams. 

issue: I'm interested in how you keep the application payload small 
solution: That was my first thought. ship all of react + 4 different versions of angular lol. 

issue: How is this related with Angular? 
solution: It's so generic your question. Please go to stackoverflow and share your use case.. erasad22: then please go to the related websites for help this is not related at all with this room.. 

issue: is the package you’re using public? 
solution: hungerregnuh: yeah. make a stack blitz if you can :D. 

issue: here's mine [<-LINK->] 
solution: ghetolay: ... hmm, if you runthis._changeDetectorRef.markForCheck();inside fromDynamiccomponent then it works. ... but I can't see whythis.cmpRef.changeDetectorRef.markForCheck();from the parent shouldn't be the same also.. 

issue: Hi Guys I want to unit test the angular app Anyone have ideas? 
solution: I have a component which have method to connect with service class. getNames is my service class method to connect with api using http.get and return the results. 

issue: Morning all, a question. How do you populate a form in the template from an observable? 
solution: 

issue: sure, but whats wrong with microsoft owning it? 
solution: also it'll probably just operating as usual as with more acqusitions. I converted someone whos been working on embedded C (and using VIM) for the last 30 years or so to use VSC. 

issue: oh my 
solution: 

issue: what about typescript? 
solution: 

issue: what is equivalent for 'alt key' like this 'event.ctrlKey'? 
solution: this.route.snapshot.params['yourRouteParam']where route is ActivatedRoute is how i usually do it. actually from this also I am getting empty params, while in other places I am able to easily get the params.is it something that app.component load before than this getting action ( just asking  not much idea ). 

issue: whats made ya move away from github? 
solution: 

issue: o/ 
solution: 

issue: Hi Team, [<-LINK->] Anyone can help me out to solve this issue? 
solution: 

issue: here: , is there a way to show an "empty" template forngFor.. Or do you have to combine thengIf with the *ngFor? 
solution: also you cant combine 2 directives on a single element. 

issue: Angular5 not supporting IE9? 
solution: sahilkatia: you need to uncomment some stuff in the polyfills. aka all of it. 

issue: angular makes no assumptions about your app, so if its simple ngrx is blatantly overkill, along with onPush 
solution: I'd say if you arent working up trying to wrap some complex component up in an angular component. 

issue: hey hey 
solution: hahah. i am fug dog. I liked that layout anyway. wtf is that lol. 

issue: hungerregnuh: chases@fugwennawith a pitch fork and lol is that lxxs? or whatever 
solution: also thought windows made ssh/openssl install by default w/o lxxs. hungerregnuh: throws fug at ereck. actually looks like yeah ssh is avail on powershell. 

issue: what's the correct way to build form validators now that rely on 2+ fields?  I'm following some online examples and they seem outdated/not working [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: control.get('confirmPassword').setErrors( {MatchPassword: true} );set's the error on the confirmPassword field,return {MatchPassword: true};sets the error on the password group (not the password control inside the password group). I'd prefer the latter, but I guess both can work. 

issue: is this command is working ? npm cache clean --force ? 
solution: 

issue: Good morning all! 
solution: mine was like that for awhile, no joke, i was just regurgitating/paraphrasing angular.io, nrwl.io, protractor…. you get the idea, then immediately i’d have a link to all of those sites. 

issue: morning folks you’ve got the channel wave all wrong… it’s magic fingers 
solution: they’ll be in in about 30 mins or so, i think fug is an hour ahead of me.

solution: yep i was down in houston last week… 90* i wanted to die :D. 

issue: still necessary with fhir ? 
solution: yeah unfortunately. fhir adoption isn’t widespread enough and feels like a supplement for now. you in healthcare too gheto?. gheto I don't know but me I'm into radiology healthcare yes. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] it's working 
solution: ghetolay: yeah, but you're not using the get method, which i need. 

issue: are they still doing tiff for DICOM? 
solution: aaah gotcha… i remember DICOM being brutal to work w/ but, nothing different from the rest of the healthcare crap. 

issue: Hi all, Can anyone tell me how to use server side pagination, sorting and search with angular 4+ . thanks 
solution: sam-s4s: you are correct, but when the table is showing data from multiple tables, it's harder to manage.. ie. the way we have ours running is that you have a URL call that runs a stored procedure, that returns a JSON array - which is just selected as a query (with joins as necessary). 

issue: Hey folks, if I want to run some code after an input value changes, what lifecycle hook should I listen to? 
solution: I try to avoid binding inputs/outputs to getter/setters. 

issue: in other newsif anyone knows any JS devs in Auckland NZ, we're looking for one for my team 
solution: i think everyone and their mothers are "js devs" now. are you controlling rockets with js. 

issue: now now kids… do i need to separate you two? 
solution: I want to loop through the variable amount of children fields in the view. 

issue: those are the children of smz smith? 
solution: you should almost certainly store those as a new collection on the person record. 

issue: can you open [<-LINK->] website, open the console and write : moment.tz.guess() there. what is output? :) 
solution: 

issue: What would you recommend then how should I solve this? I was just trying to solve any how so I put <Dependents> the path is wrong only in stack blitz Let me know what should I do there @ 
solution: Yes, you can declare each attribute as optional by adding?at the end of each key that is optional. Otherwise you have to add the required attributes. Idk what you mean by no luck, but this issue could exist to all interfaces in your entire app, and the same solutions will be required (or using another interface). 

issue: what's funny about inclusion? 
solution: We're mobbing on it now, fixing up window uses etc. aim is end on month to get SEO all sorted and then remove touch.trademe.co.nz. 

issue: morning... broken spirit hand? 
solution: @rafaelbitenYep saw that, and afaik, I’m following the docs on everythingcomponents one and two extends the same base so that I can use that as a selector for @ContentChildren. you can't use a token inside Content/ViewChildren, I think there is even an issue that says it's a bug that it works. 

issue: workerlets! 
solution: fucntion( userDependent : dependent) { .....}. 

issue: flex box letting me down 
solution: I really like cssgrid, but I feel like there are a whole host of things it CANT do. I htink the thing closest to what I want is display: table. 

issue: Is it possible to animate the reordering of a list with@angular/animations ? 
solution: I tried to find a nice angular solution for filtering, not sorting. I didn't find one either and didn't want to include Shuffle.js or its alternatives, so I just stopped looking for it :S. 

issue: transform them into same format and compare not angular related 
solution: lazarljubenovic: I am looking for that.shall I usedatePipe?. no, date pipe is for formatting. not for comparing. use date-fns or sth. 

issue: N 
solution: 

issue: i am working on wondering why i chose this profession 
solution: and then probably fixing the backlog of bugs ive been pretending doesnt exist. i’ll trade you i’m doing HL7. and contemplating why the team here decided to roll their own i18n vs using the native angular one or ngx-translate. you’re probably sending down an object instead of a date. 

issue: what about theheavy computation? won’t it happen twice? 
solution: No, because the parent provides the service, so there's only one instance of it.. It's actually one of the patterns that I cover in that talk I linked.. Parent <-> child communication through a shared service in the view.. 

issue: +1 
solution: 

issue: What's up, friends? 
solution: 

issue: Hey folks, on a ng-container, can I not have both anngIf andngTemplateOutlet? I essentially want to show another template reference if a condition is met. 
solution: I\'m getting the error:Can\'t have multiple template bindings on one element. Use only one attribute named \'template\' or prefixed with * ("late let-row="row" vdl-datatable-cell-template #compountIdTemplate>. 

issue: use ngClass to dynamically add the class if it meets a condition, condition being matching the route you want it on 
solution: Wahtdb_twitter:  [<-LINK->] here's how to use ngClass. it doesnt quite answer your question because i just did simple events of click, mouseenter, mouseleave. but same concept applies. just have it look at current route, and make it either true or false if you are at the route or not. you probably want the isMain() call to be done in component, and have the result assigned to a variable which you have ngClass look at. because your way will fire the function on every change detection cycle (often). 

issue: Morning guys, I have a question regarding logout functionality. assuming a user logs out on a page that he can't be in it unauthorized. how do you handle that? 
solution: more sophisticated method would be to take user back only as far as needed. for example the user cannot see/foo/bar/:idbut can see/foo.. 

issue: what about the googles 
solution: 

issue: is it in your index.html? 
solution: No. I checked. you can either turn on sourcemaps in CLI or turn them off in your devtools or just live with it. 

issue: TestBed is used when we inject services ? Right? But in my case I’m using filter 
solution: 

issue: service? 
solution: 

issue: anyone know much about QueryList / ViewChildren? 
solution: if I've got an interface that these components implement, dont suppose I should be able to do@ViewChildren(SomeInterface) and get my dynamic components. 

issue: Check these issues in case there's anything useful [<-LINK->] 
solution: SO yeah, I’d love to be able to give you more context but all i have is red lines and a popover that displays that single message. 

issue: I should write a book about d3 and Angular, oh if I had the time... 
solution: steveblue: Man if we all had more time haha. 

issue: a service?  [<-LINK->]  [<-ISSUE->] ? not sure, is it related to your case? 
solution: hmmm…set-cookie: JSESSIONID=asdf; Path=...; HttpOnly. 

issue: Is this channel for versions including angular 6.x ? 
solution: I know that I dependency inject (DI) a service into the component in order to consume it. I would like a better understanding of the hows and whys behind DI.  I know part of the reason is testing.. 

issue: did you log what u get by filtering the array? 
solution: sagat_gitlab: Will you please help me on prefill array issues why i am not able to push the val;ues in it. 

issue: Would you pay for this one [<-LINK->] ? 
solution: don’t you mean lolSQL?. meow meow i can haz id frum tbl?. 

issue: :O 
solution: 

issue: as in: read the value? 
solution: I thought hostbinding would work. that's a write not a read. lame. 

issue: SO looks so nice :O 
solution: lazarljubenovic: cause they added a side bar ?.  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: it's string based 
solution: (which is basically the same thing). 

issue: Hello guy how do you specify initial focus on a button in a form? 
solution: one original and@fugwennathe fake one. or a custom directive since that wont work in 99% of usecases in a SPA. 

issue: are you logging in with google auth? 
solution: you need to add a redirect uri. where the redirect uri is your desired location (of your app). you want to get rid of the redirect all together?. 

issue: Where can I define CSP in a cli-generated angular app? Have some issue with frame-ancestors when IdentityServer injects a iframe 
solution: 

issue: dawg 
solution: hungerregnuh:. 

issue: Using the old http? 
solution: i guess you commented on this [<-ISSUE->]. I can't say buddy, I didn't even know iframes had that attribute. 

issue: What's the best way to reduce the size of a<mat-checkbox>? The standard size is way too large for where I want to place one. 
solution: I've tried to just domat-checkbox { width: 20px; height:20px;}and it does nothing. I did find something to set on a class.mat-checkbox-inner-containerbut that goes into the internals of the element and that doesn't feel right.. 

issue: i have a web app that contains a table that is populated from an API.  in order to have that data you have to be logged in to the server.  any ideas on how to ensure its logged in first prior to loading ? 
solution: oflores2313: Id use a route-guard, you shouldn't let the user even get to the route if they are not authenticated.. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] isnt this correct ? why is it giving error ? 
solution: That happens when you don't provide Http. i have provided it in constructor of subscriptioncomponent class. 

issue: Toxicable: yep, in one project 
solution: 

issue: regretted it immediately ? 
solution: gasp!. although, there are a couple of legit reasons, they're very very few. well without a case hard to say. 

issue:  [<-LINK->]  [<-CODE->] @nomssthat's what you asking for? 
solution: Not getting any map, but an error on console. Can you send the edit link?. 

issue: result selectors were removed in rxjs6 weren’t they? 
solution: hungerregnuh: this was always one of my favorite pieces of internet humor: [<-LINK->]. alxhub: that’s a long article i’ll have to read it later… i’m in the middle of sinning against all the programming gods out there :D Lol. 

issue: you want access to the instance ofsome3rdPartyDirectivefrom another directive? 
solution: well you could use it as a binding. some others might know a better way to do it, but a "straight forward" approach would be to have your directive accept the 3rd party instance as anInput, access it withViewChildfrom the parent and give the directive the instance... which might be goofy. 

issue: anyone?  child components, setters and behavior subjects? 
solution: :-) .  I have set up a component that has a child component that takes a group of usersNames as an array.  When a function runs, I want to pass a different set of users to the target child component.. I was using a behavior subject as the target of the input  for the child component.  But when a new child was the target, the all the components would change to the new data.  I assumed because they were all listening for the same input and they had a subscriptions.. 

issue: Hi folks, I am getting error message and it says: [<-CODE->] I do not understand what is the error Any Idea? 
solution: 

issue: :O 
solution: 

issue: Hey anyone out there who can help me with some performance problems when using too much http requests? 
solution: 

issue: kyler: .johnson1_gitlab  did you run npm uninstall -g@angular/cli first before installing the lower version . It seems your global installation still exists. Or delete it in your global npm folder manually if somehow  that command is not working for you. 
solution: Or delete it in your global npm folder manually if somehow that command is not working for you.. 

issue: Can IredirectToand still provide route data? 
solution: @HostListener('documentthis is still the most stupid syntax in angular ever. 

issue: hey, what will cause a service to be undefined in ng build --prod? 
solution:  [<-LINK->] it certainly exists and i dont see a reason why it would fail. 

issue: whoa what 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] I have created a stackblitz with this sample:https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-thj13j-kdf8d5 
solution: hobojoe: You can create a service that you inject into both. Give the service a Subject or BehaviorSubject. In the CustomerComponent, where you call this.activatedRoute.params.subscribe, in the handler, call this.theService.theSubject.next(theValue). subscribe to this.theService.theSubject in CustomerListcomponent.. @hobojoe You can create a service that you inject into both. Give the service a Subject or BehaviorSubject. In the CustomerComponent, where you call this.activatedRoute.params.subscribe, in the handler, call this.theService.theSubject.next(theValue). subscribe to this.theService.theSubject in CustomerListcomponent.Thats what I initially thought about doing. I would like to know if there was a different way to do it. But thanks a lot @broweratcognitecdotcom !. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] The error is in the browser: [<-CODE->] 
solution: After I install@angular/elementsI get error from the build(serve).

solution: 

issue: Any one have solution to copy "etag" custom header from reponse  after a get query ?  HttpClient is removing most of hearders , but i can see all headers present in netwok tab of chrome 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: While executing some tests are being skipped I don’t know why. 

issue: Remove them from your config? 
solution: hmm this is weird we went back to an older version of our code (prior to angular 6) and it works fine.. the site in IIS is not changed. 

issue: Angular 2 questions here? 
solution: 

issue: I mean angular's docs are built in angular. You can always go see how they built it 
solution: 

issue: Morning, does anybody have any ideas on how to debug the compiler within the chrome browser. I am hitting an error, know the line of code that causes it, but cannot find out why, as the error message is not related to it 
solution: yeah, it is complaining about the followingUncaught Error: Can\'t construct a query for the property "formHost" of "ParentDynamicFormComponent" since the query selector wasn\'t defined.but the actual issue is when I try and create a new class in a service that is called from with the component.. 

issue: how aboutng add @angular/hmr ^^ 
solution: mlc-mlapis: yupyup. 

issue: do you have a proxy? 
solution: 

issue: hmm, is that we are seeing i18n is rewritten now? I hope we could have HMR full support in angular currently it does not work well 
solution: when they try react / vue, they see the get started app hot reloaded nicely. 

issue: Right.. and you don't get any cache in Private Browsing, right? Or rather, the browser doesn't cache 
solution: That must be it, but I don't know why that would literally change the type of an Observable in my code.... 

issue: someone fix my java ssl handshake errors 
solution: 

issue: I am here too 
solution: 

issue: can anyone guide me to a room where i can ask a question about form validation? 
solution: 

issue: What is the best way to wait for all api calls to complete before loading my template? 
solution: 

issue: what version of rxjs are you on? 
solution: 

issue: Hello.. Does the base element in html influences the angular services? 
solution: alxhub: I have a duplicated entry because, angular is setting base url appending whatever is in base tag and i made an interceptor because i want my api in a subdiretory location.. But If I don't add that in the variables it doesn't add to the endpoint. I wanthttp://server/angularpp/base/to get the javascript but i wantAPI_URL/api/methodto the service. 

issue: I'm having such a hard time with observables, promises, map anyone have some time for me? 
solution: my second example is very similar...lets say I have a method that opens a dialog and I want to make 4 http.get requests to use data in that dialog.  The html fires off before I actually have the data and my console throws errors about undefined.  They eventually come in once the requests have been complete but what is the proper way have a loading indicator until all data has been retrieved?. 

issue: Is it an array type or a custom object type? 
solution: It should have a problem with the concat.  What i am more worried about is that you then iterate over the array in your previous function and assume that every object has a “fileformat” property when they don’t. 

issue: wat is dis bafcd18fd4d2e227fa82333ea8aacca1L40 lel  [<-LINK->] * 
solution:  [<-LINK->] there it is, it looks better. 

issue: hello hello  [<-LINK->] check the title of the chan 
solution: fugwenna: stands atop mountain waving flag. yeah i walked down to IT and logged onto the public network and its all fine. 

issue: So its mostly this?: [<-CODE->] 
solution: I believe its becausethis.statusesis re-assigned, thus during the network requests its "nothing", thus goes blank. 

issue: Is it possible to use multiple angular elements (angular 6 Elements) on the same page? Currently NgZone issue. 
solution: Toxicable: Meaning, exclude polyfills from each build? And have 1 polyfill in index tag?. @ToxicableIm guessing something along the lines of:if (!window['Zone']) {    System.import('zone.js/dist/zone');  // Included with Angular CLI.}Thanks for the guidance! Will just google and mess around now.. 

issue: import {MyComponent} from 'node_modules/stencil-poc-ng/dist' wat 
solution: 

issue: I don't understand how that would update the route@ronnyekcan you explain further? 
solution: likewise you can make navigation work that way with routerLink and router.go programatically as well. 

issue: How to import a sass file without using styleUrls ? 
solution: gvonhagel: I want to import it from js file.. fmoutawe_gitlab: I suppose you could use the default Nodefslibrary to read the contents of your scss file and load them into memory?. 

issue: is d3 with angular, a good combination ? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] ``` anyone doing this? 
solution: you want to render the title once. 

issue: if you're emitting different values why do you expect x and y to be the same ??? 
solution: 

issue: again I don't have any experience with it myself, just what i've heard from talking with people who do use these tools.All the stuff I make is totally internal so we don't care about things like bundle size / pwa / etc 
solution: 

issue: the prod build is done via cli after an export of the stackblitz ? 
solution: bobslaede: have no idea, and no time to build it myself atm. 

issue: Same behaviour on other browsers? 
solution: firefox and chrome loads it properly. is there a way to fix this ?. 

issue: ?? 
solution: 

issue: more community support now for NS? 
solution: I guess fi you are building ios/android you could probably build it once. 

issue: add the 'my-component' to the declarations array 
solution: I have added MyComponent to the declarations array too. that import statement looks strange. 

issue: preaching to the choir man 
solution: hungerregnuh: @ronnyekhave either of you done much with angular and firebase?. namely, angularFire2. 

issue: is there a documented way for using a library within a library. trying to get the paths in tsconfig right and I can get it working for dev, but ng build chokes 
solution: 

issue: How do I conditionally apply the presence of an html attribute in angular 5 I've completely forgotten how 
solution: but I am pretty certain that wont work if you are trying to conditionally apply a directive to an element. That will always put it on and set it equal to the return of some condition. 

issue: like libs ? 
solution: kind of what the env files is doing on dev and prod build. i want an embedded build and tester build functions that will use different imports. 

issue: all: how to used one component multiple times? 
solution: akshay-bhavsar: ... reusing a component is one of the building stones of Angular. Not exactly sure what you mean but in templates it is like<mycustomcomponent [inputbinding]="..." (myoutputbinding)="..."></mycustomcomponent>in any template and as many times as you want.. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] component A template: [<-CODE->] anyone ? 
solution: fugwenna: meh I don't think that's gonna work for me, at least it doesn't seem so. 

issue: dynamic... 
solution: I think you can accept one if you want to walk the property tree with reflection but it requires the unsafe keyword right.  I can’t remember its been a while. I have a feeling it wouldn't work since the execution of most functions would be too low to be able to accurately measure in a performance and reliable way. @babeal Yeah I mean it's probably do able, but you know it's dodgy and probably super slow.Totally not a 1st class citizen like it is in JSNot trying to start a language flame war, just an interesting difference between them. 

issue: hello all,is it possible to upload files with JSON data in the same request? 
solution: 

issue: And why users[0] ? 
solution: 

issue: how is it almost lunch already what is happening 
solution: 

issue: Why is this not smart ? I mean, if you've a model with a fullname method for example ? 
solution: but its going through change detection loops. so if you format things that way, and first or last name changes it probably should be re-called again anyway. 

issue: where is toaster.error coming from in the test? I don't see it defined anywhere

issue: Does any of the Angular gurus know if it is possible to update a dependency without having to rebuild, I am building a platform where there are many modules (or features) that are Angular libraries, I am looking for a way that these modules can be deployed indipendently of the main application shell, is this possible? 
solution: can this be done in production as well, so lets say I have the mainAppand modules calledAdminandProfilewhich are completely independent of each other and have two different teams working on them.  Lets now say that the team working onProfilemodule has finished some changes and wants to publish these changes…would these simply be published to NPM and then HMR will pick these up?.

solution: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/historyThere is no way to clear the session history or to disable the back/forward navigation from unprivileged code. The closest available solution is the location.replace() method, which replaces the current item of the session history with the provided URL..

issue: mlc-mlapis: @p1729can you show how it's done? When I see it once on a concrete example I can work with it, but raw documentation is hard 
solution: dalu: ... ^^^ is a good simple example. Invest some time to play with it and understand ... it is the only way. The nested subscriptions are the way to the hell. There are serious problems with passing completed and errors emits.. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] the repo from the tutorial 
solution: ericmartinezr: I shouldnt use the tutorial repo. If you can't follow a video tutorial, you should follow the repo. 

issue: how can i pass todo in  [dragData]? [<-CODE->] 
solution: if it's an object, then you're passing it correctly. it's a bit weird that you havlet todo of todothough. 

issue: most of you are probably watching the finals (so am I)is there a way to simplify this? [<-CODE->]

solution: also, the validation is not propagating like it's supposed to based on Kara Erickson's angularconnect 2017 talk. 

issue: got error again  [<-LINK->] I dont understand the error 
solution: Plautus123_twitter: In general, the error message happens when you try to create a template variable referencing a directive/component that hasn\'t been exported. Essentially,#myVar="ngForm"asks the host element if there\'s a component/directive exported as "ngForm" on that element, and if so, get a reference to it and set the variable myVar to that. In your case, the NgForm directive has not been applied to that element so there\'s nothing exported as ngForm on it. This will happen if you haven\'t imported the FormsModule.. 

issue: Borzilov: to achieve what? 
solution: Toxicable: I have an Angular sample app at stackblitz ( [<-LINK->] ) where i'm reproducing a change detection error from my real application. I have a list of QuestionComponents in the app. Items are successfully rendered (Initialized, Checked ...) in the AppComponent initialization, but i'm getting ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError when i try do add a new QuestionComponent in the list. Another specific thing is that the error just shows up if the initialContent property is set to '', undefined or null. If the value of this property is something different, the error does not shows up.I discovered some workarounds, but what i really want to know is a kind of deep explanation about the behavior. (A change detection explanation maybe). Thanks!. 

issue: seem like It’s not feasible 
solution: Toxicable: since probably you are the most knowledge about this, in the universal starter there is a pattern to exclude node_modules from being bundled [<-LINK->] , however the comment stats the opposite which one should be the right one? Also, shouldn't the main.bundle.js be excluded from bundling in webpack.server?. alan-agius4: we're actually planning on removing the webpack config from that when I get some time next.

issue: what 
solution: 

issue: El.getAttribute Whats taht ? 
solution: I don't think it's that new and I think this particular issue would be the same with ngRX. I agree with the author that ngrx is too direct a port of redux for React (I know it's not strictly for react, but basically it is). It would be nice if templates had something like a haskellwhere clausewhere variables participating in the template could be defined [<-CODE->]. 

issue: yep… that’s what the chans for 
solution: 

issue: merge the forkjoin and the auth service ? 
solution: and first return the  authService.authStream$. there are inside a large chain. like, listen to route params... 

issue:  [<-LINK->] are you trying to do something like that? repace subject with behavior subject 
solution:

issue: guys how do you build projects? 
solution: and added a subfolder in my index.html base href. 

issue: Maybe I'm doing this httpClient.get<TEMPLATE>(url) wrong.  Does the TEMPLATE need to be an interface?  Can it be a class? 
solution: Yeah, I still can't get my .get() to work.  What I'm getting back is an object and NOT the templated class.. sbreed: ...httpClient.get<INTERFACE>(url)... it is just for TS typing .... 

issue: with css ericmartinezr: you can read more about this new tech in [<-LINK->]

issue: +1

solution: 

issue: is the form component a template/reactive form? if so you need to use CVA 
solution: I can provide any information you need, because I want to do the Angular better :). a stackblitz example would help, but why are they two different routes? it seems theres a dependency going on here. 

issue: Can I add additional css based on ngIF ? 
solution: Like if scroll height is less than 150 position fixed, color ... margin ... 

issue: Do you mean like<button [attr.buttonType]="...">? Or you mean a set of attribute names determined at runtime? A langClass? 
solution: I am trying to put together button documentation, but between 3 types of buttons, each in two sizes, with four named color settings, and the ability to disable all of them, I need to step through a huge set of permutations.. All that is controlled by adding an attribute to the button<button big>etc.. Manually typing out all the permutations will really suck.  If only there was some kind of machine that could do rapid calculations and symbol manipulation for me..... 

issue: navbar is a separate component?

solution: 

issue: how i can fixed gps current location for deploy url ? in angular 5 
solution: broweratcognitecdotcom: ooooh yaar agm completely work but only error generate in safari and deploy url. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Is this the proper way to do this now? 
solution: so it\'ll still kill my "tap" when it fires?. hmmmm... so I still have to subscribe in the end or my observable is cold. 

issue: don't subscribe (async pipe does that for you), just .pipe(map(...)) to transform 
solution: the piped async value in the template are all blank. yeah, that looks better. But also get rid of  the other subscribe (and Subject). 

issue: What version of angular are you on? 
solution: xAirx: here's an example using FormData [<-LINK->]. xAirx: To piggyback off@ToxicableI think you need to subscribe your post like mentioned here: [<-LINK->]. That solved the post thing!.

issue: im confused, are you building an application or a lib? and are you using the cli to do so or a custom setup? 
solution: the reason for needing target = es2015 is that you need real classes for web components right?which I doubt google is buying into just yet?. 

issue: How to change nav bar after login in Angular 6? 
solution: zikoka_gitlab: You could check to see if there is a non-null user on your login service and use *ngIf to change your view. Unless you were looking for more specific.... zikoka_gitlab: you're better to have a top-level route(s) that define your navbars. 

issue: Does that actualyl provide any advanmtages to the "traditional" way? aside from code style 
solution: I am suire this part of these specific problems is that I always avoided real programming in js... because it didnt seem to have one defacto way of doing oo etc. Toxicable: a Custom Element classhasto extend from HTMLElement, so inheritance is baked in. mixins allow for behavior to be mixed in as appropriate, vs having everything extend from a monolithic base implementation.

solution: return this.licenseDataService.getLicenseInfo()            .subscribe((response) => {                return response['versionNumberField'];            });and in LicenseService you try to Subscribe to what LicenseDataService returns which is already a Subscribtion. One of options is using map in LicenseService and then Subscribe in Component.return this.licenseDataService.getLicenseInfo()            .map((response) => {                return response['versionNumberField'];            });.

issue: an observable? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] why clicking on the button does not get the value soem value should get binded anyone? 
solution: When the button is clicked you\'re setting the value of "Lname" to "This is some".. When you change formGroup.value.whatever, you\'re bypassing the formControl\'s internal mechanisms of permeating that change. You should call formGroup.controls.Lname.setValue("This is some").

issue: Hi need help, How can we stop angular from loading imported module's routes to parent when lazy loading? Detailed question: [<-LINK->] 
solution: soachishti: ... then you have some misunderstanding - routes are the integral part of such a module ... remember ... to have really "lazy loaded" modules ... you can\'t reference them directly in any of eagerly loaded module ... and the only relation is the textual reference vialoadChildren: \'..............\'because it is just text string..

solution: I can see there are bunch of spec files and written for the testing the directives and other modules, how do I run them? I want to add some tests there.. 

issue: npm ls macaddress the cli dosen't use that module 
solution: I think it was css-loader and css-nano that specifically referenced it.. well the cli has never directly depended on it. 

issue: It's a input of a angular component. Passed by setter not a method. So I can handle the input and e.g. call a value refresh method.You mean I could just use: [<-CODE->] right? 
solution: I\'ve problems ... right?  I think it\'s important to avoid dirty code if so many people working on it.tslint"extends": ["tslint:recommended"]is very strict.I have morekey: falsewith the tslint recommended options. hehe. Maybe it\'s easier to allow single options.. 

issue: Yes but when i sub and tben unsub from task sub,all owner subs remain open? 
solution: You subscribe to the entire rxjs "pipe", when you unsubscribe/takeUntil, the entire pipe is "told" to be unsubscribed. Be sure to put the takeUntil at the "end" of the pipe, otherwise it doesn. Hmm oke... never seen takeUntil, ill try this 2! Thx.

issue: guys how to use JWT? any good tutorial ? 
solution: But in a nutshell, the payload's just a Base64 encoded JSON object, stringified.  The last part's a signature, the first part describes the signing algorithm.  There are some security issues that jwt.io talks about related to the first part (namely leaving the algorithm off to bypass signature checks).. 

issue: So I've been playing with the idea of using@SkipSelf() private _parentChangeDetectorRef: ChangeDetectorRefto make sure that@HostBindings are updated appropriately. Does that seem like a bad idea or a good idea? 
solution: Toxicable: the input is changing, but then I'm combining multiple inputs to set a new class with a@HostBindingwhich I understanddoesn'tupdate by design, as they live in the parent view. So, I'm manually detecting changes with the parentChangeDetectorRef. 

issue: when user clicks a button I want to create a file and write some code to it and then download it. I am stuck in how to write a file? Is there any lib already available for it? 
solution: Lax2165: You're not going to be able to easily write a file using the browser. Your web server is going to have to do much of the work. I solved this years ago by creating a browserless web client in a library that my ASP.NET backend used to download single page applications such at the one you are describing. it downloaded all files required to view and use the single page application, and put them into a folder which it then zipped up and emailed to a recipient list. It obtained the html document, then used regex expressions to parse the document so that it could perform all of the other get requests. The recipient would have to unzip the file to view it. That was the only drawback..

solution: mlc-mlapis: the thing is that Angular is pretty vast and i have this feeling that whenever a person is making a web application he/she is not going to use all the properties. BuntyBru: , I use angular every day and probably 15% of the framework I rarely touch. 

issue: How on earth is[disabled]supposed to work? It doesn't seem to work on my textinputs 
solution: I think so. I see references to it in the angular tutorial for example. But can't find proper docs for it.. But I only see it used with buttons in the docs.

issue: Hi everyone 
solution: mlc-mlapis: I was able to debug further and If I timeout a writeValue call, the list will have 2 elements instead of 3 but ngDoCheck on the map catches it first before writevalue. 

issue: 你好 ... 
solution: 歪果仁估计在睡觉吧. 

issue: why is data$ readonly? 
solution: what ghet is saying, is this… when data$ is undefined it’ll evaluate as fasley, so the*ngIfwill evaluate as falsey and call#loadinginstead. 

issue: o.O 
solution: 

issue: Everything seems to be in your service. 
solution: mblackbourne: ... it looks that you simply don't want to believe us. You CAN'T do anything on a client side. You have to do the right config on a server side. No other way.. mlc-mlapis: I don't know what other way to tell you that I am new at this and trying to figure it out. If you cannot be constructive please refrain from commenting. I don't know what the hell is broken. I know what I want to accomplish... I want this request to end up in my view, where I will place each object into a canvas.js graph.  I am looking for support, I don't know: What I dont know. 

issue: is there an easy way to output an nested TypeScript object as JsonObject to screena: A { b: B; c: C {d: D, e: E}}the json pipe seems to ignore typed objects in the upper object

issue: Anyone here using chart.js? 
solution: I want to use it in my customer-ui - I have created a line chart and I would like to style it to fit inside a mat-card. After researching what others have done to size a chart, I used ViewChild  and did nativeElement.height = 163 and nativeElement - 845. I understand this is not really good Angular practice.. 

issue: DUCK 
solution: i thought he was going to kill it, but he just held onto it. 

issue: FF ? Final Fantasy? 
solution: :-). I need a drink. Ugh.. 

issue: How can I make sure that aViewChildis bound, and if not wait for that to happen?  [<-CODE->] 
solution: latchezar-kostov-ascendlearning-com: you could use a setter for the viewChild/viewChildren. I was getting some weird behavior and my setter was getting called infinitely...not sure why. 

issue: I'm using Google Charts in my Angular app like [<-LINK->] but it's breaking my tests because google is not defined. How do I get the [<-LINK->] script into my component test suite so google is defined? Or should I initialize it in some other way? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Can we use functions in our templates? 
solution: amazonalexabot_twitter: of course i googled, but there is limited info about. borriej: I would fix my component but you have other options like ignoring that rule, whether inline or globally. 

issue: I am having to do some work in a React app. OMG does it make me like Angular. 
solution: It is making me crazy. Plus the tooling is bad (or I'm doing it wrong). Have to rely on Find all the time. No find usages or anything. It was supposed to be in Angular to start with but the contractor they hired didn't know Angular so he did it in React because the time table was short.. I have an opportunity to port it (read. rewrite) but I would be really sticking my neck out for that one so I'm going to bide my time and see.. 

issue: Hello everyone, how can I change this to useasyncpipe instead? [<-CODE->] 
solution: groh: I think you should use mergeMap to merge the two streams. then get rid of the subscription and use the async pipe in the template. 

issue: I have an input component that receives an array of numbers. The component modifies those numbers directly frim thevalue@Inputand I see the changes reflected in the parent component, but I don\'t need to use an EventEmitter in this case. Is that right? Since the values are getting updates something like "by reference" 
solution: 

issue: whats HEROES? is it an array of heroes? wait nvm it is 
solution: 

issue: whats the difference between angular/angular and angular.js . I am just a beginner 
solution: BUt someone told i should go to angular.js. DoraRajappan: It is a lot, but in sum: when AngularJS was looking at v2, they had to basically rearchitect everything, and created a brand new project based on the same base concepts. DoraRajappan: angularjs is the first version of the framework, as version two was completely different it's basically another framework and they currently exist both. but angularjs is LTS. It's adviced to continue with angular.. 

issue: Can we share data between two child components ? 
solution: BuntyBru: I suppose you could do it by communicating with the parent but that seems too tightly coupled. I believe the service would be the way..

issue: How can I watch a specific key of an object in an array? 
solution: mlc-mlapis: yes. But I have to trigger propagatechange when just a key of an object in an array gets changed.. 

issue: Are you using reactive forms? 
solution: jc040993: now. no. template driven. BuntyBru: can you tell me more about your problem.... 

issue: A[0].fruits.good? i'm being dumb haha, sorry was confused. but yea - use indexes 
solution: I'd need to see an actual example to see what the problem is but assuming you're assigning it to A with proper syntax and the third element is an object as well it'd be A[2].fruits.good. 

issue: @lazarljubenovici have used Template driven approach for a form of mineand now i want that as soon as i click a button , only 3 out of the 5 inputs are reset how can i achieve this ? 
solution: BuntyBru: do it manually. Set the variables which are binded to inputs to what ever value you want in a method and call that method when you click that button. If that is not your problem please be more precise about your question. 

issue: Hi All, if anyone can answer this question please  [<-LINK->] 
solution: virpatel_gitlab: ... for that cases attribute component is usually used ... like<table><tr myComponent></tr></table>.. virpatel_gitlab: ... you have to respect the HTML semantic ... and it is<table><tr>....</tr></table>... you can't have<table><myComponent><tr>...</tr></myComponent></table>. 

issue: Any angular examples for relation pouch dB for offline implementation?

issue: Is it possible to transfer data from one component to another component through just viewChild ? viewChild: 
solution: BuntyBru: ... you already got it.@ViewChild(MyComponent) myComponent: MyComponent;and thenthis.myComponent.myPublicProp = "...";.

solution: 

issue: what is VSTS 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] Why does not it work when the data arrives? Hi 
solution: itprodavets: ... the syntax is fine so the problem should be somewhere else.. 

issue: Hy Friend,@kpaxtonwould you please tryng serve --prod I think it will resolve your issue for AOT 
solution: 

issue: quick question for you folks... and not necessarily limited by just angular.... but do  you guys feel like building and deploying a js based SPA is suitable for business apps (not necessarily any more prone to hacking/tampering etc) 
solution: We'd get a failure with CLI stating that it cannot resolve the path (which make sense, since the templateURL we point at is the MVC Route for retrieving our Razor view). 

issue: Is there a way an app could only work in certain Browsers? 
solution: mlc-mlapis: yeah.. I should have add "inadvertently". 

issue: what is the best way to have dynamic (template) parts  in a component?ng-container? ng-template? 
solution: 

issue: Can someone explain to me what the difference is between a framework and a platform? 
solution: webdevil_gitlab: a framework is a set of tools all crafted into one product to achieve certain results more efficiently and with less headache they are always conceived to facilitate the development. A platform is where all this is ran, a platform is an OS, a service, a group of services…that’s how I see it. webdevil_gitlab: I’ve seen the misconception sometimes, I’ve seen folks call laravel a platform but the concept is not correct imho, laravel is a framework, Windows 3.1 is a platform..Docker is a platform..Lambda is a group of services that work as a platform to run your code…shrug. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] How do I pass the service reference from parent to the child component? 
solution: I want to change the behavior depending on the child and would like to keep the child simple. then don't inject the service, and just emit an event from the child, and pass data into it. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: DoraRajappan: you need an instance, that is just a class definition.. akapublic user = new User(). 

issue: if i have a service, i have to make a module for it or i can provide in app.module? 
solution: mmirzaeyan: ... so it looks that it's related to the event between the child and the parent component which emits repeatedly ... maybe in relation to CD cycle?. mmirzaeyan: ... so because the service makes the request and if you can see that it's called just once here ... then there could be only some RxJS operators which could be in the game ... and then just the interceptors.. 

issue: angular build is screwing up copyright symbol when we do ng build.. any idea on where to fix it? 
solution: ronnyek: so  this on html file but when generated.. it's lookign like this.

solution: 

issue: Is there any elegant way of showing error components without navigating to a target? I tried to handle 503 errors in resolvers with [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: lwensveen: because the router resolve feature is extremely convenient and gives much finer control in request handling..

issue: Maybe you can discuss this in priv-chat? 
solution: BuntyBru: @nasreddineskandraniAnd if you are on vs code you can use [<-LINK->]. Perfect for pair programming.. 

issue: Does anyone remember what that website(s) was that aggregates a bunch of Angular new/resources? 
solution: Matmo10: ... I use [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->]. Matmo10: ... + [<-LINK->]. I just remember someone in the angular community posted some website that was like an aggregator of all those sources. 

issue: ugh, ...can't help myself... i'll bite...@chrillewoodzbut why do you want that?? because first of all email validation is a static method you can use :/ 
solution: 

issue: for? 
solution: 

issue: a few tips here [<-LINK->] underOther operators 
solution: timothyblue: take(1) for a httpclient get is not needed, it already completes after the single response. A takeUntil implementation allows updateing that 'data' /underlying implemention without changing any of that code. For example when you application evolves to start using push changes from a websocket server or the user edits something inside the app in a different component.... 

issue: Anyone up for reading a draft Medium post? 
solution: phenomnomnominal: Wow Craig! That's pretty cool! Your explanations and examples are great for explaining a topic that could be very confusing. The only thing I had trouble with was figuring out how to actually implement a a custom tslint rule but when I clicked on the link to see the example at the bottom for the rxjs-tslint-rules I was able to understand how to do it.. 

issue: :D 
solution: 

issue: is any library in angular 5 to manage acl ? 
solution: ingmehdi: ... I know, but what it is from your seeing ... do you mean authorization to different parts of an client app or also some server logic?. ingmehdi: ... hmm, but the problem probably starts on a server ... because nothing on a client can give you the real security .... 

issue: for what? 
solution: 

issue: hey is there any sort of set standard to map a data object into the querystring hash? so all edits auto map to it.. in some sort of url friendly json format? 
solution: so like if they are editing in the form.. which is mapped to an object... have that object also be linked to the hashtag so all edits auto change the hash, for link copy/pasting or bookmarking. 

issue: people still use odata? 
solution: 

issue: how do I do a setValue on a dynamic form? 
solution: chrillewoodz: I got a back-end that sends a model through api to the client. In the client I got a form (formgroup) which needs to communicate with the model to save the data and get the data.. 

issue: oh god create a function for that event please 'expended?'is wrong 
solution: 

issue: is your lib on npm or in the same project? 
solution: Ofcourse. but hm. 

issue: gotta love the sneaky religious message too 
solution: and lorem ipsum below that, to show the contrast. idk about you but I always give a snippet from the Bible every time an API call is successful. 

issue: Guys, anyone knows two-handled slider lib for angular6? 
solution: chrillewoodz: It integrates into Visual Studio. It is for C#.NET (mostly). It's a continuous integration framework for tracking issues, writing unit tests, etc. etc. One of the best things I have ever used in the 28 years I have been writing software.. 

issue: im trying to find the source of your conversation but i cant what's the deal? 
solution: 

issue: why dont you build it yourself@erasad22? 
solution: 

issue: why don't you use attribute selectors for this? that's a lot saner than replacing, no? (which is how we do this in material, for example) 
solution: I realize components rendered by router get rendered next to router-outlet, but because that automatically creates a div with the attribtue selector, or just uses tags for the component. 

issue: Anyone gotten Adobe Target to work with Angular? It seems Adobe’s own implementation is very old. 
solution: (seems like one of those classic "you can probably do this with google analytics and open source tools but sure, call Adobe sales reps today). 

issue: Or add data to your routes  to define the animations there? 
solution: 

issue: How to achieve this? Based  on value it should automatically resize this bar 
solution: Prithivraj200: I agree with the learn css. You can let angular set the width in percentages with [style.width]; add some CSS, and you should be able to achieve that relatively easy.. Yes, of course. You could quite easily create a container with the right column of a fixed width and the left filling the remainder space. Within that left container you can then create the bars with a percentage width and a inline-block display, or absolute position and a left and right. When using SASS / LESS it's even easier.. 

issue: you use component UIs like Material design? right 
solution: in our company we have little time, so i can't have enough time to develop from scratch. 

issue: Which chart is best suitable for angular 6 projects ? 
solution: ^   You speak da truth.. chrillewoodz: If you have worked with Highcharts I think then you can say yes or no. If not I will seek help from others..

issue: how do I use ngStyle to set 'display' only sometimes?  I see how to switch values, but not just set it only in a certain condition 
solution: I don\'t believe so, though I guess you can try it? At that point, why not just have a method that returns it? You can also try[style.display]="condition ? \'none\' : \'\'". 

issue: unless you use the async flag 
solution: I mean, everything is in the docs. But if I knew where I wouldn’t need to be here :P.

issue:  [<-LINK->] this is what i have but hte i now have an error of ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError 
solution: and don't subscribe in the constructor like that. better in ngOnInit. and when i get to the login screen i set it to true. 

issue: why i am getting providers value null on first calling set state method [<-CODE->] and recieving component [<-CODE->] 
solution: @subhashish12 Your subscription will always call first time when your constructor called. At that time, you would receive default value "null" which you have set in your code without calling setState method even a single time.Put a condition of NOT NULL in your subscription and execute logic inside that condition.

issue: Hi. Does anyone have experience with Ag-grid? 
solution: tnerbovik: , I currently am working with Ag-grid, maybe I can help you. GreatHawkeye: without pagination there may be no problems.. but with pagination, you have to go to the last item in the table to find the sum row.

issue: Can anyone explain to me why they want to use observables for http so bad? firebase? 
solution: lwensveen: they use observables vs promises because Angular wants to go for a reactive approach with streams. Have you not noticed EVERYTHING in the Angular world is observables (rxjs, ngrx, ActivatedRoute) etc. It’s a lot more than just your typical http. 

issue: it's just to get the data asynchronously 
solution: you just want to make sure you're not blocking processes. 

issue: hey there, i've got a maybe simple question but i really can't find a good answer online :/If i have an angular project (version 2+) and the app is loaded in the browser... And after a while i async get (from some api) a string like this: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]

issue: Function calls are not supported in decorators but 'DashboardsRoutesService' was called in 'ROUTES' how to fix in production build? any idea about   Function calls are not supported in decorators but 'DashboardsRoutesService' was called in 'ROUTES'? 
solution: pavinthan: ... there should be something aroundDashboardsRoutesService... something what is called ... and because of Angular compiler uses static analyzing = doesn't run any JS during compilation ... anything what means to run code to understand what it is, leads to the error message likeFunction calls are not supported in decorators ..... 

issue: Where do you guys go with non-angular but webdev specific questions? 
solution: depends… some just ask here as folks are pretty diverse in their knowledge here, but if it gets too deep you may be best off finding a channel specific to the tech you’re needing help w/. 

issue: May I know if anyone have exposure to angular js with azure code for acquireToken 
solution: vphanibhushanreddy: there is an angular JS forum here aswell, maybe that is better.. 

issue: Can a PipeTransform only have one method called transform? 
solution: sbreed: if you want multiple functions out of same pipe just pass params. 

issue: do you have 2 subscriptions? 
solution: no. only once. then you're triggering it twice. it's either one or the other. 

issue: I bet its easier for the team to make the compiler work with Bazel 
solution: Then it does that everywhere throughout the project, then thats TS -> JS doneonto bundling with something such as RollupThis is the current setup.

solution: 

issue: which type of loop would be ok with you splicing the iterable it's traversing? forEach? 
solution: you'd probably want a map operation instead though from the sounds of it. Array.prototype.slice. 

issue: I've just updated my angular app from 4.4 to 6.1 but now I only see a white page. There seem to be fewer scripts getting bundled. After the update there are only 5 shown, before there were like 50 
solution: 

issue: this is in a component's stylesheet? 
solution: and it applies globally?. you haveencapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None. 

issue: you're aware you're returning the dekkigen ? not the data object anymore 
solution: 

issue: I'm using Angular Material and want to display some editable nodes. Anyone know of any examples of this kind of UI, I'm just trying to figure out what I want it to look like 
solution: broweratcognitecdotcom: Yup, the tree is the obvious choice but I'm just worried it could get very messy with a lot of nodes although I don't think it will be a problem most of the time. I was thinking of maybe having some kind of tree explorer too, kind of like file explorer I suppose but not sure if that's good UI either. 

issue: why would you want that? 
solution: cause in the child component I might update a value and need to later refresh data from server. but yeah trackBy would work. 

issue: what type of wizard? 
solution: 

issue: broweratcognitecdotcom: "If your server is a LINUX server then .NET is hardly a good choice." Are you including .NET Core in that statement? All my backend stuff is written with that but deployed on windows, should I be expecting a bunch of issues if deploying to Linux? 
solution: I have a function that gets called in response to a material select's selectionChange event. The function should set the validators for and enable or disable a FormControl. But there is a problem. When changing the dropdown so that the FormControl should be enabled and have a required validator, for some reason, the value is not being included in data. 

issue: if you have any kind of sending data to somewhere, even if only for some logical computations, move it to the service layer 
solution: if you want a strongly typed object model yes. 

issue: learn typescript then head on to angular 
solution: 

issue: Hi,Any idea how to add template variable to the component dynamically like below<child #child1></child><child #child2></child> 
solution: @xAirx: HiI have the form and form has the reuseable components as shown belowName: TerxtBox -- form-input componentDivision: TextBox -- form-input componentthese components are created dynmamically. I would like to access these components.. 

issue: I learned today Angular 6 doesn't support IE11. How can this be??? 
solution: sliceofbytes: Not on my home computer. Not on our work PC's. Something with polyfills I think. 

issue: Who is moving ? 
solution: sliceofbytes: but I think that wont work. Since if some children have children they will no longer be iterated over since only ones with null are left in the first map. I didn't try it but just looking at it , I think it will do children of children. well it is but we don't care about cousins in object models :). 

issue: whats new in angular7 and its it actually released? 
solution: and if so, have people seen practical benefits in their apps. 

issue: why does calling setValue on a form control triggers validation for all other controls in reactive forms ? 
solution: 

issue: Anyone here use ngrx? I'm trying to figure it out, getting nowhere, and am unsure if I'm just an idiot. 
solution: 

issue: Bootstrap is a framework, material is a style guide 
solution: Material has nothing structurally based, it provides common components you can use so you have to write less code. You can use both together..

solution: 

issue: piotr-mamenas: Have you ever worked with Server Side Events in Angular? 
solution: 

issue: Angular 7 released ?? ???

issue: Debating wether i should go with karma jasmine for unit testing or jest.. 
solution: 

issue: I have a parent component with 2 child components. Can I have another component specify how these are displayed in it's template, like so? [<-CODE->] I'd like to allow the user of the component to decide on how the data should be displayed I guess not as the parent component will replace the children with it's template. I'll give directives a go 
solution: broweratcognitecdotcom: Yer my problem is that I haveNodeEditorTreeandNodeEditorDetailcomponents. I want to have a parent component that injects a service to both of these children but I don't want that parent to decide where to place the two child components. So I am just looking for a way of outsourcing that decision to the end user.. 

issue: Component inheritance? Extend the parent component 
solution: 

issue: how did y’all start learning angular? 
solution: saunlani: I was thrown to the wolves on a job. They said hey you will be coding in Angular. So I took Max Schwarzmuellers class on UDemy. i did see that course on Udemy tho, something like 63000 people rated it at an average of 4.6/5. 

issue: Guys, if ChangeDectectionStrategy.OnPush is so great, why is it not on by default when you do ng g component?

solution: getting array of objects. And I want json format of data. 

issue: yeah chromes autofill is going to be the literal death of me no, chrome doesn't honour autocomplete off anymore nor any of the workarounds I can find 
solution: 'we have determined that the current functionality is useful and functional. This could not be allowed'. 

issue: I am curios how ember is doing that, how is injecting the file names into the decorator 
solution: and the class name is usually the component name, and by convention, should be the file name. yes. if you can come with an idea. 

issue: What is the best way to monitor the value of a select input that is outside of the router-outlet, from in side of the router-outlet? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] Guys,  could you help the newbie here? 
solution: Rodnorm: After skimming over the code you gave, I'd be left to assume the helper methods your calling are the cause, (formBuilderService.getControlFields and formBuilderService.build) are you sure they are handling the right references?. 

issue: ? 
solution: 

issue: Anyone mind helping me figure out an rxjs thing? I'm not sure how to type this to get it to work properly 
solution: 

issue: Same here, maybe restart tslint? OR double check your package versions stackblitz gave me 404 
solution: (I've used this particular snippet a bunch of times, just never with a combineLatest). 

issue: I am newbie 
solution: 

issue: Thanks@bradtaniguchi. Is there a workaround for this ? i don't want the parent to get the updated value. 
solution: MSAJJAN-EEOC: creating a variable in the parent component would still reference the original object. Depending on how complex the data is, the easiest for simple data is to just copy over the values into a new object. The next level would be Object.assign, but this creates a "shallow" copy (1 level deep) anything past that your talking about deep clones. 

issue: @xAirxusedgot this as error [<-CODE->]

issue: i18n is what you're after 
solution:

solution: 

issue: Is there anylib out there that has a slider like component with multiple thumbs or a component similar to what you usually see for shipment tracking. 
solution: adaliszk: yeah but it has only one thumb/slider. I would have to align these side by side and wrap them into a component. I feel like something like this should already be out there. 

issue: Good Morning ! 
solution: Might be an issue with that library, I can't get their basic example to work. sliceofbytes: i used ngx-chips. But the thing is that i need it inside a textarea. 

issue: Hi, I am new to Angular 
solution: go through the official tutorial and start building a small project in stackblitz. 

issue: can you destructure an array in function arguments?  I can’t remember

issue: Is it possible to reach an 'external' formgroup from inside a formarray-loop? 
solution: I don't want to push firstName (per the example above) into the array, I want to know if it's possible to use the already existing controller inside the formArray loop.. 

issue: bookmarking it can be usefull :) 
solution: Normally you would be using a mock backend for that purpose but i guess this would serve as an easy alternative :). 

issue: Hi guys, would you please let me know why we need to use resolver in routes 
solution: @techyguy786 The main use-case is if you don\'t want to load the page until you get the data. If you don\'t use a resolver your usually loading the component before the data, so the component is showing some loading or something before-hand.The other use-case is making async code "sync" in the component context. 

issue: hi guys, how can i manually set my form to invalid i tried this: this.formGroup.setErrors({'invalid':true}); but that doesnt work any suggestions? 
solution: h__maatouk_twitter: think you can mark the form as dirty or touched, then updateValueAndValidity. 

issue: hey all 
solution: i'd have to pull down another project to really test it out since the one i have right now is pretty much empty compared to my others i code on the mac (for work). 

issue: Maybe a silly question but when setting up routing I often find myself having to create a component which just has<router-outlet></router-outlet>in the template for the parent route and several child routes, my question is this, is there a way to do this without needing to creating a component 
solution: No none at all, I was just querying as it seems to me a bit of a waste of a component when all you want is arouter-outletand nothing else. I know you can inline the styles and template so you ultimately just end up with a single file but seems like there should be somway in the router config to allow for this. Like if you have a parent without a component and children then it would route to the children as if the parent had a component with arouter-outlet. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] what providenIn does ? 
solution: 

issue: yup 
solution: is cypress also specifically made for angular?. 

issue: Hi new to angular. When should I use HostListener over HostBinding? they look like they do pretty much the same thing. 
solution: amarbham: one is to listen for events on the host and perform an action the other is for setting a property on the host. amazonalexabot_twitter: basically instead of storing any of the PI, you get a token back from your financial vendor that represents the transaction. 

issue: Hi, Assuming i'm on an url like that :/:param/somethinghow i can redirect the user to /:param using router.navigate keeping the same param ?

issue: Hello does anyone using Jointjs or Gojs with angular here? 
solution: sliceofbytes: I have difficulty to choose between jsplumb, joints, and GoJs, did you get a great experience with it, or was something missing (feature, integration issue)?. I don't know anything about joinjs or GoJs so can't really compare. 

issue: its recommendate to use angular material? 
solution: i would use angular material but Material is not allowed in my project. the problem is when i use another  input with datepicker and then when i click the other input it stop propagation and then it doesnt close the opened datepicker. alexcarrasco93: make a stackblitz and I'll take a look but given that it is a custom datepicker I'd say handle it in the datepicker :). 

issue: I have two questions people, is angulars change detection strategy inherited by children components when changed to OnPush? 
solution: And you're sure that if I want the whole application to use OnPush strategy I have to set it in every component?. 

issue: wy would the component need to be imported into the parent?  [<-LINK->] that's a WIP as i fill in details and stuff, but that should give you an idea 
solution: I would like to see this with a reactive forms example. Just a thought. 

issue: best ide nowdays and why?:p 
solution: 

issue: are there any resources for protractor and angular? I can only find angularjs stuff 
solution: Failed: No element found using locator: By(css selector, *[id="navigation-menu"]).

issue: forgot to save a file and include in the module 
solution: 

issue: are where some best practices on how to organize your functions and variables in your page components? mine are getting huge and diorganized 
solution: it depends, but sometimes I have a service which is used for a component or two exlcusively. 

issue: What do you remove from imports? 
solution: automaticly. 

issue: so why would you choose nativescript over ts? 
solution: but then when I realized there wasnt a TON you could reuse it was kinda meh. 

issue: Quick question guys Why can\'t I do "Observable.from()"? it's saying [ts] Property 'from' does not exist on type 'typeof Observable'. 
solution: 

issue: should i upgrade from v.6 to 7? 
solution: 

issue: How can I listen for a shortcut in an element (e.g. atextarea)? Do I have to check both keys? 
solution: tiagomsmagalhaes: just bind to onkeydown and use a condition on the keys you want. like ctrl+enter on windows/linux or command+enter on macOS. well you could just use a keyup hostbinding in your component and check the keys. 

issue: The thing is that the main modifier on macOS is Command (or Meta Key) 
solution: sliceofbytes: mousetrap has this covered. Maybe I'll check for the textarea formcontrol and if it's empty I ignore. 

issue: Is there a way to programmatically create expression context variables in a template (so I could create one in a loop)? 
solution: Specifically in my case I have a component that takes, as an optional input, a reference to the previous instance of the component (as its parent) to create a hierarchy.However if I have an unknown number of chained components, how can I create that reference from parent to child?. If I wanted to loop through an arbitrary number of components, and assign each one a new context variable to pass asparentto the next, how can I do that?. 

issue: what virtual scroll system are you using? 
solution: I’m honestly not sure if there is a way to rerender items in the virtual scroll viewport if there are new items added/removed from a virtualFor list. aaah i haven't gotten a chance to look at that yet, gimme a sec to look at the docs. 

issue: Won't they be rerendered via change detection as normal? 
solution: Feed it a proper materialDataSourceinstead.. Or anObservableof your array.. 

issue: hey guys can someone recommend a blog or tuts on how to make angular fast. TIA 
solution: 

issue: Is it fair to say that the component that is Bootstrapped in your bootstrap module can't be affected by the ActivatedRoute(s)? 
solution: Yes, now, as a follow up question, say you put something outside your router-outlet, and now want it to be changed by a route? Am I basically screwed? Do I have to refactor everything so that that part of the page is inside the router-outlet?. 

issue: just'.' 
solution: 

issue: you still haven't described why my snippet wont work? 
solution: 

issue: this is a custom datepicker by me i am testing it for 1st time after creation

issue: is it possible to call a service from the model? 
solution: You can have the service load everything for each model, but this is use-case dependant. If your making extra async requests for every single model no matter what your using, id consider refactoring how you get the original model from the backend to return more data, if it cuts down on extra network calls.. 

issue: why do i get this errors?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: alexandrupintilei: because username is not a property on your component it is a property on your form group. 

issue: Could it be a browser extension,@babeal? 
solution: "Ag" -- could it be "ag-grid"?. 

issue: and the error is... ? 
solution: 

issue: sure why not 
solution: gotcha. but im just one guy. right - be careful with those kind of barrel files. 

issue: Like this? [<-LINK->] 
solution: wdunn001: I don't think this is an angular issue, rather you expect the value ofnameto be changed via reference to the input, but that's not going to work. Since the name is passed by value not reference, UNLIKE the value of the input.

solution: dgroh: But it does seem possible manually. Here is what I just did... After the last command above failed, I opened VS Code and opened the sublibs folder. I copied and pasted projects/myscope/core and pasted it inside itself then renamed it to auth. Then I went into all of the config files in projects/myscope/core/auth and modified the paths. Then I renamed all the files in projects/myscope/core/auth/src. Now when I build@myscope/core, it just automatically builds@myscope/core and@myscope/core/auth and I see that arrangment in the dist folder.. 

issue: what is the good way to manage styling (css) in angular, like we shoule write css for each and every component ?  or we can put global css for all angular app and put link index.html ? 
solution: erasad22: Your question will become important if you are working on a team of different people, and every different person uses his own class names, and conventions in different components. You will want to pull your hair out. It is a good idea to create common classes in styles.css or another stylesheet so that you have a sort of library of css classes to choose from rather than giving each developer complete freedom. This will become especially relevant if you use bootstrap which I personally find difficult and timeconsuming to work with..

solution: i want set data from remote repository to the product variable. but i'cant get that value.. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] help me here facing observable issue 
solution: But I also would not want to do too much async stuff in APP_INITIALIZER, always find you eventually want to show user 'loading' feedback anyway, so instead the services would all just have async methods, so it can be checked somewhere in a loading component. 

issue: heh look, ask yourself.. component in/components/add-formknow Add form.. is it possible without anything else? but Idk which folder structure yre u using because I don't have containers 
solution: In future maybe you need useadd-to-basketin different module. Heh, my recommendation is duplicate this component in new module and use same name, reason is that business logic is cloud of mystery and you never know what happens and you are ready to make differences across modules :).

issue: why do you want Static methods? or rather; why do y ou want static methods on a interface? 
solution: I wanted them to be static prebuilt states to fire change detection. Because before we were mutating objects and change detection wasn't picking it up... so I thought instead of callMyType.reset();I'll saymyStatus = MyType.Empty();My initial goal was to just move to immutability and it seemed to make more sense to make it static..

issue: does grub hub or uber eats have an exposed api?

issue: Does anyone know any projects similar to Gatsby done in Angular? 
solution: i've recently started working on something that mimick it, but it wont be easy as gatsby is highly optimized and have a giant community of developers creating plugins for it.. this [<-LINK->] will probably be the first step, generating an application state from all different sources provided by plugins and passing this state to the application when server init. 

issue: anyone know if this [<-LINK->] is still maintained? 
solution: Because your trying to minimise TTFI, but you end up sending more code, which ends up being actually worse..

issue: you mean a clock? 
solution: but can't seem to wrap my head around it. you could setup a polling service to poll for the time ever N seconds, and when a certain time is reached do something. outside of that you’d need something like a websocket connection to some system to feed you the time.

solution: 

issue: Is it possible to bundle images into JS using the angular cli?

solution: 

issue: why isnt my observable updating my view? but fires in console log?

solution: 

issue: Hi, I'm learning angular for a few months, but it's very hard for me and I'm disappointed you did that at the very beginning? :( 
solution: epimeth: I have chosen angular interest but it is very complicated. I learned the material design but I did not understand the relationships in coding and until now I could not connect the angular to the database and call the data that disrupted me.I did not like my job and left it to get angular or earn money.. mostafampz: phpisthe server side... angular is front-end.  Also, this channel is for angularjs, not angular.... look.  Comparing "angular" to "php" is not a thing you can do at all.  If anything "angular" should be compared to "cakePHP" or "ZendFramework"... which are frameworkswritten in phpso you have to know php in order to use them.  It is the same with angular.  If you don\'t know typescript then you can\'tjust learnangular.  You need to build up to it, you understand?.

issue: jagdishjadeja: what is some typo? 
solution: 

issue: plz any tuto or doc i need somme quide for upload file with angular 6 and nosql 
solution: but that makes sense, you can't expect the framework to detect changes in the input types and change the parsing method accordingly, input types are very declarative and are part of html5. to achieve such generic behavior lots of complex parsing should be handled. 

issue: from where ?

issue: no 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] I hade this once running tests when router was used in service. 
solution: A-STAR: i implemented a guard that uses an observable. Before it was just a stub and i didn’t face this problem. but as soon as I started piping an observable from a service i would get that warning, and an unusable view.. A-STAR: i just tapped the pipe and I’m outside on that type of routes. If I select a record on a table I’m inside the zone. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: nemeciii_twitter: don't use function on bindings and use an input if you want to pass data to the component and not apply the class on it directly. 

issue: important release, will resolve the issue with loading multiple Zones 
solution: yeah, I guess it might help with multiple angular elements on a page being slow.. 

issue: what's the use of combining the material design stuff with bootstrap for grids ?

issue: how in mat-toolbar-row can you make the buttons pull to the right ? 
solution: ekarlso: put a span before and give it flex-grow: 1. there are different ways. that is just one. 

issue: Is there any reason to use "forRoot()" in the main app.module?/* app.module.ts */\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [MyModule.forRoot(),\n... 
solution: however, there are times when you want to use write a forRoot() and maybe a forFeature() or forChild() function. It depends on the modules and how you need something to be provided.. 

issue: where would be the perfect place to locate ssl keys in production app? can i put in /dist/ folder? 
solution: danielha0221_gitlab: , they should be kept in database and should be fetched via api as far as i know. But still if you want to keep them on client side. You can keep them in evironment files. So in future you can have different keys for different environment.

solution: 

issue: With angular 7 and rxjs 6 I noticed that I have rxjs operators that are not in use in my project inside my bundle though I have a package "primeng" which also uses rxjs could that be the reason? 
solution: nemeciii_twitter: @ghetolayI use primeNG 7 though, I also don't think the operator used by angular would make me see more than 30 operators I do not recognise using in my project whenever I analyse my bundles.  Looks like all the operators are in my bundle if am not mistaken. 

issue: how we can communicate between two components which don't have parent-child or sibling relationship 
solution: mateothegreat: can you provide me a link to a article or something like that describing that. you can injectprivate formsService: FormsServicein your component(s) constructors and share it’s values. 

issue: I am having trouble understanding services As in the concept of services. I mean I seem to forget the analogy or the working because I cannot associate with it. 
solution: dienigma: You could think of a service as a class (which has methods and properties) which you give access to a component by "injecting" it. dienigma: To add to that, the idea of "injectables" is part of dependency injection, where you "ask" for classes and Angular will create and manage them for you. Along with this Angular generally will create1 instance of the injectable (or service) accross the entire appso you can use it as your "state" as well, as components come and go.. 

issue: You could even run that in plunkr with angularjs@bradtaniguchi, so I'm not sure why it won't work in stackblitz ? 
solution: 

issue: What is container component ? 
solution: sahilkatia: Even tho this article is mainly related to react, it'll answer your question aswell: [<-LINK->]. The concept in react is comparable to angular, hence I said it'll answer your question..

issue: how do i write template literals inside interpolation?{{`${c.name} ${c.id}`}} 
solution: Or a pipe (if you wanted to get that verbose). I wouldn't I see no reason to, the interpolation is already more or less a template literal anyways. 

issue: does anyone know how to have a website to show these additional information? 
solution: danielha0221_gitlab: You should always worry about that. The Angular framework has some pretty awesome XSS injection prevention, but any library you use could be using plain old JS and be a risk, any script you include could be a risk, and any native element manipulation you do could be a potential risk.. 

issue: angular language service on VScode works in all files but it doesn't in index.html (root html) how can i fix this 
solution: 

issue: I need a form to submit data from a modal? or just a submit method to modal tag?

solution: 

issue: Hi everybody, a quick question I wanted clarification on. I'm attempting to sanitize the CSS returned from a function that's being used by ngStyle, can't seem to find the best way? 
solution: ghetolay: I think the issue is the styles are being defined by user input, but it's a design system so that's sort of the point if that makes sense?. 

issue: BDGLunde: ... what is the main point of the saying ...I need to render the template from a child in its parent? 
solution: or if the parent had interchangable types of child components, it would be nice to be able to render what they wanted if they conformed to some sort of "implicit interface". BDGLunde: ... you can also use observable / subscription pattern and cross any boundaries ... and not be dependent on parent / child relation..

solution: mlc-mlapis: I’m just trying to get the test to pass. I still have the genericexpect…toBeTruthy()method but it’s failing because my directive has two dependencies that I need to include in my test.. @mlc-mlapis If I do something like: [<-CODE->] This solves my problem and the test successfully passes.

solution: hungerregnuh: Yep I think so. My Problem is, that I think, I do touch a "Limit" of Angular/Material here and there is no way to solve it.I think I Need to directly use MatSelect in my comp or create a copy of the AppSelect, but this all will end in duplicated Code and I wanted to not do that :/.

issue: Did I read correctly when subscribing to http requests from the HttpClientModule, you don't need to unsubscribe? 
solution: jreeter: You can provide code to "cancel" the request tho (my fave istakeUntil) or use theasyncpipe. As Milos said, there wont be a memory leak, but canceling the request should improve performance since your saying you don\'t care about the response at all (since you left the "view"). 

issue: Hey people, is this expected that the Angular HTTP Client retry a request when it receives a 504 errors? I haven't configured that anywhere in my code… 
solution:

solution: 

issue: are you talking about a standalone lib? like utilizing angular projects 
solution: I would think if you wanted to utilize it as a local package you could just include it as a peer dependency. You make have to include the css in each app you use the lib in. 

issue: Hey can someone explain me whygetColor()is called even though I haveChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush? [<-LINK->] 
solution: bifty: There's no such lifehook in angular iirc. Can you explain what do you mean?. but also change detection mechanism plays a role. using the function in the template is something different than using only thecolorvariable.

issue: If I am in the  angular material modal window and I want to call a parent method, without closing the pop up, how should I do that? 
solution: shekharramola: Through a service may be. you can pass a subject reference through mat data to the dialog component and use that subject to emit it and subscribe in parent. One more similar approach add@Outputin dialog component and get the component instance using dialog ref in parent component and subscribe to it.. 

issue: I have a function (getData()) which loads my page-data. Now I want to do a automatic refresh of it every 5 secondes. How can I do this? 
solution: coderishu: No I don't want to do a reload. I want to do it in a more polite way and only want to load my data,not the whole page. 

issue: Also, maybe you dont want to do this(resolved)="response = in($event)”in the template :) 
solution: And need to call in($event) function inside next() function. And need to call in($event) function inside next() functionwhy do you need a function wrapper to call another function? why dont you do (resolved)=“next($event)”? maybe more context is needed. 

issue: Hey hey, maybe someone can help me out with this - [<-LINK->] , Thanks!

solution: GoNode5: hum idk, angular routing is strongly based on hierarchy, maybe you can get it usingrouter.events. ghetolay: not necessarily route api but before AppComponent or in Appcomponent but its already rerouting  to [<-CODE->]. 

issue: I have been all over the net including the Angular docs and I can't find or think of a way of sharing data across lazily loaded modules. here's my hierarchy [<-CODE->] Anyone can give me some insights???

issue: isproviders: [in@componentdecorator same asproviderin@module? do they do exactly the same think ? 
solution: I wrote my ownDateAdapter. I want it only to be used in one component. 

issue: Why should one consider making a routing module instead of exporting routing constant ofModuleWithProviderstype and using it in imports? 
solution: broweratcognitecdotcom: but the actual module with component declarations would suffice then, right? So there is no actual reason to create a separate module for routes? [<-LINK->] The only reason, that comes in mind is that one is a super neat freak.. 

issue: Is it possible to get a custom decorator to tree shake? E.g. can you get rid of__decorate? 
solution: (this is why the cli has a specific module for removing decorator meta). Right, but you could inject a typescript transform in the build pipeline?. 

issue: D:

issue: So for some reason the file reader api just doesn't support loading the same file twice 
solution: TurkeyDev: just put the value of the input to '' (if you are using native <input>). Not using native input. Still doesn\'t work... I tried setting the value of the hidden input that controls the files to "" and tried to clear the model.

solution: I want to navigate to the same page (route.navigate) and have the page reloaded  entirely, and this option  (onSameUrlNavigation: 'reload') on the router is supposed to to so.... 

issue: why not use [<-LINK->] ? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Is it a regex ? 
solution: no. I mean with that routing config, you're going to have competing routes.

issue: Hi, is there a way to make the entire dialog modal show up in the print / print preview, and not have the overflow be cut off? 
solution: that should be all that is required, worst case scenario you can create a .print class div in your body and just copy modal contents to it before print. 

issue: How do I get  a specific html component to be displayed in my index.html? 
solution: 

issue: is this a problem?  [<-LINK->]

solution: 

issue: i want to be a full stack developer so after angular what should i learn? please suggest me. 
solution: spring boot. jpa . hibernate... 

issue: Any ideas how can I call recursively this function? [<-CODE->] 
solution: mlc-mlapis: I mean callingthis.UserService.sendMessage(term, localStorage.getItem('current_path') + '/')with differenttermparameter. Can you show how it could be done?. 

issue: With and without duplicates may be?? 
solution: 

issue: try to make a stackblitz. then we can really assist. 
solution: skiabox: that's not necessary. are you using reactive forms?. 

issue: is gmail  built on Angular? 
solution: No.  [<-LINK->]. but when  I  inspect, i see code similar to angularjs. also.  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: I am dealing with a large dataset and aMatAutocomplete.  Anyone have any recommendations getting it to work faster?  My filter is taking almost a second to complete when checking  ~300 objects string properties to see if they contain the typed in string, and I envision that data set to become much larger. 
solution: 

issue: a getter? 
solution:

solution: yes.  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: what@hungerregnuhbut for the record@DrMuhammadAnju1_twittersys.argvis an array, the first being the name of the file but that's all I'll say! 
solution: works fine in chrome, fails in chrome incognito and firefox LOL. 

issue: Interesting, so it will build all the libs and then build the projects in correct order ?> 
solution: It's like a poor-man's Bazel (which I've been too afraid of touching as the docs for it are sparse at best). 

issue: is angular cli likely to be backwards compatible? Eg, if I have a 6.xx project, should cli 7.1.4 be able to compile it 
solution: 

issue: @rwfreshDoes "mappings" have a specific meaning in Angular?nope 
solution: this would be pretty straight forward using calculated fields and functions in Vue.js but I've got zero experience with Angular so not so easy. 

issue: you dont need the@importin the styles array 
solution: CapsAdminbut if i remove the import from a component's scss file (if i use styleUrls instead) it doesn't find the variables i declared in styles.scss. 

issue: Separated by boundary... your file data can be seen in your request payload... cant u see that? if you can see that the file is sent from client side...... brisfernando: 
solution: You can see the response also in the network tabPost  the response that u got from server side for your request...... No man.. I worked on a few forms that was for file upload as it wasnt working with template driven...the file upload package that i used worked for reactive forms.. usually for simple operations using template.... 

issue: In the following line of code in Angular: [<-LINK->] I'm wondering what the 'this' is referring to? 
solution: Could also be subscribing to a subject after the subject has been set. notflip: it refers to the current control. 

issue: Hey guys! anywone know how to fix the problem of spring security relation with /index.html navigation ? 
solution: 

issue: All you have to do is map your form in your post to whatever structure you want 
solution: If this is going to be a consistent problem because you are not mapping the viewmodel just make a pipe that loops through the object properties and replaces empty strings with null. i thought pipes were just for displaying values, what do you mean pipe that loops through the object properties. 

issue: anyone here to help in reactive form - with controlValueAccessor 
solution: how do i pass formControlName to the child componenthttps://stackblitz.com/edit/reactive-form-checkbox-v6because of that it’s not found the formControlName so it’s not updating the stateevent first checkBox which is retailerConsent working fine. But when i used custom form component then only it’s not workingand the reason is not getting formControlName in to the child component. 

issue: does your component have achangeOutput ? 
solution: FrEaKmAn: then I don't what you expect with(change)on a custom element. onchange is only applicable to inputs as far as I know. 

issue: @mlc-mlapis@ronnyekI would try this [<-LINK->] which has the same effect as the above package but I just think it's nicer 
solution: Frankly, the project I work on isn't super large, and even we ran into issues with memory leaks from leaving active subscriptions. I could only imagine how it is for larger scaled Angular apps.. I\'m not entirely sure what you mean by "forgetting or zombies" but basically we saw there were duplicated requests being executed as we navigated between pages. For instance, a service call would fire more than expected, causing a ton of issues with data being displayed. We eventually caught on that it was from subscriptions not being properly unsubscribed even after the component was destroyed.. 

issue: cause it's not in memory? 
solution: 

issue: guys, do you used lazy loading? 
solution: alexandrupintilei: if you know at design time that you will need ALL of the components in a module because they are ALL required to work with each other, then just put them in one module, otherwise, put each component in it's own module.. 

issue: Hi guys, any suggestions for the best architectural pattern for fast development with angular? 
solution: Or if you do use a generator :) Actually if fast development is at all a priority don't use ngrx. 

issue: does the route change when you click the router link? 
solution: who knows.... link. 

issue: Is there an easy way to track down where a ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenChecked is being thrown? 
solution: sometimes you can find the component in the stack trace. usually it's something like mutating values inngAfterViewInitwhen you shouldn't and things like that. dakotajd: i found, this usually happens when i mutated or changed data in ngAfterViewInit() lifecycle. Best is to move that logic to ngOnInit() instead. 

issue: E 
solution: 

issue: what would be the most fair questions to ask for an angular developer in an interview ? nothing too obscure, but at the same time demonstrate expertise 
solution: 

issue: I am doing this to add select 2 css  [<-CODE->] 
solution: it look like it is somehow preventing change event to get fire. If I remove this line of code, change event will fire but I will lose the css. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] - imported in your ngModule? 
solution: 

issue: Can I go for Modelling referenced relationship pattern considering fetching different data on same URL navigation? 
solution: 

issue: AndrewWeb-Dev: do you have any validators on the form controls? 
solution: That was exactly the problem@King-i...A form control value wasn't set...probably need a better way to handle errors there..ty again. 

issue: how can we implement push notification ? 
solution: coderishu: socket, or something like firebase?. i dont want anything like manually sending custom notifcation from terminal. 

issue: hey guys how do i choose a version to update in angular ? 
solution: but is it possible to choose ?. 

issue: what's the point of that pipe ? looks like you could just doobj1?.obj11?.b 
solution: 

issue: My goodness 
solution: Ohhh, like what kind of issue@King-i?. 

issue: ok real question guys [<-CODE->] OR [<-CODE->] OR  [<-CODE->] 
solution: I'd go with thesetterapproach, ngDoCheck fires too often, and ngOnChanges get's out of control over time.. idk about the actual use case as to why you need to do extra stuff on inputs tho. Something like a custompipemight fill the role better, but hard to say without knowing the use-case. 

issue: glasgowm148: probably the warning 
solution: 

issue: Do I need to run travis with --prod ? 
solution: I would just follow a tutorial like this. and get a minimial setup working [<-LINK->]. Yeh I did, works fine on a fresh install. 

issue: Did y’all know the@angular/corepackage has seen a 360% increase in weekly downloads on npm over the past year? That’s more growth than React or Vue! 
solution: 

issue: Hi everyone! I am working with rxjs timer observable to create a count down timer. However, I am not able to reset the timer. Could any of you help me with this? [<-CODE->] 
solution: The timer starts at 5 mins and counts down. It needs to reset when it reaches 0 and start counting down again from 5 mins. It can also reset if a user clicks the refresh button.. 

issue: This version of CLI is only compatible with Angular version 5.0.0 or higher. what is this error 
solution: blockmonk: Mismatch of version between cli and angular. 

issue: Is that your code? Like thats your actual source or is that Angular code? 
solution: Okey, I think its because ofnew Array().fill, fill isn't supported until chrome 45, according to MDN. 

issue: it says its a non module entity ie tsconfig. 
solution: 

issue: stop 
solution: 

issue: Hello.I get the value sent from other component withsubject.subscribe().But the value is then lost. Any idea ?Does it related tongZone? 
solution: 

issue: is anyone using a generic data table component with angular material? 
solution: piotr-mamenas: mat-table yeah. I am trying to apply an external filter do the datatable, i.e the markup is in a different component and just passes the filter value to the datatable component. 

issue: ... how old is he? 
solution: 

issue: How can I concatenate these expressions so I can apply a pipe? [<-CODE->] 
solution: @mlc-mlapis yes.. i want to concatenate the interpolation expressions and run them through a pipe like this: [<-CODE->] I am building this to see if it works.. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: that makes sense, it’s assuming relative to the component, if you want an absolute, you need to start with/. 

issue: 2 
solution: 

issue: where is fabien these days? launching more rockets i assume 
solution: seems a lot of the “old” folks are slowly disappearing. i know i feel like there's a hole in my heart now. 

issue: with angular http module ? 
solution: yeah and how are you consuming that observable ?. 

issue: did you restart vscode? 
solution: Yeah tried that, even tried a brand new application, upgraded the cli and angular to be safe. 

issue: A 
solution: 

issue: Hii guys i am getting error as Can't resolve all parameters for EditCopyPolicyComponent: ([object Object], [object Object], [object Object], [object Object], ?, [object Object]). any one have any idea ????????? no answer guysssssssssss ?????????? 
solution: 

issue: how do you like it for ongoing stuff? do you guys do large scale applications? 
solution: which I was able to get going with nx/nrwl, but I was worried that that I was doing something bad or preventing angular from being efficient etc. 

issue: Hi guys I am bit in dilemma as to when to use ngrx store and when not , can anyone give me a rough overview?? 
solution: AyzPat: It is not a question of ngrx vs. services. Using ngrx requires you to implment services. It's just a question of whether or not you want to use the REDUX pattern in your app.. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] whats the best way to do that> ? 
solution: If you need to have a function inside a class, which is not tied to an object instance, you can declare a static method like this: [<-CODE->]. 

issue: Hi folks, long time I wasn't there.... How can I define@Hostbinding(...)for transform rotate? :D 
solution: 

issue: yes ? href="https://external.com"? 
solution: It will be opened in a new page.. <iframe src="https://external.com"></iframe>. 

issue: Hi. Can I emit the top coordinates of a element using (style.top)="var" ? 
solution: manojvignesh: mm. viewChildren on the <ul> ? And then match the indexes from the message array to the list elements?. 

issue: Given that [<-LINK->] is now deprecated... what are we supposed to do instead? 
solution: damienwebdev: you can use inputs to pass down styles and classes and set them using directives like ngClass and ngStyle. If I have different "appearances" ofparentand I want to position child accordingly withdisplay:flexfor example, I have to do all sorts of odd work to wrapchildin various divs depending on the conditions of parent.. Whereas, if I just had the ability to breach the encapsulation, I could theoretically make it 10x easier to just stylechildin those certain scenarios.. 

issue: C ! 
solution: 

issue: Could also be that the width was a string? 
solution: allanwest: No, it's a number. Scratch that. thanks@allanwest. I made a mistake. Assange is a douche. I want the truth... now... not when he decides it for whatever his reasons are. 

issue: Probably some difference between the stackblitz setup and your local setup 
solution: where, on what route. There's lots of questions, and if you cant reproduce the same issue into stackblitz, then its not magic. It'snevermagic, there has to be a difference, if what you see is different behavior.. 

issue: Hey guys , can anybody help me out about which grid is the best enterprise grid  for angular 7 
solution: In short , which is the best grid for angular 7. but it doesn't have features like multirow editing ,column filtering , fixed columns. yeah ag-grid is nice.. 

issue: speaking of ivy, how does that play with custom build systems? Like... non-cli 
solution: mralbobo: it depends how crazy your build system is, I suppose.. 

issue: ... where is the typing? 
solution: 

issue: i never use JIT aot all day every day 
solution: carl-parrish: in my personal opinion, no. for development, i useng build --aotand for my remote/prod environments i tack on the--prodflag. i haven't had any issues with that, other than 5-10 second build times with aot using --watch. 

issue: EstevesDiogo: I would have a subject on the service to "communicate" between the component with the sidenav, and any other component on the app that wants to open/close the sidenav. 
solution: Usually you use it when Input/Ouput flows would result in prop-drilling, or relying on a common parent. The service approach is the most flexible, and the most powerful. Since your case could result in any number of layers of communication between your side-nav parent component and the component that show/hides it, using a service is really the only sensible choice :D. 

issue: exposing the subject came with a problem, binding to it is clumsy now 
solution: If I need[ngModel]="subject | async" (ngModelChange)="subject.next($event)". i need to set data in 1 component and get in another. 

issue: Would exposing aFormControlfrom a service be an antipattern? 
solution: if that service contains logic, does it has to be a form? can't the service be called with an object?. 

issue: can you do an oninit in a service? keeps yelling at me when I try 
solution: well then where can I use a activatedrouter then cause it sure at heck doesn't work in constructer. I think you'll get a stale snapshot doing that. 

issue: so I should be able to direct myself to a component? or does it need to be a module? 
solution: which is ''. so all urls resolve to that route. 

issue: So how does that work then? does that go in the app component html? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. I might say screw it to the dam data service and just keep getting it from the router, any down side to doing that?. 

issue: How to config mode-sql in ng2-ace-editor. I don't know config where. [<-CODE->] 
solution: Is it working if your remove the following line? [mode]="\'sql\'" //string or object (thx ckiffel). 

issue: :o 
solution: 

issue: torchie 
solution: he knows all. i know nothing. but you can be revived :D. 

issue: resolver might help? 
solution: You can technically use template outlets to solve this problem, but that requires the "projected content" to have knowledge of this template system. Meaning "it can\'t be done"... which is a bit sad. I\'d have to create the components dynamically with a factory I think. Which I can\'t do because that\'s too much of a change from how I\'m currently doing things.. 

issue: Hi Guys,I have deployed Angular6 prodution build in IIS, after that i am getting an error lazy load chunks failed in chrome browser, but if i do control f5 it is workingAny idea why it is not loading initially 
solution: 

issue: Just try remove {{country.country}} 
solution: i have to show country.country also but when i am selcting something so after that country name should not be visible. 

issue: what would be the pros and cons for the following implementations in context of dynamic component? [<-CODE->] vs [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] thats the error I am getting 
solution: use thetapoperator instead of subscribing to assign theresto yoursubscriptionUsersproperty.. generally if your subscribing in a method, but that method is returning an observable, you probably are doing something wrong. 

issue: G 
solution: 

issue: how to use axios in angular 
solution: sivagatti1: axios is a module that is used to create xmlhttprequest so it should be used at server side and not at client side..

issue: Any news on Angular 8 final ? 
solution: ngconf next week so  there they will be presenting the next future for Angular, I hope. 

issue: D: I don't have any :( 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] use an err and finally block 
solution: seems like you are probably approaching the problem incorrectly, is this json from an http request?>. 

issue: Wait, how many possible places could they be coming from exactly? 
solution: And eventually burn down the legacy apps one feature at a time until it's all in there.. 

issue: can you protect a module to get only loaded by admin? 
solution: but if user manually entered the localhost:4200/registration , he can access to that page. 

issue: You got a code snippet of what youaretrying todo?@SegiH 
solution: Then put it in stackblitz, pastebin. SegiH: ... simplify it for a demo purpose .... and probably you find also the answer where you have a problem.. 

issue: wasnt ivy and angular8 supposed to change some stuff around translation? 
solution: well I guess there ar e a couple things that really impress me with the angular i18n stuff. but most of it, I'd rather have somethign like ngx-translate. 

issue: inject the service into what constructor? 
solution: SegiH: ... there is certainly some serious misunderstanding - there is no limitation in Angular like this.. yes, injecting a service into it's own constructor will cause a circular dependency error.... 

issue: compared to what 
solution: 

issue: do you guys know how to use [<-LINK->] in angular ? 
solution: nadiaschutz: you shouldn't use that package it was last updated 3 years ago. nadiaschutz: score on here is usually a good indicator on how stale an npm package is [<-LINK->]. 

issue: does anyone here use angular material? 
solution: 

issue: Where do you run databases? Inside or outside of Kubernetes? 
solution: one thing is that it makes it easy to spin up and down whole applications since they're self contained. 

issue: wont that new const have both _id and id: 
solution: As an example think about your personal website where you want to show your projects and also display information from your GitHub profile.... 

issue: I have no idea why, but HttpClient get isn't working for me at all 
solution: well until you subscribe it's not going to do anything. 

issue: any one using drag and drop apis here? 
solution: sliceofbytes: got it, they have a method called reset which resets the position. yup, just call reset on the dragInstance.

issue: I didn't understand what is lean component? 
solution: 

issue: What does iRobot has to do with that ? 
solution: mralbobo: You were right. Not many get the reference. You mean I, Robot. I get it. I was thinking in terms of iRobot lol. 

issue: right ? 
solution: 

issue: event.keyCode==13 is not working? please help 
solution: mlc-mlapis: ...It is not working. Can you please give a look in the above given stackblitz link.. 

issue: what is this for logging of some sort? 
solution: 

issue: Is there a good way to check in angular if an event was fired by user action or programmatically? event.isTrusted always returns true for me regardless of source 
solution: I have my (blur) and (keyup.enter) handlers executing the same code (ultimately, an XHR). my keyup.enter handle is also programmatically calling blur() which also triggers the XHR because isTrusted is always true for some reason. 

issue: 1 if you're using the cli 
solution: but the consumer of the lib brings in either the main module and therefore all submodules, OR preferably just the submodules it needs. DefeninMaxime: No. I mean, if you use the commandng generate libraryto generate a library, it will create the library's main module. You add modules for each component you want to put into that library and import the component into it's respective module. You import all those component modules into the library's main module. Later, when you want to use the library, you import only the modules you need from that library.. 

issue: always worth mentioning too that direct dom manipulationusuallymeans there's a better way to do it in angular 
solution: far as I can see, you haven't explainedwhyyou want getElementById. So... no ideas to provide. (I'm heading out though, so nothing else from me today). mralbobo: I want to get the elemenyById so I can remove the row from the table after I press the delete button.@alxhubI tried adding an id='item.id' to the html, but it doesn't really appear in the html.. 

issue: What if he means localStorage on the "backend"? :D 
solution: 

issue: so angular 8 is gonna get released today? 
solution: 

issue: Anyone ever had a problem with not committing package-lock.json? 
solution: 

issue: i saw that fugwenna: learns all about c++ 
solution: *ngIf. 

issue: Sounds like you installed a newer version of rxjs where they must have removed it ^^ thats probably why 
solution: Toxicable: I did not install an older version of rxjs. Just changed the import paths. Toxicable: i have been trying ag-grid out but the things that is annoying me is the pagination stuff… or lack thereof.. it seems like they removed traditional paging in favour of infinite scrolling. But I have grids where a user will click on an item and get routed to a detail page and if they click the back button I want them to see the list as it was. 

issue: Hi guys! Is it a good pratices to inject a Service in a parentComponent then pass it to his child or is it better to just inject it in every component? 
solution: Either is fine, just depends what you prefer and what is cleaner in your scenario, if my child component was going to have to have like 3 event emitters just to call functions on the service I'd just inject the service into the child component if it's just one or two inputs I'd just pass the values etc... 

issue: the function I have that does that was called getNested, no idea what the actual term would be 
solution: and doesn't convey fully what the function is doing. someone other than fabian convince me not to make this decorator i want to make because it's the cleanest way i can think. 

issue: So I guess this is what I am trying to do. [<-LINK->] 
solution: Bakuryu: httpreturns an observable which is not getting awaited or subscribed to. Eric: so who needs to subscribe to it? How do i store it?. subscribe to the call then pass the value to your state service. 

issue: Is it possible to have a sub-module with components that share some complex data?  So they can all access the same Person? 
solution: many components would do something like I'm a complex tabview or something that requires state management (not saying you need ngrx or anything). 

issue: Can someone explain to me why these people don't have loops?  [<-LINK->] hm okay 
solution: @lwensveen ... you can ... just need to pass the UI filter params to the correct places ... and your UI always got already filtered data.This still doesn't help me, I need to filter on a event from the ui, so I can't filter it in the service. 

issue: this won't change anything 
solution: but then it still loops. are you once again emiting inside your subscribe. 

issue: why do you want to do that? 
solution: 

issue: same for me 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Here's a minimal reproduction of the issue: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-zxutbkGot any ideas? 
solution: vivekpatel5996: I've faced this problem and trackBy resolved it. It's must be because of the way angular uses to identify the changed element and re render only changed items. We're passing around primitive boolean in the nested loop so it'll be hard to track it compared to object whcih can be tracked with reference. By using trackBy we're providing angular a way to track entries in a unique way.. 

issue: when/how  do you get the error? ng serve 
solution: found it. i use mat-checkbox. but for some dumb reason it gives this error: TS2339: Property 'source' does not exist on type 'MatCheckbox'.. 

issue: Guys, I have one question about routing and lazy loading 
solution: 

issue: Have you tried npm uninstall rxjs? And then npm installrxjs@latest? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, Hostbinding and ngClass? still not possible? :D 
solution: Mikosko: I don't see how that is possible. HostBinding is to bind to the component whereas ngStyle binds to a child of the component in the template. 

issue: how can I prevent this pop up to come automatically?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: I want to trigger it when I click on take a selfie button. 

issue: what\'s the equivalent of*ngIf="!(maybeObservable$ | async as ob)"? 
solution: everything works swimmingly when at least 1 navigation event has occurred, but otherwise, when the user loads pages directly, all the rxjs goodness is late to the party.. 

issue: filesaver? do you mean [<-LINK->] 
solution: yeah. well have a look at [<-LINK->]. there is a demo using a local textarea. 

issue: Ping the person who asked you to make changes? Who asked you to make changes?

solution: like <a href="www.google.com" target="_blank" >. AsifKha04393981_twitter: like this: <a href="www.google.com" target="_blank" >. 

issue: So return false for the guard but then also tell the router to navigate in the method? I can make that work. 
solution: i usually do router.navigate and then return false. 

issue: i can confirm that about the UrlTree also can return a promise might be 7.

solution: and it's not to replace them. babeal: core for life!. 

issue: I miss AngularJS... where I didn't have to compile an compile into an compile 
solution: you don't compile, your processor does. it's not like you need to pedal a bike to spawn electricity for it.  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] jitCompilerFactoryInside Ivy: Exploring the New Angular Compile.

solution: If you're looking into putting something on your resume to upgrade your career, then make something.  Even something fake, but step up the scale with each iteration.  Employers love to see your own work.. 

issue: Preloading is exactly to solve your problem. Loading the lazy module will take time so it's better to load them before user navigates to it in background. But loading everything at first using PrelaodAllModules won't help as it affects initial performance 
solution: 

issue: what i'm here and now i'm not! 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] What is the most standard way to do this ? Mmmh, found [<-LINK->] 
solution: AdrienHorgnies: There are really 2 broad approaches, either "emit" to the parent, and have the parent "handle the state" for the two components (passing the required state down to the child component(s))oruse a service to hold the "state". 

issue: hey everybody, how can I change a default port number, instead of typingng serve --port #XXXX? 
solution: IsaakNazar: use this [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Hi All, I am using the Angular Material Stepper component - [<-LINK->] . I am trying to find a way to handle the click event on a step. The API does not mention a direct way of doing this. Any help is appreciated! 
solution: broweratcognitecdotcom: The click event is handled by the material component within the stepper <mat-step>, I was trying to find a way to get access to that event.. 

issue: Hi there. I have an HttpInterceptor to refresh an expired Token. How can I ignore this request from being intercepted? 
solution: jocelynlecomte: My interceptor checks if the token is expired and if it is it asks the api for a new token. This refresh request also runs through all the interceptors. It works but somehow some request does not end since a progress bar does not stop. I was wondering if it is because of it running through the interceptors again. 

issue: Is there documentation anywhere for creating a builder with the@angular-devkitpackages? 
solution: 

issue: heya everything alright? 
solution: Haha. Just wanted to check if I could help anyone out. 

issue: Ah I was wondering more so about having it automatically update the form control value to be all upper case without needing to subscribe to the changes and do that JS. Kind of like how formatters existed in angularjs 
solution: I know i could do something like (i don't remember the exact syntax off the top of my head)formcontrol.change.subscribe((value) => (formControl.setValue(value.toUpperCase()but i was wondering if there is a good way of intercepting those changes with a directive placed on the input instead.. 

issue: so , effective, efficient and affective are synonyms, correct? 
solution: Uhh no. ghetolay: hahah. ghetolay: heh, thx. ghetolay: I guess you are an affective teammate :-). 

issue: anyone uses webstorm? 
solution: I have this annoying thingy that when I want to add a import. it always includes these typings as well. 

issue: why should this be a problem? you can provide a spy service and UI components don't have to be dumb IMHO 
solution: and don't say hate and test in the same sentence. Where I work this is a no go, no matter how reasonable. 

issue: oh god please no 
solution: no. no cucumber. yes. yes. aarrrgh. 

issue: Anyone got any tips on how to approach reducing a 10mb application to a more sensible size.. started with check rxjs operators etc 
solution: lwensveen: You could use lazy loading, to split into less components size. Analyse your bunndle size with tools like webpack budle analyser to find more with vendor package is two big.Check for some vendor package that was really big, like loadash, graph library etc.. And try to import anly a subset if available. Else if a library is two big and you couldn't only load a subset, try to load this library after. When needed.. 

issue: ... the typing is also highly related on how the back-end API was designed ... it can be terrible but also very nice to work. 
solution: lwensveen: ... I mean that the API and data can have a clean structure but also there are cases when the API was written without any concept. 

issue: Hi, I am using jsplumb. I need to create jsplumb diagram in SVG Fromate.Please suggest me what can i do 
solution: 

issue: Hello,having such code: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: NomNomSu: first of all, don't mix reactive and template approach, you don't have to bind ngModel to input... u should use [formControl] and pass an instance of FormControl. you don't have to bind (click) cause you can subscribe to form value change. so it should look something like [<-CODE->] items is form control group of form controls. 

issue: How Can we hide query string parameter in url? 
solution: while routing if we pass parameter in query string it displays in url. 

issue: HI guys,I have some data I need to get from a website, how can I do it? I want to use something like this, but I dont know how to implement itthis.https..get(this.url[‘var'); 
solution: OkI have an API in PHP, using PHP I called $_GET[‘variable’] and I get wharever I want as long that global variable exist on the LAUNCH URL, the Launch URL is not relevant, just POST the informationBut I actually need that information in the frontend, I need to read it from the frontend and not from the backendI develop this tool as an external tool, when I should have done it as full integration from the beggining. 

issue: DId you provide the module for the service? 
solution: you need to import it to the module, not the file. See the first code snippet on the docs I set for setup. adding it to the top of the file allows typescript to know what your talking about, but Angular (which is throwing the error from its DI handling) doesn't know about it. 

issue: How do i connect a printer to an angular app 
solution: 

issue: best way to sum multiple inputs in a reactive form group with onValueChanges? 
solution: bori87: You want to add them together mathematically?. broweratcognitecdotcom: yes i want to sum all fields if any of fields value changes. 

issue: you need a longer name@cfagudelo96 
solution: no reason.. just cuz it's so long already.. I like it. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] overkill but might have some good info 
solution: ngrx just helps to keep everything in one happy place :D… remember redux isn’t good for making simple apps…it’s great at making hard problems simpler. 

issue: hi everyone,I have reactive form like this: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: amr-alamir: If your going to "push" the entire object into the entire form, usepatchValue, it will add the values into the form group intelligently. I believe so,exceptif your array is empty and the object/values are adding has say 5 elements,they wont be addedsince the group doesn't know what the sub-groups look like. 

issue: Is there a reason that a behavioursubject could be abruptly finished and restarted? 
solution: I would guess your either re-instantiating it or its throwing an error. 

issue: how to get which component  i am in ??????????

issue:  [<-LINK->] What's this for? I just import my library module into my app.module and it works fine 
solution: lwensveen: when you want to have components that are not for any specific feature, instead they are reusable components. 

issue: why cannot iterate over keys of Map instance in template:*ngFor="let k of map.keys()"? 
solution: isevcik: or if the map changes over time (if it is an input for example), you can make a function that returns the keys and call it in the ngFor. 

issue: I know this might seem rude@arifk2but the best way to start is with [<-LINK->] staying up to date is not hard start with version 7, which is the current one 
solution: after that, search for a while in Medium for articles that catch your attention, because there are many things that are kind of hidden, and if you don't know about them you might end up implementing something that works, but that could had been built better and more easily using something already included. 

issue: can anyone suggest something ? 
solution: cholexa: yourresshould be type odResponse. cholexa: inside a pipe do this [<-CODE->]. it does not go to catchError. 

issue: Anyone familiar with ngbootsrap ngb-tabset ? 
solution: It seems like there is some hidden nuance of how the tabset works that is evading me. 

issue: how do I embed an image? 
solution: 

issue: electron?? 
solution: 

issue: o.O? 8.0 is being held up so that 9.0 can be released? 
solution: 

issue: Hmm anyone devide deeper into angular elements and free for a chat? 
solution: santoshyadav198613: due to the fact that there is no threading here, can i PM you - i would understand if you do not want - it\'s not at all sensitive or such, but it\'s really hard to have a "chat about one topic" in here, which does not bloat the channel or gets hard to read anyway. Let me know. santoshyadav198613: in any case, what i have is a dom-tree which has several non nested components. What i do in my bootstrap i usually put them all into one zone and bootstrap them using the app-factory + appref.bootstrap(component) right now. I wonder if elements are actually able to help me here  - it seems so. So spreading several angular components, non nested ( not even tested into the same root app ). 

issue: Yes there is,@lazarljubenovic damienwebdev: afaik, last time I checked (~1 month ago) TS still had the blocking bug. 
solution: 

issue: is there a way to conditionally apply an http interceptor? 
solution: yeah. 

issue: lol 
solution: i am getting undefined in this way. but when i am using "function" instead of arrow function its working fine. 

issue: Hey guys someone can help me with this [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: anyone got any tips moving from webstorm to visual code? 
solution: it adds these [] at the beginning and end, but then you cna't see where your cursor is. 

issue: Isn't this NodeJS ? 
solution: But we have to discuss it in the right place, don't you think so ?@mijatovicmile. 

issue: how can I fix this error?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: manojvignesh: , No. these all are my imports. From those links it looks like rxjs is not installed. 

issue: changelog still says rc5 
solution: yeah I think that would be a ngif on the p. I wonder if ngx-datatable is a bit better supported today. I remember complaining about something that to me seemed very much like a bug, and a bunch of other people voted the same in github. 

issue: so basically  if I have  some components related to products , there should be a module containing all the related components inclusive of models and services  ? 
solution: 

issue: Wait the auth guard is the one returning false? :o 
solution: and then i was going to set auth to true. hmm..i see there is also a canLoad guard. 

issue: Have u tried elementary os? 
solution: I've seen people implement logic in guards that does stuff like if token is expired or invalidated, delete token redirect. 

issue: there hasn\'t been a single "i use arch btw" joke? 
solution: 

issue: ng cli: is there a way to change something in webpack config without ejecting it? 
solution: Because I just read that an office employee moves the mouse over a distance of 6km  per day :D. 

issue: me? 
solution: 

issue: So, what is the final solution I am researching about ignoring requests in interceptor 
solution: I think solution 1 is nice.. (I never used this api until now, but its a JS thing, not an Angular thing). 

issue: what is the server? I know with c#, you can configure cors and tell it to do all kinda different thins 
solution: ronnyek: best scenario would be display the list, and then fetch the files from the urls and attach the blob as imageBlob key. you can treat a response binary as a blob and use that as the source for html image. 

issue: hi all I'm trying to upgrade from angular 7.2.15 to 8.0.0 with command ng update @angular/core @angular/cli but i got this error  [<-CODE->] How can i upgrade? 
solution: @thanhngvpt >when i upgrade my 7 to 8 yesterday XD i just use npm-check-updates then add {static: false} on every view child else it will throw error xD i read that lazy load stuff doesn't accept strings anymore.. [<-CODE->] importing via string is deprecated xD  kinda lazy to change all of those loadChildren xD  maybe soon if its really a goner also the typescript needs to be 3.4, when i install 3.5.1 it throws error..btw just backup yout proj and try to follow what consoles want you to do.. disable the warning... 

issue: hi, how i can add class to element based on ngfor value === 0? 
solution: 

issue: are you both using the cli? 
solution: i always load relative from component path, it always resolves.... RigaNik: then what you use instread of jQuery in angular projects ?. 

issue: can you provide small stackblitz example? 
solution: values is being referenced in my template. 

issue: the use of dynamic forms is to reuse the repeating formcontrols am i right? 
solution: Not always. I use it just to add validation to single form controls.. 

issue: wait what who can't be trusted angular can't be trusted? 
solution: I interviewed at a place that wanted to use React because they "didn\'t want a framework". 

issue: Anyone know how I can setValues on a formGroup 
solution: and I can't pass typings to formBuilder. When using the setValue() method with a form group or form array instance, the value needs to match the structure of the group or array. 

issue: is your token sensitive information? 
solution: there is no password and sessions. I guess if no, I can save token in localStorage. 

issue: can u please share the  code ???? 
solution: 

issue: If I have a parent component with OnPush and I want to use 3rd part components as children with Default change detection am I doomed? 
solution: I would assume the third party component will handle change detection correctly, regardless of what change detection the parent component uses. 

issue: Hi, I can to have a form Control where the validators are executed onChange, but the valueChanges only is throwonBlur 
solution: @jocelynlecomte This is one part of the template where I use the formControl relationed: [<-CODE->] And this is the component. [<-CODE->] Then I want that the validators of field 'cantidad' to run when the field changes, but the valueChanges only run when the value lost focus.. 

issue: I really love how angular cli upgrades everything so smoothly [<-CODE->] 
solution: alex88: you lucky :-). EdwinSilvaDK: it was a joke because I told him to install 7 and it installed 8. 

issue: Is it better to use<ng-template>or content projection via<ng-content>as a general rule of thumb? 
solution: 

issue: Anyone got a small project which has a Login and Authentication system (which judges whether an account is an admin or normal user) that I could have 
solution: Cycho-Entertainment: So like you don't know how the auth setup will go at all? I'd say use some third party login, but it depends on your app requirements. Something like github or google auth is secure, and you don't have to worry about passwords and what not. Then you can think about how your going to handle the user's session (so the server knows who is making requests), so either you save that info on the server (sessions) or use something like jwts. 

issue: Is there a faster way, other than@Output, to call back into the host component to get a piece of info?  [<-CODE->] I want to comment out:  [<-CODE->] and uncomment the commented code above, but this causes unacceptable performance problems. 
solution: cfagudelo96: My component used to determine 2 things internally. active and visible properties of the content object within. but that was wrong. it needed to emit events and let the host component determine that. But when I added the Outputs as shown above, it degrades the performance. So instead of using an Output, I gave the component an Input that accepts a callback, and this works without the performance problem.. 

issue: Anyone know if there is a way to circumvent relative paths in libs generated by the cli? 
solution: When I make a lib, as described byng-packagr, it appears all references within the lib have to be relative (excluding those fromnode_modulesimports).. 

issue: Is there a way to have a module throw an error if it is instantiated before a related static forRoot method has been called? Preferably during compile time? 
solution: I have a bunch of autogenerated api modules that require stuff like apiUrl, timeout config, etc in the forRoot method. Sometimes I get people who import the module in a lazy loaded feature but don't check that the api is setup in the root app first.. 

issue: How is that related :)@ghetolayi just want to load module 
solution: 

issue: any thoughts on that [<-LINK->] ? 
solution: kuncevic: premature optimization :-)?. GoNode5: just want to minify html files though but the solution I found just does not work. GoNode5: haha. 

issue: this doesn't really make sense to me 
solution: shareReplay is an operator like map, filter, switchMap. obsv.subscribe( /* here you define callback to react to emission/error/completion */)obsv.pipe( shareReplay() )here you create a new observable resulting from the composition of the original obsevable and the operator you've piped in. 

issue: vscode? 
solution: then people show me a setting. doesn't exist for me. 

issue: anyone update their ngrx yet today? 
solution: No, was just going to see if anyone else had issues before I updated :). 

issue: sure, what issue are you having with flexbox/css?  [<-LINK->] something like that 
solution: 

issue: I’m having an issue. 
solution: if you want the scrollbar to show when there is overflow then overflow-x:auto; if you never want it to show overflow-x: hidden;. I don’t mind it being able to be scrolled.. 

issue: what is alternative then ? ReplaySubject ? 
solution: 

issue: can someone please help me with this [<-LINK->] 
solution: I have subscribed to an observable and whenever it emits value I push it to array that is linked with lists on template. 

issue: Has anyone used Stripe in Angular? 
solution: Corovino: have you used in plain javascript or a wrapper?. I have found this one [<-LINK->] but can't style it.

issue: Number('xxx') != 'NaN'   ? 
solution: seems to cover the cases I can think of. 

issue: with ivy 
solution: ivy. fugwenna: flashes cool colors. and with an echo. ivy ivy..ivy...ivy..... 

issue: What's the problem? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. this works but not as expected. because modal from the second subscription is displayed multiple times. 

issue: Anyone else has problems with watching applications and libraries since one of the last updates? 
solution: "serve:all": "npm run start:beheerportaal:stag && npm run watch:portaal",. 

issue: anyone use vs code to work on angular? 
solution: This syntax requires an imported helper but module 'tslib' cannot be found.is basically all I get on my angular project. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Why do you need to unsubscribe in this example if you havetakeUntil? I was under the impression thattakeUntilreplaced the need to have anunsubscribecall..? 
solution: It's from this article [<-LINK->]. 

issue: yeah he became a bit of a hot head when he stopped being a dog 
solution: he was much more fun as a puppy. take the hint@fugwenna, though it's more of an observation... 

issue: i hate that error i've gotten better at avoiding it 
solution: fugwenna: In some way I actualy love that error, haha.. Even tho I don't think that should matter, but I'm wondering if you're emitting to the store when the input updates ?. 

issue: i still use it manually 
solution: I am dealing with some error but not sure why, something likeBUILD ERROR\nCould not resolve './lib/directives/mouse-wheel.directive' from some/project/path/esm2015/projec-file-name.js. 

issue: Anyone got an idea of how to change a Material Dialog background? I want to change it to a single background-image. 
solution: Cycho-Entertainment: Like what do you mean by "background" like open a dialog that just shows an image nicely? You should be able to open any component (say an image component) that can do that :). I wanted something like an image of the bitcoin currency as the background-image to a modal component but by using thez-indexI should be able to pull that off? As its literally a window for registration.. 

issue: Can anyone help me getting this stackblitz to work? [<-LINK->] 
solution: yeah... but adding the polyfills as suggested in the ticket does not help either. 

issue: does anyone used AGM angular maps before?  i have a problem when  render poligons 
solution: sliceofbytes: no is a ussue, i have to set a number inside the polygon to make more easy the indentification of  this poligon  inside the map cuz i have many. Corovino: I think you would probably use an infowindow attached to the polygon for that. 

issue: Hey guys what is your opinion about this rule in the styleguide? [<-LINK->] 
solution: Corovino: Don\'t prefix output properties.I\'ve been reading some issues about inconsistent behavior when an output matches a native DOM event. So I\'d like to know what would name a "click" output emitter in a custom button component for example. 

issue: Hello, trying to detect a change in my ViewChild, Is one of the lifecycle function good at this? 
solution: 

issue: ?? last version is 8 
solution: but which one is good and stable to use in project. I don't see any reason to use an old version if you're starting fresh.

issue: using angular 7 facing an issue with throttling navigation while using canActivate / canLoad guards on routes , any way to fix it..? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Is there a way to make an overload or some other way makepathparameter optional ? 
solution: sliceofbytes: that method exists in the abstract class for controller. If you do not provide path it requesting controller directly. For examplelocalhost/usersis a path to controller to GET query it you have togetRequest(""). 

issue: hey, is there any way to update a dependency without recompiling the code? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] <<< 
solution: I really cannot place a Guard for every route in an enterprise app with dozens of them just to make direct URL access work. 

issue: How can I remove the packages I don't use from an Angular app? 
solution: grrigore: can't younpm prunethem and then fix up the errors in the files. just make sure you have a working copy in source code (git). 

issue: depends how high up the chain the module was being reloaded and of course things like implementing proper routing stuff help there eg, selected tabs are reflected in urls modules and view components module is unit of code that can be loaded/unloaded lazily 
solution: 

issue: ?

solution: TimMeissner: ... I never used upgrade path.. 

issue: what is the difference between injecting service through DI asconstructor(private elementRef: ElementRef) {}, and injectingInjectorasconstructor(private injector: Injector) {}and calling.get()in constructor on injector as [<-CODE->] 
solution: RigaNik: The first is the best practice. The second is when you need finer control over what and how things get injected. If all you need is to use a service provided in 'root' just inject it.. A module that lives in a library and contains a component that implements ControlValueAccessor must import FormsModule in order to use ngModel in the component that includes said component.. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Any way around this? 
solution: ghetolay: Whoa this works! Amazing!One other thing i fixed is that my import was sometimes going toapp.config.service(.ts) and sometimes toapp.config.service.js.. 

issue: Anyone have a solution for a DOM change insidesettimeoutnot being rendered/updated in the view? trieddetectChanges,markForCheck,ngZoneand what not... 
solution: but the rendering is based on factory generated components which are attached to dom dynamically.. 

issue: Anyone have a better way to write this function? [<-CODE->] 
solution: @lppedd I tried that.You should be able to extract the object class' typeThis step doesn't work post compilation.. 

issue: data? for the instance of the component? 
solution: like@Input() prop or any sort like that. you get the instance back fromcreateComponent. 

issue: It's how we do it, in our app initalizer we do a fetch for the config file 
solution: it'll make you inital render slower, but that can be mitigated by pushing the file down. Most people use anAPP_INITIALIZERbecause to even load a Login component you need to Auth URL. If you're lucky enough to not need to block for the config file, because you use an app shell pattern, thenCanActivateguard usually works fine. If that doesn't float your boat, then calling your AuthService from the root AppComponent::ngOnInit would do. 

issue: hey everybody, what type it should to be? onSave is a function. [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: hello any 1 can help me regarding  caching 
solution: sliceofbytes: i have menu bar and now i am hitting api again and again to get the data from inside so its taking time to load.

solution: mlc-mlapis: slides.filter((slide) => slide.type === ‘0’. That is what I had to do! But thank you though!@mlc-mlapis. 

issue: whats up 
solution: 

issue: delay? throttle? debounce? 
solution: I am subscribing to an array of observables in a list and forgot the array.forEach is blocking. So delay should delay the next subscription in the forEach loop. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] lwensveen: 
solution: Check the sanpshot. I don't know what I should do with this. I getthis.modalRef.content.closeModal.take is not a function. 

issue: hello anyone alive here? 
solution: no im dead. 

issue: I have a server that POST a json, how can I read it??? 
solution: AI have RestService that read JSON from the backend, but I need to read it directly from the frontendI have tested using this website, https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/42 and I can read it, but I dont know what to read exactly from the website, how can I find out?. 

issue: Can I check if the component which I'm navigating to has finished loading? 
solution: bradtaniguchi: I use router.navigate. When the promise ends it means that navigating is finished, but is does not mean that the target component is fully initialized. 

issue: Hi how is everyone doing? 
solution: 

issue: I'll give it a go 
solution: location of the base index file. 

issue: Ok so it's loading my Index.html but no webapp? 
solution: But if I go to the Elements tab I see my Angular tag for the app <scope-webapp>. 

issue: Can anyone give me more information on why it spits out multiple files? 
solution: 

issue: hello no man but can you help me with my code ? 
solution: i using ionic 3 with angular firebase now I getting an error says:. 

issue: Hi, I wanted to ask whether we can use jquery AJAX inside Angular? It errs and gives this ->TypeError: $.ajax(...).done is not a function 
solution: lwensveen: Actually this is a hybrid app with AngularJS too in it. And using $http in the particular scenario creates a circular dependency. That's why we have used jquery. 

issue: Pretty good, how about yourself!? 
solution: 

issue: morning 
solution: lwensveen: yes. and the error of course. 

issue: Are you referring to the catchError section@darinalleman 
solution: 

issue: build per lang? yeowch 
solution: I mean it makes for optimal load times because its not always dynamically translating things. I feel like with how ivy is going to change things... i18n stuff could be optimized quite a bit. 

issue: I don't have a single unsubscribe in my app..when do you need it? 
solution: http calls should get cleaned up. I avoid subscribing manually. yeah if you can use a async pipe, you are better off. 

issue: hi, what is wrong with this commented snippet?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: can angular-cli be invoked with a different configuration file than angular.json ? 
solution: and even use a custom builder, if needed (the same way nx integrates nestjs, react etc in angularcli). 

issue: Done that@manojvigneshThanks :) I am starting new project any advice how can I get some cool design with out touching much of HTML part? 
solution: Yeah I mean I want some module or a way to create good design.. I can take the help from designer but I wanted to do it on my own... 

issue: any one help me to put a  range slider on angular 2? 
solution: KishanIos007: i try the <ng5-slider> for sliding purpose.it works fine.i want an alternative on angular 2.. so far I tried:firebase loginfirebase login --no-localhostfirebase login --reauth. 

issue: Are you learning because you are working on an existing project? 
solution: 

issue: how do you export from stackblitz to a working project in your own CLI 
solution: That way you're not fighting version issues etc. or just go through the process of creating the parts and then copy in the relevant bits of code. 

issue: ng build 
solution: 

issue: hey, i was just looking at those docs at angular.io 
solution: i assume you dont' actually use that. 

issue: hi may you help me please 
solution: lisacopeland: actually i have a form in html where all the value are of string type and one input file is also there for image .. 

issue: you may need the types for d3 irc 
solution: afaik, no, i think vs.code uses the types to help infer all of that stuff, YMMV, i could be wrong :D. hmm isee@hungerregnuhthanks <3. 

issue: what do you mean lazy loaded modules locally? 
solution: I read that I could use Ivy, but that looks like a long road from my quick test.. so you have a module you typically lazily load. 

issue: can i combine angular 2 app with android app and run in android studio? 
solution: there nativescript allows you to build angular apps in a sort of angular fashion. 

issue: Post or Get? 
solution: Put. timothyblue: Is it clear what I wrote about dynamic import yesterday?. mlc-mlapis: Sort of :-) I don't know how to actually implement that.. Looks like I need to implement ngfactory somehow?. 

issue: do you turn on OnPush ? or disable CD? 
solution: we've never had a problem around that stuffWe did have a issue with perf at one stage, so we just turned on OnPush oin all our lib components and it fixed everything. setTimeout, or injecting cdr and trying to call all the methods within, or inject ngzone. 

issue: guys how does one unit tests this ?  [<-CODE->] 
solution: jimrock20071_gitlab: in your test case you can assign an Observable created withoforfromto activeBomOfSelelectedItem and afterwards callsaveForm(). jimrock20071_gitlab: Is the class where the activeBomOfSelectedItems property exist calledsubjectin your test? If this is true then yes. You can do it like you proposed. 

issue: ivy? 
solution: 

issue: Can anyone let me know if this is the right way to create a spy onservice?  [<-LINK->] Getting the following errorTypeError: this._ajaxService.post is not a function 
solution: 

issue: hey, what do you think of this [<-CODE->] 
solution: Corovino: If this is code you found, I'd assume its laziness. There is no reason to use promises if your using Observables in Angular.. 

issue: ...like thisshouldpause execution yes??(async () => {console.log('hey bozo');await this.someobject['key'].promise;console.log('mind actually awaiting?');})(); 
solution: I object to your use of the term 'laziness' - it carries implications of 'sloth' and 'lack of forethought'. There are two good reasons not to, one is because it would be simpler to re-write, or take a long time to do so, the second is because something simpler is desired or there is an alternative already in place (above and beyond observable or promises). The way you put it implies you think everyone should use Observable or they're just, you know, so much trash.. 

issue: ye but can i use my this.isAuthenticated$ inside my filter function ? navItems(): any{    let isLoggedIn;        return this.navigation.filter((item) => { [<-CODE->] } smthing like this this is not working of course 
solution: Razgort: usually the other way round,this.navigation$ = this.isAuthenticate$.pipe(map(isAuth => this.navigation.filter(....)));. 

issue: its a shallow copy of the elements in the array to a new array. So if you copy over an array of objects, the new array has the same reference to the original objects. 
solution: 

issue: I'm interested in when there will be a date range picker like in [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: manscrober: steal it from Airbnb, they steal enough as is.. think the den of thieves is a React shop, but maybe it will give you some ideas.. 

issue: Hi there ! Did anyone upgrade from angular 7 to angular 8 ? 
solution: you could try forcing it, personnaly I had to change one of my packages which wasn't supported. If it's the resize event you could try to imprlement it yourself@HostListener('window:resize', ['$event'])\nonResize(event) {\n  event.target.innerWidth;\n}. 

issue: some parent between body and HomePage needs overflow: hidden 
solution: 

issue: Anyone got any tips concerning datepicker/ localization? I use the material datepicker, but I got to format some date strings so I can send them to the backend 
solution: Wed Jul 24 2019 11:35:22 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time). 

issue: question anyone here 
solution: wanted to know how to set a header. 

issue: Hi all, please help me fixing this issue - [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: I mean I guess the cross-interactions problem affects all "major" web frameworks, and vanilla web components right? 
solution: Having Angular interacting with React components, or React components interacting with Angular components, I don't think either process is that clean/easy right?. 

issue: haha augury is a love hate thign for me 
solution: in change detection mode onpush, do getters and functions called from templates get called non-stop like they normally do?. 

issue: Still can't get my module to load correctly.... Anybody look at my gists? :) 
solution: Remove the resolver from the route in question and see if the error changes. 

issue: Hey! How have u been? Not around too often.... 
solution: So far so good....haha... I like to work more with angular out of my full stack...So trying for that..for now more of spring rest blah blah.... 

issue: Hi. Can I make the onSubmit function async? 
solution: 

issue: did you include it in your module? 
solution: include the module in the module of the component where you want to render it. 

issue: is EmployeeModule a module that lives completely isolated, or is is also used as a route? 
solution: 

issue: how to resolve this error?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: I really think handleError has some problem with generics 
solution: argument of type 'true' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Payload_Response'. 

issue: run ng update with --force to get rid of these warnings 
solution: I think the angular-cli is not compatible with the version of@angular-devkit/build-angular you have. 

issue: Anyone in here using Protractor (6) with Angular 8 (hybrid)? 
solution: 

issue: const headers = new HttpHeaders({ Authorization: token }); 
solution: theDPlayer: If you have the private keyword in the url you don't add theAuthorizationheader or is your code not working like this? Because it actually looks like.. actually I do not want to sendauthorization:tokenif theurlhas private keyword but still it is sendingauthorization:token. 

issue: what is that... cypress or somethign? 
solution: but I get the most bizarre issues. I avoid karma/jasmine stuff like it was the plague. 

issue: give the component a template variable and pass it to an@Input, or... see here: [<-LINK->] 
solution: he was telling me about how there were ways to simulate a intelligent template without requiring the component itself, but I dont receall the details. 

issue: Toxicable: are you here ericmartinezr: are you here 
solution: 

issue: can someone tell me how do i display my store value in html  [<-CODE->] this works perfectly 
solution: if I inject this service into my component like: public localeService: LocaleService then I can bind to the current value like this in my template: {{ localeService.getCurrentValue | async }}. I come from redux background. There, i used to put this.state.number and voila the value get displayed. 

issue: hmmm do you have onpush on the component ? 
solution: 

issue: Are you using the Angular framework? 
solution: 

issue: yep that should be it 
solution: 

issue: manage?? 
solution: You want to get theTopicModels[]out of this??. I want to get an observable of topicmodels. 

issue: How do you pass the styles from CSS-assets (from an angular material theme in my case) into a lib? How do I access them via JS? 
solution: philly-vanilly: you cannot access sass via js, unless you use some custom loader config with the bundler. lazarljubenovic: then what is the material recommended approach to deal with this problem? I assume styling libs is a common use case and you should not rely on ::ng-deep and inline styles for that. 

issue: Hi anyone worked on internationalization in angular 2+ ?  I need help for translating dynamic content. Any reference/help will be of great help? 
solution: DanielNetzer: . I would like to build such an history component so that I can add moves (in FAN, I mean with the chess symbol for the algebraic notation), and so that it is decoupled from the board it should control. 

issue: any library we have which will convert 1 => One or 2 => Two and also have localization support? 
solution: broweratcognitecdotcom: for that we have to add in language json file.. but cant we do at run time as user can provide any number. But it does not support Finnish and Swedish. 

issue: Inside an event handler? 
solution: Creating a directive/component that binds to a service would make sense. The documentClick handler would call the service to hide the dialogs. 

issue: How do I pass that response to the component for display? 
solution: throws:.  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: did you try setting it through the cli? 
solution: no change. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: N 
solution: 

issue: I think you can? can't you just use the pipe to say i'll take one of these types 
solution: I can understand the argument, but I wouldn't say it necessarily says its bad. if you focus is nothing but js and typescript... I could see how people could make that argument. 

issue: Anyone using bluejeans, zoom, or other comparable software for mid to large size video confrencing? 
solution: lots of remote people and sometimes as many as 100 people in their meetings (for big corporate announcements etc). 

issue: I don't think there is anything wrong with method overloading but I do try and avoid operator overloading like the plague 
solution: I mean I get that method parameter overloading doesnt work because js is the way it is. you know whats fun? Implicit operator overrides that do lots of work, and are damn near un-detectable as a hit in performance. 

issue: K : 
solution: 

issue: Morning 
solution: lwensveen: this is my personal account. sup. 

issue: why do you want to do that? 
solution: 

issue: Hello is anyone good in named router-outlets? I have a problem with them reinitializing the parent component every time i go on the named router outlet..  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: I tried like this, still rerendering parent.public navigateTo(): void {\n    this.router.navigate([`.`, { outlets: { 'addLicense': ['test'] } }], { relativeTo: this.activatedRoute});\n  }It's like it's detecting url change and childCanActivate is refreshing everything.. it shoudn't rerender.. it's useless then to have another outlet... 

issue:    :D 
solution: 

issue: How are you navigating to populate your auxiliary routes? 
solution: to some degree be treated as a default value..... 

issue: angular cares for safe html, doesnt it? so when using<div [innerHTML]="text"></div> and text is a user input i do not have to care for XSS attacks, do I? 
solution: Last I checked Angular wont render unsafe HTML, unless you explicitly tell it to. But in that case itdoes nothing, so you have to handle it yourself. This is off the top of my head tho, I'd read the docs about it. 

issue: 1 
solution: 

issue: True, would@ViewChild(MyComp)be considered more idiomatic given the type safety? (legitimate question, I'm still learning) 
solution: antch: You would only need to use the@ViewChildbit if you want your component code to able to interact with the template reference variable.. antch: both approaches have type safety, the template approach would be checked with aot only, so you wouldn't see issues until you actually tried to build the project with aot. Generally which is easier to deal with depends on what your actually doing.. 

issue: any one ? [<-LINK->] 
solution: looks like some bugs in your circle class but the push should be fine. 

issue: This guide explains how to customise the available variables at a global level: [<-LINK->] 
solution: Angular components have the concept ofview encapsulation, and it is turned on by default. That means that any styles in<name>.component.scsswill only apply to that specific component.. If you want to specify classes that can be used across different components, there are a few different options see the last paragraph in this guide: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: o.O you ok over there dora 
solution: Tpp. I got to lock the screen. 

issue: guys, do I need tounsubscribeanything at all? 
solution: The template automatically subscribes and unsubscribes when doing it this way. I prefer this since it’s very clean. 

issue: delayingbinances$variable? ah, no, I just tried it and that's not what I meant  [<-CODE->] this part is being rendered slower 
solution: (binances$ | async)apparently this is working like creating a new variable or something. 

issue: At this time, i just know that routerActiveLink class binding is make during ngOnChanges() but i don't find any information about the order of this hook event regarding Router events 
solution: lazarljubenovic: I have subscribe to NavigationEnd in my navbar component to add/remove a class. But i have a problem. I'm not sure is because RouterActiveLink added class is not already in the class attribute at this moment or something else.... 

issue: I wish I didn't have to support IE at my job. BUT I do.Financial institution? hahaha 
solution: for state gov. IE11 and over. 

issue: how do i get current component's elementref? that is, the host element? oh right you inject it i was looking at decorators... 
solution: There are also decorators the lets you add more specificity, like@Selfor@Host, but I've never used them on Components.. Freak, it was working until last friday, than I upgraded to the latest CLI release and now I get names like [<-CODE->]. 

issue: what is good/bad practice? 
solution: 

issue: How would it treat it as a boolean when you're not passing in a boolean? 
solution: but you're passing a string. Unless I\'m mistaken,someProp="false"is just a string.. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] guys, why are those services working when I inject them even after I remove them from the list, they work (that's my CoreModule btw) 
solution: This feature was added in ng6, and makes creating global singleton services easier and basically hands off. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] i think my visual studio is drunk 
solution: 

issue: angular/angular#32219 
solution: So it's going to be opt out isntead of opt in then?. In v9, for apps we hope Ivy will be the default, yes.. he's building like Angular that renders inside a chat bot or something. 

issue: can we have submit for each formgroup in formarray? 
solution: lppedd: take in consideration this gdoc [<-LINK->] if you try ivy , and this gdoc [<-LINK->] if you don't know how to config ngcc file or if lib you are using is not present on this doc, try to contribute and add more config that work for you. 

issue: Hello, what is the best way to intercept an event triggered by a child component in an ancestor (not a parent) chains theemitfrom child to parent then from parent to ancestor ? use a service with a subject property that is update by the child and listen by the ancestor? 
solution: 

issue: github code of what?? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Have no idea what's wrong honestly. The Module is pretty standard [<-CODE->] wendzhue: Just seen you're here too, so why not tagging. Hope it doesn't bother you 
solution: 

issue: Afternoon all! 
solution: Night!. 

issue: hello? 
solution: 

issue: Anyone using Firefox version higher than 60? I'm trying to confirm that I have the same problem as here [<-LINK->] 
solution: But in my opinion, ti make no sense to use Angular Elements in an angular project. 

issue: Lazar knows all that lazarljubenovic: 
solution: you literally have everything except angular. 

issue: Hi All..Is it good practice if i put my endpoint routes in theenvironment.prod.tsfileSomething like this [<-CODE->] 
solution: sreejithgk94: In the authService...I imported the envitonment module...assigned it to a variable then did something likehttp.get(this.evn.BASE_URL + this.auth.LOGIN_ACTION)i just wanted to be sure if this makes sense or I should just put the routes in the service. 

issue: the constructor isn't the right place to call functions 
solution: yeah found it. then after adding stuff to the calendar. call. 

issue: I'll reiterate, maybe someone knowsLet's say I have common functions in a separate TypeScript file, and I use them around my Modules, how are they compiled? Where are they placed in compiled code? 
solution: Toxicable: because they get minified, but it would be interesting to know in which bundle(s) they get placed.Are there conventions/rules to optimize the usage of common functions? (not using modules). 

issue: which version of typescript? 
solution: ronnyek: I started using it, but I'm waiting for v4, which will be out shortly with breaking changes. 

issue: how do i extend configurations in angular.json? 
solution: apparentlyoptionsis supposed to be a global config for all configurations but that's not working at all. i mean having two similar configurations and just overriding one thing. 

issue: no idea why it's prefixed withdefault~but eh, does it matter what its name is? 
solution: i extended a directive and the ngafterinit is not called. 

issue: why would you build apps for different locales? 
solution: jesus. you create different 'apps' (hashes) for different languages?. 

issue: Anyone know why the followingjasmine-marbletest fails? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: 1 
solution: 

issue: Hmm I'm running into issues using jest for my Angular project, anyone using jest around here? 
solution: bradtaniguchi:. ronnyek: I think I figured it out, basically came down to how this [<-LINK->] didn't work how I expected it to. I wasn't able to specify my angular project jestconfig, it always blew up. 

issue: is there an "assert(myArray1.length === myArray2.length)" in angular? to make sure that I get a compile error if the assert fails? any way i can cause a compile error if some value doesn't equal a given value? 
solution: 

issue: What is the best way to change views without changing the route?My angular application is going to be executed as a widget inside a iframe 
solution: lets say I got a property that I split up into a getter and a setter. I was wanting to have a hostbinding on the getter, and a input on the setter... but angular complains about having decorators being applied to multiple get/set accessors of the same name. 

issue: Why r u unsure 
solution: they may or may not come. In item.. And then use the operator outside for control. 

issue: why the setter/getter ? 
solution: 

issue: P 
solution: 

issue: I dont know if I understand, you want to conditionally apply a ngif? 
solution: I know if I stuck an *ngIf on the div with wrapper class, it'd hide the child elements too. I believe for this the wrapper should be a component and you probably wont use ngif to make this work. I know I could use ngifelse and duplicate the child content with the wrapper in one of the conditions. 

issue:   a A 
solution: 

issue: o.O 
solution: 

issue: What is the difference betweenloadChildrenandhasChildrenin Angular routing? 
solution: bradtaniguchi: I saw that in a project. I don't think it exists in Angular. I think they created a custom class or something by inheriting it from one of the angular classes. Idk.. 

issue: ecuanaso:  [<-CODE->] 
solution: prog20901: it's a multi-step problem, indexing your documents in whatever search provider you chose will be step 1. 

issue: hmmm are you injecting httpClientModule in both your app and library? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] ? 
solution: 

issue: hi all 
solution: bbmattieu9: what is your stack? I think your question is too broad and there could be several ways to do what you're asking. For example:  your API call to update an avatar, you could trigger an event to change the image based on what the user has just uploaded.. 

issue: anyone got chrome remote debugging working on mac? 
solution: i have a hard enough time finding an RDP client for windows->mac. that doesn't lag like hell. 

issue: Hi All. I am playing with latest Angular 9.0.0-next.4 with Ivy enabled. During the build process, I see below message "It is not recommended to publish Ivy libraries to NPM repositories". Anybody know why and what is the proper way to share ivy libraries? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] why is this not possible? 
solution: It says Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type 'MyId' can't be used to index type 'Record<MyId, string>'.. 

issue: hi guys,  [<-LINK->] how to resolve this type error? 
solution: 

issue: Hey anyone here ? 
solution: no!. fugwenna: hides. turn the lights off. so he can't see us. 

issue: Anyone here handy with dates? 
solution: and I get this. TS2367: This condition will always return 'false' since the types 'Date' and 'string' have no overlap. Alt+Shift+Enter Alt+Enter. 

issue: i'm not here 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] +1 
solution: If you need variable go with class...only problem is multiple inheritance is not possible then..so u have break that into a class and am interface. 

issue: is this pattern wrong? Validators.pattern('^[A-Z]{4}[0-9]{1}[A-Z0-9]{6}$') it is accepting last character only digit shouldn't it be alphanumeric? 
solution: shekharramola: yes... can you give an example of what you mean by 'accepting last character only digit'?. shekharramola: well, works for me. It could be the value you eventually pass into is is different... maybe some whitespace?. 

issue: 1 
solution: 

issue: I think that dog must be awesome too xD (because all dogs are? ) :D 
solution: you know nowthing eric the drug dealer. that's it, guys, this is how we stop the overflow of issues and prs: just close 'em without looking. 

issue: the tsconfig's paths entry is the only thing that controls the module name 
solution: and the generated file from the module that imports it locally with the unscoped name. 

issue: can you turn on source maps so you can see what fn is calling it? 
solution: Toxicable: I imagine that's doable. But as I said the error's happening during routing resolution loading a module dynamically. I can make that much out.. The route is defined thus:{ path: 'useraccount', loadChildren: 'app/user-account/user-account.module#UserAccountModule' }. 

issue: awww 
solution: ericmartinezr:. there's a lot of mutable shit on FormGroup. addControl. 

issue: Ooh. Ivy is faster 
solution: Toxicable: I have a table with an expanded component. I don't like how it is done, it loads a bunch of dropdowns and stuff even if it isn't opened, and was slow, even with paging. Noticable difference with ivy. There are some changes to the dynamic component insertion that may make it easier to create one component and use it on the opened row.. 

issue: I trying to create simple extension methodhere is my definition [<-CODE->] And this is usage [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: ZBAGI: Right, do not extend by prototypes. This is more native development in JavaScript. One reason is that "FormGroup" is not the type "FormGroup" anymore. You modificated it. If you need it, create a new custom one with a extended class e.g.. ZBAGI: No also in JS theFromGroupis not theFormGroup(of Angular) anymore if you modificate it or add more stuff. In JS you just don't see this problem. It's generally not recommended to modificate existing classes. Also never extend the Number, String, etc. predefined stuff of JS. It's a dirty way which is dangerous in code. btw. method names should be camelCase not PascalCase. If you really want to extend the FormGroup you should create an own class and extend the FormGroup. ... btw. in your case it fails because exeuction order as Lazar wrote. This is an unconventional way to do this.. 

issue: what about strings starting with  '//' ?  :) 
solution: jorrit-wehelp: yeah, if you look at the two benchmarked variants they're basically equals. 

issue: what's the confusion here ? 
solution: well, it's not an interface.. calling it an interface while it's and abstract class ?. I guess it's been used by DI. 

issue: To the RegExp gurus. Can I join those tworeplacecalls? [<-CODE->] 
solution: There is not really an option to combine two diffrent actions. You can create regex that will match leading/or multiple//but then they both will be replaced by one think. 

issue: o.O

issue: hi i have an angular universal app,i update the body class sometimes in a component like [<-CODE->] but now when loading via Angular universal.. it doesnt remove the body classs, as if the component is not destroyed why? it does add the body class 
solution: it happens becauseI route to localhost:4000/app (behind login)\nsite gets loaded via Universal \nisAutheticated function (guard) fires on route... but isPlatformServer... always return false for isAuthenticated (because we cant sessionStorage yet) \nuser gets routed to the login (localhost:4000/auth/login)\nSPA is loaded, sessionStorage is checked... so routes to /app\nauth components does get destroyed (and document is defined). 

issue: Are you sure the route in question has children? 
solution: 

issue: happy to help, but have you read the docs yet?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: This seems to explain things fairly well: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: can you show some code? 
solution: ngAfterViewInit() {this.canvas = new fabric.Canvas('bb');}. i have to add Hostlisterner to the function to trigger click, such as@HostListener('document:mousedown', ['$event']) testClick(). i use fabric.js to control canvas and install the corresponding dtypes. 

issue: 0aaa Typo 
solution: To checkout on the angular charts. I forget to close that window and move to another app in mobile. And also forget to lock the screen and subsequently press on some random keys.

issue: how can I avoid this scenerio? 
solution: 

issue: Who uses conventional / semantic commits here? Is there something that annoys you about them? 
solution: DanielNetzer: I use them too, I find it\'s a bit "harder" to type in the type and subject (when needed). I\'m building an IntelliJ plugin to simplify writing conventional commits (directly inline, no dialogs as others do), and wanted to know if it could be beneficial to share. 

issue: any ideas on how to make it more DRY?  [<-CODE->] same here :  [<-CODE->] any suggestions? should i just create a class and then add extra fields if needed? 
solution: nadiaschutz: create an array of these tings and just select the elements from your array based on your condition. @nadiaschutz In those long and complicated objects you have some base properties with the same values. You can create an object, then something like this: [<-CODE->] If you have an object with data where the same one is used, const commonobject = {...} create it once and reuse it.. 

issue: Anyone on here have any experience with AngularFire? Would you recommend using it? 
solution: documentation is obsolete and it's really hard to understand how to use it. it's very disappointing since I enjoy Angular and Firebase so much. 

issue: send me your code@jeserkin 
solution: 

issue: .pipe(map(data => doSomethingWithTheData(data)).subscribe(...) ? 
solution: 

issue: na, that will run in 2.7 just fine 
solution: @fugwennaI didn’t need to click that link to know; lmao. 

issue: ok, is there a keydown event that is fired before the value oftrueis passed to the directive ? 
solution: IonutGI: hmm no. and see is something is called before ngOnChanges. 

issue: M 
solution: 

issue: I have a lot of trouble understanding what a decorator is and why we use them. I just recognize that inside of them I use them to specify the name of the component's slector and template location. Can anybody explain what decorators are and why we use them? 
solution: RayGar: This a doc for decorators in typescript in general:. I think the why is best answered by:Decorators provide a way to add both annotations and a meta-programming syntax for class declarations and members.. 

issue: Can you nerds work faster on 9, please? 
solution: I was gonna make you do it, but I have to honour the unbreakable code of no u. bluebaroncanada: you're welcomed to contribute to make it happen faster.

solution: 

issue: Just updated from angular 5 to 8. Build itself seems fine, but the cli crashes on processing jsons….  [<-LINK->] anybody knows what to do? 
solution: 

issue: why would you generate an angular app with visual studio -.- 
solution: rickvandermey: yeah seems to defeat the purpose in most ways, but the previous devs were not that great looking at how it's structured, and how it was created, but at least they got something done. it works, for the most part.. 

issue: I 
solution: 

issue: yeah, dropping the styleUrls and making it global.... but what's the real problem on why you want this? 
solution: shouldn't that work out of the box when you use universal>. 

issue: Is it a bad practice to use result of function call as data-binding? <test [size]="getSize()"></test>andpublic function getSize() { return \'large\' } 
solution: that shouldn't matter much, its just  the function will be called every round of change detection. So it could be pure, but be called a lot. So making sure it isn't CPU intensive is important.onPushchange detection should help as well, but the component might not work the same with that on unless you set it up that way initially. 

issue: is that element outside the <app>? 
solution: 

issue: Any experience here withngx-translate?Shall Iunsubscribe()fromObservablesor the method is called implicitly ? 
solution: Or it could be in one place. What I mean by that. You subscribe toonLangChangeon outer/master component and inside when lang changes you just update title by using angular service for page title [<-LINK->]. 

issue: So if I inject ServiceA into ComponentA and ComponentB and specify 'root' it will refer to one instance of ServiceA? 
solution: tjowers95: You can provide services/injectables in the component decorator itself, so each instance of that component will have its own service instance. You won't see this pattern that often though. bradtaniguchi: I see now, so typically the service injects itself into the module, so that means it's instantiated once and is passed to the components class as a reference, however a component can instantiate the class as many times as it wants within it's constructor or methods, although this isn't ideal probably because of memory management and confusion. 

issue: can I use ngif with ngswitch?  [<-CODE->] it is  throwing an error. seems like it will not allow? 
solution: shekharramola: Are you saying that when the callbackEvent emits, getLoanData is executed, this will set the loanData on the component and make it defined... You want to only show the app-emi-calculation-screen in that case ? I don't think that's working, co zthat means that, prior  to calling the output and setting the data, the element will not be rendered ... Hence the output will never be triggered and the data will never be set.. 

issue: not all :D 
solution: 

issue: what 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] what should be the opposite of this? 
solution: but the only thing I added is bestandsimport/. and all of a sudden it has some massive issue. lwensveen: as I said, path resolution is top-to-bottom, so place the most specific paths on top.. 

issue: it would render the same way, assuming its not dependent on properties of the current dashboard component and if it is, you can give it the properties viaInput and bind them what do you mean what about them the new component will needng-contentin it's template for them to show - look up content projection in angular 
solution: I want the dash to appear on most of the pages, it's a navbar a side bar and a little expandable chat button on the bottom right, should I wrap that around the components that I plan to put in the center. 

issue: apfranzen: What do you want toconsole.log? 
solution: bradtaniguchi: or JSON.stringify(model) - I just want to confirm that the data is getting to the component. 

issue: Hey guys, are these two behaviors equivalent? [<-CODE->] and [<-CODE->] 
solution: In the second case you will have an empty div. So basically what I am asking, is if it is considered okay to replace the  existence  check of a parameter through *ngIf with just a ternary operator. 

issue: Well the partial issue is, that our translation team doesnt look at any json, but just adds 1 translation in n-Languages at a time by specifying the key as "some.weird.place" and all the translations. So that would mean creating 5 translations to build 1 sentence 
solution: But it\'s just one sentence. Not multiple sentences that would make sense to be split into different parts. Translations might even get worse as the translator might not realize the context in which one word is inserted later on. It doesnt even render differently except for being underlined or not. And as i said as soon as some idiot comes up with "Wait, in this language we should change the order of words" and just does it and all the links are in the wrong places.. 

issue: Hi...Please suggest me why Angular 5 application is not working in Internet Explorer 11 ?

issue: language 
solution: I wonder what people think about@fugwennabeing called doggo :P. it makes no sense if you don't know the history of@fugwenna. and what a long, rich history it is. torchies history can be summed up in one line… he once was a dog, now he’s a torch. 

issue: o/

issue: Btw all these people gave permission to share this picture 
solution: Yessiirr. Oké, wanneer begin je bij ons?. 

issue: what issue are you having 
solution: lazarljubenovic: the named router outlet doesnt populate, but the route does appear to be defined properly. 

issue: :D 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] 
solution: zzj0402_gitlab: you need to have a body for the ngOnChanges function. 

issue: Anybody could help me with that problem? [<-LINK->] 
solution: broweratcognitecdotcom: I have no other service - just started my frist angular project and got this problem. The target domain is actually protected with basic auth because its under development. So i had to find a way to access that in my app.. 

issue: The emoji is not really good tbh, once I was asked why I was slapping people... and I was like "wtf..." 
solution: well, who actually waves as a greeting in real live... more common as a goodbye ;p. 

issue: How is everyone today? 
solution: Life is good. Finally heading back to the US. 

issue: London for Angular Connect, then France to meet with a few of our team members there, then hanging out with NativeScript in Bulgaria 
solution: lazarljubenovic: actually I was quite keen on venturing over to Serbia and sightseeing a bit, but I didn't have the time (nor do I know anyone there). 

issue: how are you guys ? 
solution: I've finished an editable table implementation based on ng-zorro and I'm TIRED. That's bromance. 

issue: 21:00 here Hhhh 
solution: Soufiyan07: wow, country?. morocco :). I am just 4 months into Angular. 

issue: what other metadata could there be except the template? 
solution: also lifecycle hooks. extending a component withngOnInitwont call it properly. 

issue: Library support for NGCC is the biggest potential blocker for upgrading to Ivy. 
solution: sharikovvladislav: there are a few things in angular, I found some things with material that i didn't do correctly, worked before but didn't work with ivy. Not too serious. The issue is third party libraries. I think it has more to do with the build than the actual code.. 

issue: I think the code is fragile for issues indeed. But good that one is solved@ctfrancia!! 
solution: If you want to avoid calling the method, you can use a pipe.. 

issue: hey fugwenna: how are you ? 
solution: pff naw. 

issue: Anyone got any tips on debugging 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys I need some help with a problem I am stuck at. Basically I am trying to trigger an animation on a button using the state change of a variable say animationState, which is set to 'initial' and is changed in a callback function of a video timechange event. The animationState variable is set to 'final', when the video reaches 10s before the end.I console logged the animationState variable it is showing correct value as final when video reached the trigger point. but the same is not reflected in the view, means the animation did not trigger.The other day Someone suggested the ngZone.run() approach . It works but the problem is, it sets the video to 0:00 again.can some one please direct me to the solution ?  I am ready to share more details on this one :) anyone ? I think everyone is pretty busy today :D 
solution: so basically, We have a video that has some duration say 90 seconds. Video has a 'timechange' event. I have assigned an event handler to this. It fires every 3ms. So wanted a button initially disabled to be set to active after an animation triggers at a certain point before the video ends. We chose this trigger point to be 10 sec before the video ends. So now, When a video plays and it reaches say 80s It triggers the button animation( which gets triggers based on a value change of a variable say animationState from 'initial' to 'final'), We have this variable set to 'initial' by default and change it to 'final' when video reaches the 80s point, for example. This variable reflects the change in component.ts file (I console logged it, show 'final' after the trigger point 80s). but animation does not triggers. But If I put the variable assignment code animationState = 'final';  inside the ngZone.run(()=>{animationState ='final';});It triggers the animation, but the video that had to be kept on playing, somehow resets to 0:00.I hope it gave you some clear idea.. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] and in my parent component, I can set what that dynamic-component is 
solution: Like there are a number of different options on doing it, but it depends onwhyyou want to have a dynamic component in the first place. Like you could use*ngIfs*ngSwitchthe router, or actually [<-LINK->] but the last option is the most complex, and also the most powerful. 

issue: what is dir 
solution: does it matter what it does. rude. 

issue: Regarding the last link, does the name on the app and the backend have to be the same? 
solution: At least the part that's marked as Update Angular >= 6. 

issue: what issue are you referring to ? 
solution: 

issue: Nice, I'll have to keep matrix params in mind next time I'm building a new app what is your use case for them in the app you are building? 
solution: 

issue: So you're saying you can reproduce it without the subdomain they are refering to@jeserkin? 
solution: Domain does not matter. Just the fact, that it is build for prod.. On a weekend or later today I will try to make a repo withREADME.md, that explains how to reproduce.. 

issue: Hi there! I am new to gitter. Not sure how this works but we help each other here. if i am right..

solution: 

issue: I'm using ChangeDetectorRef to trigger changedetection this way [<-CODE->] magic don't happen. :-/Is it normal that my cdRef's  _viewContainerRef property is null? 
solution: 4javier: in my experience it does. use patchValue, it is less fussy than setValue. setValue needs the object properties to match precisely the form properties. 

issue: Is there an anuglar way for bootstrap affix? Mmh it seems like sticky does work, but only if I remove a overflow somewhere in a class lol but this are more CSS questions, sorry for bothering 
solution: jancoow: i would always do it css way if there is any... if it solves your prob, great, if not, it's pretty simple directive that could be made for your case... directive that listens for scroll and adds class to DOM is pretty easy, no need to use anything external for that purpose. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] But I get this error: Type 'Observable<Object>' is not assignable to type 'Observable<void>'.\n  Type 'Object' is not assignable to type 'void' 
solution: 

issue: <any> 
solution: 

issue: Does any one knows how to execute any js function after structural directives (ngfor) ? 
solution: iammohsinar: Angular should automatically be running change detection for you (if using default change detection), you also shouldn\'t "update the DOM" with Angular, its job is to abstract that job away from you. 

issue: i want a store management in angular for that i did npm i@ngrx/store 
solution: gatti_siva_twitter: That is a long complicated discussion. There is an ngrx gitter for that. 

issue: Q 
solution: 

issue: how can I test media queries in angular? 
solution: cahergil: as you would without angular. I haven't got experience in testing outside angular. there\'s a "test" method for queries i thought you were referring to that. 

issue: so add it? 
solution: It was supposedly added in angular 7.2... [<-LINK->]. lets you put [state]="{foo: \'bar\'}" on a routerLink and retrieve that object in the routed to component. But it doesn\'t work as far as I can tell.. 

issue: I would import the module with.forRootin the lazy loaded module, making it "the root" for that module 
solution: ekarlso: When we build on our CI/CD (google cloud) it appears as if it gets stuck on that part of the build (building of the es5 bundle) but it just takes a long time. We ended up turning off source-maps and license extractions to save time. 

issue: does typescript have extension method support? 
solution: Well, you can extend the prototype. But no real support. Not like C Sharp or Kotlin. 

issue: Hy, is there any expert in service worker? 
solution: 

issue: Quick question, I'm not an angular dev. Can I edit client side form validation? I'm looking at a site with the wrong max length for a field. Tried changing that value, but it didn't work 
solution: 

issue: lazarljubenovic: I love you  you should totally be Google's CEO 
solution: lppedd: My personally guess is because of my response here: [<-LINK->] that both Eric and Lazar are against. But I\'m probably just inflating things. I\'ve been left to believe both Eric and Lazar believe in "fixing Google" as they both had strong reactions to the OP issue\'s if updating the documentation to be more inclusive. You can probably guess where things are going after that :). 

issue: hey how can i the password field be cleared after an unsuccessful login attempt? 
solution: are you using Angular reactive forms?. angular reactive form. 

issue: how do you like it so far? 
solution: that is an understatement. Well.. you have an entire chatroom of people that think/thought the same way :P. 

issue: module level template ref? 
solution: eek a getter in anngFor?. fugwenna: changedetection.onPush. 

issue: I'm trying to reduce my angular app bundle size webpack-bundle-analyzer tells me that all rxjs operator are in the bundle 
solution: 

issue: Ive got places that use renderer2... is that going to magically break when ivy starts becoming more mainstream? 
solution: if I say cloned a bunch of angular tracked components, what is missing from the wiring to keep those components from firing events, and updating like they normally would?. 

issue: Is angular ivy ready for production? 
solution: have 2 objects like this:export class Card {  id: string;  name: string;  desc: string;  dateLastActivity: string;  idMembers: string[];}export class Member {  id: string;  fullName: string;  userName : string;}i am get it from api. i need to create table like that:<clr-dg-row *ngFor="let card of cards;">    <clr-dg-cell class="width1">{{      card.dateLastActivity    }}</clr-dg-cell>    <clr-dg-cell class="width2">{{ card.name }}</clr-dg-cell>    <clr-dg-cell class="width3">{{ card.desc }}</clr-dg-cell>    <clr-dg-cell class="width4">{{ member.fullName }}</clr-dg-cell>  </clr-dg-row>. 

issue: So how is the CSS setup? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: danilosilvadev: Should be like<a [routerLink]="[\'/auth/google\']">Login with google</a>. i did change, is not giving an error anymore. But still, the button does nothing. danilosilvadev: if it gives you  an error it means you didnt import router module properly. 

issue: did you import 'rxjs-compat'? 
solution: if using rxjs, i import that.  they have a lot of aliasing going on between them.. Where i need to import rxjs-compat?. 

issue: is that intended to be a setter? 
solution: if I had my druthers I would have angular use in instead of of for *ngfor hahhahah. 

issue: where are you implementing 
solution: hmmm, not to familiar with material design :(. who knows how can I solve that. 

issue: Ok so Flutter is to Dart what Ionic is to TS+Angular for the most part then right? 
solution: i think NativeScript supports Vue. 

issue: Hi there, is there a difference between the two here? [<-CODE->] 
solution: TonySpegel: I don\'t think so, but I advise to use the "highest" level, as you could end up getting it from the more specific path and it changes later. 

issue: You need a backend service to send an email. 
solution: which one do you recommend?. JNerisGit: if you want the typescript one [<-LINK->]. JNerisGit: somthing like this [<-LINK->]. then yeah your angular form will collect the data and post it to the endpoint that will send the email. 

issue: Question is, why would Google create a new language (Dart) if it could just use a tighter JS right? Why invest? 
solution: Also google has averyquestionable record of making stuff it doesn't really need. Google is a big company, there's heaps of stuff happening that other deparments don't know about. 

issue: does anyone know how to share tsconfig across multiple projects? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] .filter does not exist on type unknown 
solution: arbaaz360: no the error is saying .filter does not exist on a type of object '{}'. 

issue: Is there any way to run angular 8 in the browser without node, typescript, etc. like you can with AngularJS? 
solution: you can define how it is transpiled.  so maybe you don't like it all being packed like it is.  you can create a tsconfig that may be what you are looking for.. 

issue: I'd like to create a little service to provide modal window: is it acceptable to pass a ViewContainerRef as parameter to a service, then call createComponent inside service's init method ? 
solution: 

issue: is that a angular attribute like injectable 
solution: i know just kidding around@Toxicable({ mustard: true}). 

issue: maybe my question is more... can I compile a component to a format that would allow it to be dynamically loaded say from a url and just work? 
solution: 

issue: But what is wrong here? 
solution: 

issue: M 
solution: 

issue: How to show placeholder value, when we use ng-select?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: amishacodoxy_gitlab: make an option with no value and disabled as the first value. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Is there anyone who can answer to my question ? 
solution: 

issue: Wrap it in a div and get the offsetHeight and offsetWidth of the div? 
solution: I mean that the height is wrong either way.If I set a Div with a width of 1280 I wouldn't know the videos height beforehand. TonySpegel: he means make div height auto, then measure the div's height. 

issue: Hi, can someone please tell me any angular open source project to contribute. I am a beginner. I have not committed anything to any open source project before. 
solution: Palapapaa: ,@ericmartinezr,@lazarljubenovicbrothers i am working on an open source project for peoples ease, i am new on angular, so its kinda dificult, but its my own project so i want it to complete in some months, its a good startup, also i am unable to enything to anyone right now, aso its your choice if someone work with me on it, yes i am new but i am problem solver, so its dificult for me at this time but not impossible. so any one who wants to join me in that please message me, i am ready to start an JointVenture, also if my startup goes good, you will always be a part of that project ever. Thanks, Ahtesham. 

issue: there we go, the question in SO about router and rewriting route - [<-LINK->] this is the second day I'm trying to solve this! :( 
solution: alvipeo: It's likely not matching any of your routing, so falling back to default. If you have a default route like{ path: '**', redirectTo: 'home' }change it to something invalid to see if it's getting hit during the redirect. 

issue: why does router have scroll events 
solution: I just noticed with tracing on, router is firing off events when scrolling. I was curious what the use case is for changing a route or something when scrolling down.  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: do it onmain.ts? app initializer? 
solution: well the app initializer run only with the minimal necessary required code, so that's your best bet. the other way to handle this is with a simple middleware html/js page that only check for the token and if its valid and that redirects from there. you can still extract the main module as a lazy loaded module, but there has to be initial module holding the application core with the simplest component to bootstrap with. 

issue: Hi@sliceofbytesI have one question about dynamically create  autofocus after step by step 
solution: so hoe can I create dynamically autofocus in angular application so at time only one field is autofocus  and doesnot affect to other element of that array. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] why doesn't this work? 
solution: I know. just like you can dostyle.colorup there. but you either define a value to it or you use it. 

issue: during build? 
solution: queuing a new build typically fixes it. I know its blasphemous, but I wish node was like not a necessary evil in anything. 

issue: how can i make angular component inline? 
solution: ArbaazJalil-gep: Inside your template use <svg> svg markup </svg>. 

issue: Why not initialise the variable as false ???

issue: How can I hide month arrow, next and previous button arrow of angular material calendar ? I used display none thing but it distorted the calendar 
solution: cant think of many places you'd want a date picker or calendar thats fixed to exactly one month. 

issue: you're trying to split a string that's undefined? 
solution: then assign empty string. lwensveen: @mridul037Check if the variable is actually a string? Thats all its telling you. lwensveen: use flex man!. 

issue: M 
solution: 

issue: 2 
solution: 

issue: That's not how you want to use height 100% 
solution: You have a parent of  height 500px, if you add a child with 40 px and a child with 100%, that's more then 100% in total which is a little weird.. 

issue: P 
solution: 

issue: php is a service side tech server you can have that script sitting on a server and have angular do a httpget or something 
solution: but call that php url like and endpoint from an angular service that return and display me html code. I'd expect you to be able to do a http get with content type for html, then render it in a template (probably after passing it through a sanitizer). 

issue: Ok so essentially you get 1 observable (the object), and for "stuff" in that object, you make other "requests" via observables to finally get an array? Right? 
solution: 

issue: also who cares how many people are using itmake your own decision for choosing a framework, don't rely on popularity 
solution: I feel like I chose it for tooling,maintainability and learning curve reasons... but had always wished it was more performant and smaller. 

issue: wow angular 9 is already on rc2? 
solution: 

issue: In the latest Angular connect they said that they have now over 1500+ Angular projects internally. 
solution: There are exceptions, like parts of the Google Cloud console have angular 2+, most is AngularJS. On Linkedin, Indeed, etc. Angular and React were about the same in terms of jobs in 2018 (and Vue was like non-existent). I guess it didn't change much. But the npm download count methodology got changed during spring (I think) and shows bad stats, no idea why.. 

issue: honestly, I wonder what products we've ever heard of from google actually use modern angular I suspect that will get better with ivy and stuff like that 
solution: I just know if I tried to build something like even say gmail in angular, I wouldnt be able to get it to perform anywhere CLOSE to as fast. 

issue: how can I fix the 'Cannot find control with name' ? what should I do? ? 
solution: 

issue: a hello? 
solution: 

issue: happy friday 
solution: noice. 

issue: anyone else has the same issues ? 
solution: I also started a new project a month ago and had the same issue. it is strange.. i know it is really frustrating. but you'll feel good when you don't have to experience the issue.. 

issue: is there any benefit in learning webpack if you are working with angular cli 
solution: danilosilvadev: Hmm, there are two options. Either it is something trivial which you just don't see, it happens to everybody, or it's something with your infrastructure and which is not directly related to Angular itself at all.. danilosilvadev: I saw your conversation above, but it's a typical example of a huge discuss without touching and seeing the real - live code. You can discuss hours but without success like that. I prefer to verify the basic building blocks at first and then combine them ... and the best way is to use an online environment like Stackblitz. It happened a lot of time to me, don't believe what you see, touch it first..

issue: guys in this stackbliz [<-LINK->] , I want to create tabs dynamic in nature, what should I do so that I do not have to hardcode in my *ngIf condition.  [<-LINK->] 
solution: theDPlayer: That is a really broad question. One might say you could set the inner html to the tab content, but where does the content reside anyways? your array only defines the title and the state. 

issue: ugh add signalr to my project pls@sliceofbytes 
solution: I like living life on the edge, so most is even in core 3. 

issue: which websocket client library do you use? 
solution: well If I use a library I use signalR then I don't have to do any of this. But it accomplishes auth in same way. for bearer at least. sliceofbytes: thx I will try it :). 

issue: hi 
solution: i want to use lazy loading but i've a doubt if that works with root path. EfraimLA: I remember someone complaining it didn't work before, idk if its supported, but then the performance impact of doing such is uneccessary. If you don't use lazy loading, the root path will be defined in the main bundle (which is probably what you want). 

issue: ugh.. email previews... probably full of inline style and global media queries....one of the few things for which you really can't avoid iframe... it's the only way to get a realistic 'preview' 
solution: email styling is always annoying, email need to support very old browser engines, so fancy stuff like scoped style elements or shadowdom host rule aren't supported :/. 

issue: How can we store user cred in our app I don't wanna store it into localstorage Any good way out there?

solution: Remove the brackets in the subscribe and make it exactly like in that example. 

issue: Is there somebody who has experience with Angular server-side rendering? :) If someone is familiar with Angular server-side rendering, please checkout this stackoverflow [<-LINK->] 
solution: VukMNE: I don't think you followed the anguar/univeral docs fully. You can't just host the plain source files with apache. Server-side rendering means there's a server application (usually nodejs/express) that renders the HTML. VukMNE: I think what you are after is usually called 'prerendering' and is an additional step after setting up SSR, since you then use angular/univeral to generate several static HTML files to host.

issue: I have build large SPAs with Angular, but now want to add some angular "widgets" to a regular website (think quote of the day/flight status etc). If I use the normal webpack route, I\'m going to end up with a large bundle which duplicates all the angular resources for each simple little widget. Is there an established pattern for using Angular in this way?

solution: 

issue: Hi, does anyone have an idea about unit test AfterContentInit hook 
solution: 

issue: i had a similar issue yesterdayangular/angular#34306 
solution: neofuture: I guess the solution for your problem is probably by running the drag part outside of the zone. (not 100% sure, but you wanna run the drag part outside of the zone anyway). i reolved it withchangeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPushand thenthis.cdr.markForCheck();in the function that handles the drag. Probably works for your use-case, but I don't think the outcome is the same. If I remember correctly, running outside of the zone will be better in terms of performance. But as said, OnPush might be enough for your use-case..

issue: Hi all, would you bother with Redux for Angular if your app is mostly pages that get their own data from http requests per page? 
solution: There will be some data that is shared everywhere like user profile & permissions but almost all pages have their own http request. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] How your build starts to look when you start lazy loading a few files  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] :D 
solution: you will ALWAYS find the insecuritues in your own solution, and question them, but mostly end users are not that clever to undo your code, so 99% of the time it wont matter. 

issue: allanwest: Tried changing the order of routes, doesn't seem to affect this issue. 
solution: Summerbird76_twitter: Can you try with a pathMatch: 'full' on the LandingComponent route ?. Can you please update the Google Doc with the latest from your route and the TS part of your PasswordResetComponent ?. I have a feeling it might be something else causing the redirection, but no idea what... Maybe authentication error http injector, but should be fine.... 

issue: maxlength should still work on a form control 
solution: sliceofbytes: I cannot figure this out for the life of me...it SHOULD but it doesn't. 

issue: just a qq, is there a way to generate a diagram of the modules in an angular app?

issue: how can i push a complex array/object to the router for query params? e.g. [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: oniice: You could use a parser to handle it, but I'd start to question your goal with it. oniice: I'd say handling complex objects/array is possible, but you start getting a limited limited by the structure (like nesting) and parsing/encoding the params. I recommend using the same library on the back-end and front-end, so the behavior is the same, and look into if there are any strict limitations and build your api query structure around them. 

issue: anybody out there? 
solution: I was just looking for some guidance around ngrx -- not sure if I'm in the right place. there is an ngrx/platform gitter... that would probably be better... I'm there too. 

issue: Hi guys.Just updated my library for Angular 9 / Ivy.But I was really surprised that the size of my demo app had been doubled.From 6MB to 13 MB.I thought Ivy should reduce the size of the apps not make them heavier. 
solution: 

issue: what's rendering at the minute ? what was it ? 
solution: It works if I do this. so that's back to what you do not want. 

issue: I am having a strange issue, and I don't know where to start troubleshooting. I have methods that get called to display data on my pages, like looking up a name from an ID. I noticed that the methods are getting called almost constantly, as if the page is constantly being redrawn. Has anyone seen this before? Any ideas on where to start? My project is huge now. I don't know when the problem began. 
solution: bradtaniguchi: I was think that Angular would only call the method if the input changed. For example, getName(id) would only be called with the value of id changed. But I guess it makes sense that you could have a method that uses some sort of internal value, and Angular wouldn't know if the output changed. I tried a simple example with pipes. It only called it twice. I am not sure if I can change it everywhere because many of my functions are more complex and require multiple objects as input. But I understand now what it is doing, and I will optimize it as much as possible..

issue: Hi, Can someone explain the differences betweenNgZone vs Web Worker, if possible with the example, please?regards.

issue: East coast here too. No celebrating just yet XD 
solution: 

issue: so your api is on port 8080? your http call should be to localhost:8080/path
