issue: can word2vec be used in windows? 
solution: if you can install java and dl4j/blas - you can use any architecture you want. 

issue: Hi again, How to remove any words in vectorfile when before writing? 
solution: however, if you’re sure you want that after model is trained - you can write word vectors yourself. just grab word/vector pairs from w2v and save as you like it. 

issue: Hello again, I am working with word2vec, and I loaded given google news dataset. After initialization, a call tovec.wordsNearest("country", 10)takes around 200 seconds with nd4j-x86 & openblas (no runtime warnings) on ubuntu 14.04. It feels a bit too much. I am working with latest versions on master branch.  Am I missing something? Thank you (btw, system does not do swapping, enough ram is available) 
solution: sebgymn: if you’re building from sources you can see there’s flat array scan, so this method isn’t suited for frequent requests. if you want something fast, you’ll need some advanced techniques applied there. like VPTree for example. 

issue: Set sampling to 0 Negative sampling to 0 too Actually, where you've got this example? 
solution: this one got only 1 iteration, and the seed property, what's that?. 

issue: setup.bat? are you running it from sources? 
solution: yeah... looks like ui section on dl4j site is a bit outdated :(.

issue: raver119: i've been trying to find an example or explanation of how to use paragraphVectors in dl4j and i can't find any i mean found some but lots of depricated methods etx yyep thats what im using but i already have my labels, and .labels() is depricated i used this one but each sentence creates its own label 
solution: since there’s few approaches for labels. you should look at the iterator and see where it pulls it label info from. Some pull it from directory names, some the file name. 

issue: The ".append(File.separator)" at Line 254 in KernelFunctionLoader.java of  nd4j-jcublas-7.5-0.4-rc3.8-sources.jar may be  redundant, it add another "\\" to the path and lead to an error. Thanks, I've found the branch. ok 
solution: 

issue: I think I solved it not sure how... 
solution: 

issue: I was following the quick start guide. Is there a better source to look at? Not really, just habit I suppose. I'll try maven pom.xml. Is this run in each directory? 
solution: that perm gen error is spark related. 

issue: I lost internet just got it back.@agibsonccccan you take a look at a gist really quick and let me know what I'm doing wrong?  I'm getting an error  java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Shapes do not match: x.shape=[36, 3], y.shape=[15, 3]  [<-LINK->]

issue: agibsonccc: did you catch my earlier message? oh right! 
solution: 

issue: willbrahm: I still think you're way over complicating this WAY Why not just track a moving average of the values and normalize relative to that? 
solution: 

issue: Sweet, ok so I can just had the raw CSV to that, no need to do scaling or anything before hand right?  Sorry losing my mind on some of this.  Can't remember what was required on setup ahead of time. Then we do it directly with the datasetiterator.

issue: Re: ND4J - this is reasonably well developed now. We certainly have the basics well covered - everything in DL4J is built on ND4J after all. I'm happy to answer questions about specific features if you like.fyi we are nearing the end of a cuda rewrite currently, should be out soon. OpenCL is planned for the future too. Swapping DL4J to run on either of those is done in dependencies only (i.e., just include a different nd4j backend) re: community - judge for yourself. I mean you can talk directly to the developers here (I'm one). I'll also refer you to@agibsonccc(CTO), who should be on in a few hours. Skymind ( [<-LINK->] ) is the company behind dl4j/nd4j FYI documentation and examples: we still have more work to do on both, but we're getting there.docs: [<-LINK->] examples: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: the problem with adding a new word later is that the everything needs to be "realigned". So all the models that you have trained using those vectors need to adjusted as well. The operation to add a word, is as big as redoing the whole thing at least, this his how I got it with my limited understanding :) 
solution: stephanduq: you’re absolutelu right. the issue is huffman tree index for new word. 

issue: Can someone help me just a moment please? I'm working on adapting our data import system to use nd4j instead of the hand crafted stuff we had.  [<-LINK->] 
solution: This gist takes a matrix (basically a an array of an array of doubles performs normalization on each column and then returns the matrix to the caller so that it can be turned in to a new csv.. 

issue: We're looking at a $10M budget on this if the prototype gets approved but I was only given $50k for the prototype, most of that went to salaries.

solution: 

issue: build failure at deeplearning-core 
solution: subunithya: i don’t know why are you building whole dl4j, but there’s explanation of your copile error right there. 

issue: Turns out model.output(checkData); is leaking for me. Does it make sense the network grows after output? 
solution: there is some stored activations in MultiLayerNetwork, which are needed for backprop calculations. it should be a constant amount of memory usage; i.e., those stored activations will be replaced on next call of output. 

issue: can i use a sentence iterator on LabeledDocument? raver119: i can't find an iterator that accepts labelDocument and parse its sentences i took that and used breakIterator i was thinking if there was anything particular in nd4j :)

issue: I woud love that, a pre-built spark/cuda image 
solution: c0der1337: you might be able to use Lapack for PCA.. you may need to add more heap space. To do that, you’ll need to find and alter your hidden .bash_profile file, which adds environmental variables to bash. To see those variables, enter env in the command line. To add more heap space, enter this command in your console: echo “export MAVEN_OPTS=”-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m”” > ~/.bash_profile.

solution: 

issue: my english is weak 
solution: ShotGunYuan: as well as mine :). i do not understand 'push back' means delayed. just now. 

issue: So I looked into nd4j.. Tell me if I get this right. So ND4J is like abstracting the jcuda library so that users can perform efficient vector operations without worrying about the internal CUDA implementations right.?  And then the ND4J library is callable from Java code.. Now when anyone writes a Spark application in Java he can use the ND4J framework so that his computations are offloaded to a GPU.. However how is the work/ data partitioned among different GPU's in the machine?.  Does ND4J take care of that as well?. 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] Line 2 works fine but line 3 is throwing an exception the only contents of the exception are 1.  The matrix has 10 rows and 12 columns. Any ideas guys? 
solution: 

issue: any chance to see full code and maybe even exception? :) 
solution: It would explain the behavior if the first slice is cutting the length down.  All I'm doing is taking a CSV loading it into a 2 dimensional array, calling mean(0) for each column and then slicing it up to produce data and labels.. 

issue: What is the parameter being passed to .min .max etc ? So if I wanted the minimum along a column n then it's matrix.min(n) ? 
solution: 

issue: So I have a 2 dimensional matrix with 1000 rows 12 columns wide. I want to turn it into a .csv in the most efficient way.  What do I need to do? 
solution: 

issue: Ok so I decided that since hooking up debugger to the server running this is going to be outside my pay grade right now, that I would replace CSV writer with printwriter.  Now something strange... double[] r = data.getRow(x).data().asDouble(); r now contains the complete contents of data, not just row(x) Is that the way its supposed to be? Fixed it by justr using getScalar(x,y) instead but wow that was unintuitive.

issue: im having a very noisy legal dataset and i want to denoise it. I have the output labels and i want to classify a document . Tried the FileLabelAwareIterator but due to the noise the results weren't any good. I read that SDA will decrease that noise by repeating reconstructing the features and learn. 
solution: so denoising autoencoders are a type of unsupervised architecture that attempts to reconstruct the original output from a corrupted input. typical use cases for autoencoders are unsupervised feature learning (put learned features into another network, like a classifier) or dimensionality reduction. 

issue: agibsonccc: re tensorflow, i guess just because it’s getting a lot of attention and i think it has gpu support chrisvnicholson: yes, that’s why i thought it would work, just wasn’t sure about dl4j implementation

I am sort of lost and maybe you can help me?I am interested in building a very simple feedforward neural net, and use backprop for training.  I am using the regression example as the base for my learning, as its pretty much what I intend to do. Only thing I cant understand is: Is the network doing some pretraining? I dont see a backprop stage, is the pretraining, same as the backprop? am I missing something?thanks

solution: 

issue: My solution was to put the bulk of the work in Nashorn and just treat the app as a framework.  Easier to do rapid prototyping in script and move the slower bits into Java/Scala once you do some profiling.  That way you only need to build once.

issue: Hello I am wondering what the status of JCuda 7.5 is? I have a fully working CPU version of dl4j and now I am trying to upgrade it to use my Nvidia GTX 960 card running on Fedora 23. But I keep getting GPUMetrix and CUDA_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS errors from only some of the nd4j tests, and other tests are failing. Though over 70% are passing. I would love to make the failing tests either pass or be ignored if they are not appropriate. 
solution: blair0011: you will see a big blast from us when cuda is ready. 

issue: Oh, I see. I have a dataset with 365 lines,  each line have 48 data of int.I want to do a regression, so the network will use line 0 to predict line 1, and use line 0 and line 1 to predict line 2? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: I see. What if I want to predict the value at time T not only use values in time 0 to time T, but also use some other inputs? 
solution: 

issue: Can i ask some question not quite related to DL4J? 
solution: well, we try to keep this gitter on the topic of dl4j/nd4j, but I guess so :). I have been really tempted to put together a music generation example actually, I just don't quite have the time to do it right now. 

issue: null@1256267binary compat/fields being different can be a challenge the problem with java binary ser/de is the level of compatibility versions have to have with each other it's VERY brittle this is why json/yaml/protobuff is used in practice 
solution: in practice it's not a big deal: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: all: Guys can anyone point me to a copyright or legal data collection which i can use? i can't find anything free 
solution: 

issue: Is it possible to use the DatasetIterator for the SequenceVectors? Because it seems to be the same idea as the SequenceIterator but they have both other implementations. 
solution: But the purpose of using a word2vec representation, is to feed this representation into a Neural Network though?So first you use your data to train a word2vec model and afterwards u use the same data in combination with the word2vec model to train a Neural Network?. 

issue: I am not getting the expected output to the example given over here [<-LINK->] . Is that normal ? 
solution: sreyan32: likely out of date tutorial. agibsonccc: Well the website lists the examples that I have downloaded. That is [<-LINK->]. 

issue: aewhite: please don’t use AdaGrad, set useAdaGrad(false) in your w2v builder for now. On current master that’s already fixed + adagrad gives proper results as well hm. aewhite: show me your source code as gist please 
solution: 

issue: how does negative sampling size of 0 affect the final results? 
solution: like any parameter tuning in w2v - it’s language, domain and corpus dependant. sometimes it’s good, sometimes it’s bad. the same goes for everything there: sampling, negative sampling, dimensions number, window size, stemming/lemmatization used, and even number of iterations/epochs done - everything is empirical. 

issue: ShotGunYuan: the image net examples are still a WIP as far as I know to read CSV files, check out lines 38-41 here: [<-LINK->] the iris DBN example probably isn't tuned. Some examples work great, others not so much 
solution: you sound new to ML. Yes, I am newbie in deeplearning :-). 

issue: Hi@agibsoncccI am bit puzzled testing the same example DBNIrisExample, with the same exact source code gives , the same result over and over in the same machine(1), but executed it in another machine(2), and also gives allways the same results over and over, but different from the machine(1) results by a big amount, the only difference is that machine(1) uses JDK7  and machine(2) uses JDK8 , do you have any clue? It is not the JDK , installed the new one and get the same discrepancy...?? and tested a new machine(3) and gave the same results is in machine(2) , the only diference is that machine(1) is win7 64bits and the other two are win8 ?, the y all seam to use the same blas dlls, any clue? 
solution: 

issue: Got the same Openblass Win8 vs Win7 difference with another Win7 machine, odd because the dlls are the same... 
solution: 

issue: @agibsonccc Just tell me something I have a CSV transform script like the following-:@RELATION UCIIrisDataset@DELIMITER , @ATTRIBUTE sepallength  NUMERIC   !NORMALIZE @ATTRIBUTE sepalwidth   NUMERIC   !NORMALIZE @ATTRIBUTE petallength  NUMERIC   !NORMALIZE @ATTRIBUTE petalwidth   NUMERIC   !NORMALIZE @ATTRIBUTE class        STRING   !LABELIs there any notation on how to deal with Missing values in my dataset ? i have used octave agibsonccc: Iknid of am lost. I need a way to process dataset (txt file) downloaded from UCI into a CSV dataset for dl4j. I am not sure what you mean by nd4j in this case. I was talking about transformation agibsonccc: Basically I want to do what has been done here. [<-LINK->] agibsonccc: Relax. I do believe you. Okay its my fault that I can't explain myself clearly. Give me some time and I will show you what I want to do. Hold on. 
solution: 

issue: I have a dataset that I just downloaded from UCI http://pastebin.com/5k2sz4ytHow do I feed this into Dl4j ? iris.txt is already transformed so that it can be loaded using Record Set. I have not referring to normalize with mean or variance. Infact my question does not relate to maths at all Please have a look 
solution: 

issue: Folks, I see the various scaleout API but don't see anything in the way of documentation. Can someone point me to docs?Also, I have a Spark cluster and would like to train a Word2Vec model in a distributed way. I see various bits of infrastructure in the scaleout packages. And see things that suggest there's support for serializing and aggregating Word2Vec models. Where's the best starting point if I want to understand how to parallelize training a Word2Vec model in Spark? 
solution: 

issue: Nothing that is 1 line of code We are a library to build those systems So you would need to know neural nets This likely isn't a fit unless you know what to do Dl4j can do that but there's a lot of ways to build reccommenders I can try to point you in the right direction if you tell me more 
solution: 

issue: sure, i am thinking about how I bring my weight array "w" into the LossCalculation Class. The formula is sum(w (lables - z)).  Is there an empty variable for this purpose? I guess the next() function delivers the input and lables. Do I have to extent DataSet Class to bring w into the LossCalculation Class? yes, this variables weights the loss for each training example here is the formula: [<-LINK->] ok, I understand, but I am not sure, if I have to extent NeuralNetConfiguration or MultiLayerNetwork for set/adding the weightmatrix? AlexDBlack: thanks, that helps me a lot. I will let you know when it works. I will start tomorrow, gn8 
solution: 

issue: Why my CPU usage is 0.0% for IntelliJ IDEA in the VisualVM? 
solution: Yeah, that's really what I want. I self-define a pooling operation! Thanks very much!. 

issue: agibsonccc: ok, I can with net.setParam(weights) retrieve them in the BaseOutputlayer to compute the gradients (line 152) however I dont know how I can extent the "Builder" of LossCalculation to feed the weight matrix into the score function via BaseOutputlayer (Line 108). I added a INDArray weighted, but LossCalculation.builder().weighted(getParam("weighted")) appear an error. Sorry, I think the problem are my bad java skills :-( 
solution: 

issue: i can’t understand what do you want. you want to compare two abstract vectors? dpasch01: sent me private message, and explain what you want, and i’ll be glad to help you 
solution: 

issue: I am looking for a deep reinforcement learning java library. I have images as input which I want to convolute first. BURLAP will not do this? 
solution: I found two implementations, one theano based, the other is chainer based. I will use one of these. and not in one net, i assume?. I mean we have the cnns etc. 

issue: I change the log level in dropwizard-render.yml but the yml is actually regenerated by the program every time Ok, I found it Is it right that I set activation in the NeuralNetConfiguration.Builder, and not specify any in the specific layers? Do those layers inherit the setting of the builder? 
solution: yeah. If you set like .activation("tanh") before the .list(...), any layers you specify will have tanh activation function - unless otherwise specified. 

issue: Dear, I want use dl4j for unsupervised learning, and how can I get the middle layer's output? But I can't find the methods in SparkDl4jMultiLayer, should I learn by SparkDl4jMultiLayer and then load network by MultiLayerNetwork to feedForward? 
solution: Does ScoreIterationListener can  work with SparkDl4jMultiLayer?. 

issue: After fitDataSet, the result of getScore is 0.0, any tips for this situation? 
solution: 

issue: Do you think dense layers can work well for a 5-layer network, i.e., will the vanishing gradient effect be an issue here? 
solution: 

issue: nope 3.8 for both nd4j and dl4j anc 0.0.0.14 for canova 
solution: 

issue: I am just using google model, it get a exception while loading the 3.39 GB file. [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I am a windows user and I need a help for running deeplearning4j on intelliJ I got the error that "java package org.canova.api.util does not exist" 
solution: pari125: you need to use maven. 

issue: raver119: Is it detailed enough? [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: have an iteration listener that tracks the score would be my advice 
solution: 

issue: dropconnect and dropout are two separate mechanisms dropout drops (sets to zero) activations, dropconnect drops connections/weights so for dropout, use .dropout(x) and .regularization(true) dropout is more widely used, and yes it's what they are referring to there dropconnect: [<-LINK->] 
solution: Because the case in neuralnetwork.com is 50%, so I don't know dropout is the probability that neuron gets remained or gets abandoned. 

issue: null@1256267please file an issue, since i'm on the UI issues right now, so i'll look into it PatrykTies: cuda isn’t supported yet, and nd4j-jblas backend was deprecated some time ago nd4j-cublas backend is under major overhaul right now and use nd4j-x86 backend till that time sorry, but 1 sentence-long issue isn’t explanatory enough. for me at least :( 
solution: Of course. 

issue: Hi all, I have constant problems with Benchmark tests for jblas (jcublas dont work at all as CUDA7 is not supported yet?)from ND4J site. Got log files if needed, any one had similar problems running those benchmarks? OS win7 x64 , jre8, intellij & eclipse, blas optimized for my cpu, cuda7. works. ok thanks, what shall i do now? wait untill cublas is released? 
solution: 

issue: Could you help me resolve my worries pls? ''The default backend for CPUs is x86, which relies heavily on Netlib-blas'' It seems my native blas dont work well, I did compiled OpenBLAS  for my cpu succesfully, eclipse ide stopped showing warnings that blas is missing but performance still same, intellij still complaints that blas is missing. I have all dlls , do i have to copy them along with project ? or classpath, or path? 
solution: but ./ usually checked too. 

issue: ok, thanks, I am just starting learning process, started with optimized backend and benchmarks, i gues im done 
solution: 

issue: hey, does anyobody managed to use in memory vocabCache and lookuptable? I can't manage it to work :/ agibsonccc: i'm playing with word2vec and putting in a lot of poorly structured address data to be able to label parts of these addresses, first results are looking promising raver119: @agibsoncccI wrote a wrapper app around d4j so i can test and monitor various settings in batch mode and i tried to save the full model to a file, but that only is supported with in memory data structures 
solution: "@raver119@agibsoncccI wrote a wrapper app around d4j so i can test and monitor various settings in batch mode and i tried to save the full model to a file, but that only is supported with in memory data structures". 

issue: jannemann: what's up with lookuptable/vocabcache? jannemann: i hadn't saw issues with them for quite a long time. they are used everywhere within dl4j-nlp oh there was one call within wordvectorserializer that was using exceptionally InMemoryLookupCache jannemann: please show me the gist of your code, and i'll help you to get around it on current master that restriction is removed, and accidently i have WordVectorSerializer with 3.9 functionality that is compatibly with 3.8 codebase :) so show me gist with your code, and i'll be glad to help you with your issue hm. or you could just use WordVectorSerializer.writeWordVectors() instead jannemann: i don't see model saving here 
solution: 

issue: jsteggink: I wrote that page. Glad it was helpful.your minibatch size is set via the DataSetIterator - i.e., the one of the constructor arguments in SequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator, if you are using thatnumber of epochs: easiest is often to just call MultiLayerNetwork.fit(DataSetIterator) as many times as you have epochs so when you say you have 165,000 examples - is this 165k separate sequences? or 165k time steps? ok, sure. so yeah, if your data is in separate files in CSV format, you can load it using the SequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator as per the details on that page then train with a minibatch size on the order of 50-200 examples (time series) that's a good starting point, at least 
solution: 

issue: right, you've missed my first message then just use WordVectorSerializer.writeWordVectors() instead 
solution: 

issue: How to use Canova? On the website, it says "Download our latest release at: [Coming Soon]" I got problem building ND4J  [<-LINK->] AlexDBlack: I have installed both VisualStudio 2010 and 2012 on my win7, and tried to repair 2012, but cl.exe is not in the system path Just here, [<-LINK->] Installation note chrisvnicholson: can you solve my ND4J build problem? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: I just doing a small project to my local customer using python ecosystem,but they just hope that can use JVM ecosystem, so I just want to find other choice. 
solution: 

issue: Hi all, I'm getting into DL4J right now. I was studying TensorFlow+MINST, but had some difficulties, so wandering around hit DL4J and feel that can be more clear my background is Java+Eclipse and with DL4J I was able to setup a running example:  StackedAutoEncoderMnistExample ( by agibsonccc) The problem that I am trying to solve is: given a 50x25 grayscale image, classify it So thought this example is the right one, I'm I right? 
solution: 

issue: potentially dumb question: how can I be sure that the GPU is actually being used? or can i trust that nd4j-jcublas won't just fall back on CPU if there's some kind of problem both useful information thanks 
solution: 

issue: i had to check w2v reader in virtual environment, virtualbox on linux host - actually there was 0 difference for me between host and guest vox box* i’m not on desktop right now, but 3 minutes for model loader is way worse that i see on my usual workstation sounds more like IOps bounded, or cpu or both :) 
solution: 

issue: Watching vmstat. cpu and io staying busy. 
solution: 

issue: Could somebody, please, explain to me why this code: [<-LINK->] contains for loop? agibsonccc: : It always useslocations[0]and it's repeat as many times as we have dimensions. Maybe I don't get  something but it looks like very suspicious to me. 
solution: For now feel free to use your own. 

issue: Thank you. Actually, it turns out that I cant't useMLLibUtil.fromBinaryout of the box anyway, because it expectsJavaPairRDD<String, PortableDataStream>and it's quite cumbersome to work with them in Scala, so I've replaced it with my own code and I also have replaced record reader with utility object method that contains streamlined code fromBaseRecordReader.initializeandBaseRecordReader.next. It's a local hack just for me right now, I'm not sure that it would generalize well. If I would be able to get from it something that worth to be put in the library, I'll try to post it. The issue aboutBaseImageRecorReaderis here. 
solution: 

issue: still haven't revved to 0.4-rc3.9 yet? The Zipfian thing? 
solution: Part of it has been architecture though. 

issue: bennythedataguy: no kidding; but how do we map and track those 10k engineers so that they can all start learning from each others mistakes?I've started compiling testing libraries & research documentation... 
solution: 

issue: Do I need to specify loss function in the hidden layers for classification? Is XAVIER weight initialization ok for classification? @ me if anyone reply me, thank you 
solution: 

issue: any reason why the LSTM shakespeare example (unchanged) would be giving me NaNs? setting Nd4j.ENFORCE_NUMERICAL_STABILITY=true fixes the problem but really does slow things down agibsonccc: os x indeed. good to know i'm at least not doing anything wrong 
solution: 

issue: I'm looking for tools which convert CSV etc to multiple Graph DB's & am wondering about the abilities for deeplearning4j to work with them. 
solution: 

issue: If I pretrain model, when can I stop? Where can I see the reconstruction error Ok, it doesn't improve the score anymore 20:10:46.352 [main] INFO  o.d.nn.multilayer.MultiLayerNetwork - Finetune phase20:10:47.106 [main] DEBUG o.d.o.solvers.BackTrackLineSearch - slope = -4.530583282758016E-620:10:47.113 [main] DEBUG o.d.o.solvers.BackTrackLineSearch - Model score after step = 285.51210937520:10:47.113 [main] DEBUG o.d.o.solvers.BackTrackLineSearch - Sufficient decrease (Wolfe cond.), exiting backtrack on iter 0: score=285.512109375, scoreAtStart=286.7333007812520:10:47.123 [main] DEBUG o.d.o.solvers.ConjugateGradient - Polak-Ribiere gamma <= 0.0; using gamma=0.0 -> SGD line search. dgg=-2.787579944651952E-7, gg=4.530583282758016E-620:10:47.124 [main] INFO  o.d.o.l.ScoreIterationListener - Score at iteration 0 is 285.512109375 Is it wrong? 
solution: not necessarily. that slope value has a specific meaning in the context of termination conditions for line search algorithms (so-called Wolfe conditions). 

issue: debug -> info -> warn -> error so, when you set log level to warn, you’ll see only warn and error messages, and won’t see anything below warn in your resources folder 
solution: 

issue: Okay, I just finish to code the simulator of my data in time, and I would like to connect it to a network, this is where I'm in my project. 
solution: that will get you pretty far. 

issue: no, the batchSize doesn't change things. But sure enough I am doing some huge error since I get a call FeatureUtil.toOutcomeVector(curr=28, numPossibleLabels=3), but don't understand why 
solution: well, inspect the labels column. see what data is actually there. 

issue: Hey.. I am trying to DeepLearning4j example code for stacked auto-encoder(StackedAutoEncoderMnistExample).But I am getting timeout error while trying to fetch the MNIST data Can anyone please help I don't think it s a network problem I m able to access everything else It\'s failing on trying to fetch this " [<-LINK->] " 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: then for the deepautoencoder to work, is there a way to fix the second half layers weights manually in each fit()? 
solution: 

issue: I'm new to Spark. Any idea how to get a OutputStream for HDFS? I only found solutions needing RDDs and then get problems because the single Word2Vec is too big for Spark's frame size and I can't increase it as much as I would need it to 
solution: Also the Word2Vec constructor taking an INDArray in the spark namespace doesn't do anything (the data is never used as far as I can see). 

issue: Thanks@agibsoncccwill try to do it starting from [<-LINK->] or [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: I got the following error when tried to train my data set. What could be the cause? Shapes do not match: x.shape=[10, 17], y.shape=[10, 549] The detail is here.  [<-LINK->] I see..., this is my first time to try my own data. [10, 549] 
solution: 

issue: usually a configuration error I can't see what the issue is there on first glance, but quite often this stuff comes down to a difference between the configured and actual input/output sizes can you check the dimensionality of the output data being generated? one sec, I'll give you something to run System.out.println(Arrays.toString(iter.next().getLabels().shape())); can you do that before your while loop? 
solution: 

issue: When I use RecordReaderDataSetIterator with ImageRecordReader as written in the Data Pipeline tutorial, data sets are normalized by default? I mean each pixel values ranging from 0-255. It should be normalized to 0-1.0, right? 
solution: 

issue: Hi! Recently, I'd like to use the LSTM model in dl4j. I have some experience of ND4J and I have read the example of CharGenerator and RNN in dl4j document! Is it possible to not use fit() in training but use feedforward and backward in two different stages? Because the output of LSTM will be used in some custom caculation and return the error for the LSTM nets! Thank you. 
solution: 

issue: Yeah, I do something like the reinforcement learning using LSTM, I need custom loss because I need the output scores of many instance to compute the neural net error for backpropagation I read the code of BaseLayer.java for fit() implementation, but it turn to solver and optimizer My net error could not be computed within one examples, it need some global information. 
solution: 

issue: I use .getWordVector to get vector of a word not in the pretrained word2vec, but still get some values. I expected to get zeros. 
solution: you get unk vector. just check vocab if it has this word or not. 

issue: zzyxzz: are you actually using the most recent 3.8 versions for both dl4j and nd4j? 
solution: 

issue: HI, I'm getting a 'noClassDefFoundError' when trying to use nd4j in android. Is anyone using android and is there any documentation out there? like I have a class that uses dl4j and when I try to instantiate it I get that error and like I use nd4j-java in my gradle file and like org.deeplearning4j-core... oh 
solution: You have to use nd4j-x86 with java turned off. 

issue: radiodee1: there's currently an open issue for running nd4j on android 'noClassDefFoundError'  tells me nothing though You're talking to the guy who wrote it if that's enough docs for you that still tells me nothing zero zilch I need a full stack trace This is the current android sample being worked on: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: The Layer transpose function is completely broken. I need help. Calling it generates the following error. [<-LINK->] anyone here ?? hello ??? 
solution: 

issue: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Column of left array 10 != rows of right 40 or rows of left array 563 != columns of right 30at org.nd4j.linalg.util.LinAlgExceptions.assertMultiplies(LinAlgExceptions.java:76) Can someone help me with this error My neural net configuration is as follows -: MultiLayerConfiguration decodeConf = new NeuralNetConfiguration.Builder().seed(seed).iterations(iterations).learningRate(1e-6).optimizationAlgo(OptimizationAlgorithm.LINE_GRADIENT_DESCENT).list(3).layer(0, new RBM.Builder().nIn(10).nOut(20).lossFunction(LossFunction.RMSE_XENT).build()).layer(1, new RBM.Builder().nIn(20).nOut(40).lossFunction(LossFunction.RMSE_XENT).build()).layer(2, new OutputLayer.Builder().nIn(40).nOut(30).lossFunction(LossFunction.RMSE_XENT).build()).pretrain(true).backprop(true).build(); 
solution: 

issue: looks like you are doing the weight transposing wrongcheck the shape of the weights matrix before and after your setTransposeWeightsInTarget methodbefore: weights for decode layer 0 is shape [10,20]after: shape [40,30] I think you might want: setTransposeWeightsInTarget(encodeLayers[i], decodeLayers[decodeLayers.length-i-1]); perhaps? errors are 3d same shape as activations out activations out of the LSTM layer I mean list is for all layers yes  [<-ISSUE->] wait, your network architecture is input -> LSTM -> dense? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] Hi@AlexDBlack, I meet an error when using LSTM without outputLayer to do back-propagation. It's okay for forward. But when backprop, it begins to throw shape exception. Here is the code and error. I think maybe I should not give the LSTM  a 3-dimension error through time? it only accepts error for back-propagation of one given time? But the forward function return a list? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: Hey is there a documentation page that lists on how to build from src ? AlexDBlack: Thanks. Downloading the sources now. 
solution: 

issue: joel-odlund: labels are not required. labels are used to indentify entities you’re passing inside its the same as words for w2v using words there doesn’t make w2v supervised 
solution: so say i have 50 mil sentences.  that would be a significant amount of parameters.  do they all need to fit in memory ?. 

issue: Just in case I misunderstand something simple: I should use dj4j with Spark like any other Spark application, package it to the fat jar and the submit it to Spark viaspark-submit, right? agibsonccc: Great news! (about GPUs, I mean) Reducing the amount of GPU/host memory transfers is a tricky thing, yeah Great, can't wait to try it ;) Right now the speed of computations is a major bottleneck for the project that I work on. 
solution: 

issue: I ran the CSVexample, which only loaded 10 lines from iris.txt loaded ... {0=10.0 loaded ... {0=10.0}  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: Oo mind filing a dl4j issue? We'll add that to the docs zzyxzz: yes There's not much to add here CNNs aren't meant for  low dimensionality data like that 
solution: 

issue: hi, potentially a stupid question.  I try get nd4j-JCublas-7.0 in an osgi environment running so I have to fight with dependencies. however, my  project can't find any backend. I'm wondering which .jar I'm missing which contains the backend for nd4j-jcublas-7.0? thank you! I'm on rc3.8 raver119: any timeline on this? 
solution: FWIW, dl4j is targeted at people who use spark with data parallelism for training. 

issue: howdy. I'm trying an android project. was here yesterday I got the 3.9 snapshot from github and it helped, but I've still got problems I used System.setProperty() as recommended but I get this crash that the program cant find BLAS. I'll include a gist here : [<-LINK->] the offending line 'INDArray a =  model.output(/input here/)'model is a multilayer convoutional neural network 
solution: 

issue: does the philosophical focus on parallelism extend to nd4j? like if i literally just want numpy on my laptop but on the JVM, is it a reasonable thing to build around? or is the plan that as it progresses it will become something like spark where it will work on a single machine but it's not designed for that use case at all 
solution: 

issue: I had try to trainning the LSTM network, but the score is getting bigger after each epoch What can I do for this problem? 
solution: that's usually a tuning issue. often learning rate too large. 

issue: Great work guys, I read the details of your work on your site and got me even more interested in ML 
solution: Well done. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] I get an error: "java.lang.IllegalStateException: Column of left array 3240 != rows of right 1620 or rows of left array 10 != columns of right 500". That seems to happen at feed forward from layer 7(subsampling) to layer 8(dense). The gist is here. Am I configuring the network incorrectly? 
solution: sato-cloudian: hm, so looks like the dense layer is definitely expecting 1620 in, but is getting 3240 in... not sure why, but might be a bug in ConvolutionLayerSetup. 

issue: I've tried H2O, it doesn't support conv layer and many others So I think DL4J will be the best 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: Can you please check that if this is okay ? Please not that i have replaced the weights an biases in the reverse order. IS IT OKAY ? Do I have to do the same for the hidden BIAS ?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: check the shapes of the bias and visible bias vs. the number of inputs/outputs and you'll see that's necessary. 

issue: I asked this question yesterday already, and I know you guys can't/don't want to make any promises: but what is the expected release date of rc3.9 or higher? or lets say some SNAPSHOT of it? rather 1,2 weeks or 6-8?... just need to plan my next weeks a bit ... 
solution: 

issue: Hello, everyone, I’ve successfully ran the Paragraph Vector classifier example and modified it a bit to use my dataset. Now I’d like to serialise it to a file to avoid the training step (2hs on my macbook) but it is not clear to me how. SerializationUtils fail because of a NotSerializableException  (AbstractSequenceIterator is not). I’ll be grateful with anyone that can point me in the right direction. 
solution: fedesilva: well the only way till 3.9 hits, is to use WordVectorSerializer from 3.9. if you want, i can give you modified version that’s compatible with 3.8 codebase. i wrote that paravec, and i’m the persone who forgot about serialization for it :). 

issue: Cannot serialize ParagraphVectors. I have tried using WordVectorSerializer. Serializing the full model does not complain, but loading the serialized model does not work. 
solution: 

issue: hello. I was asked to supply a dex for an android project. Instead maybe I can supply a link to my project on github. It's actually pretty small. It relies heavily on the LenetMnistExample from the cnn examples repository. It's not finished. No licenses yet, stuff like that. [<-LINK->] this is my stack trace, btw: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: sanity: not sure why you would do that? It would depend on your batch size I would try to batch each of those Make that more efficient That's unnecessarily slow 
solution: 

issue: Hi! How can I monitor a model training on Spark? As far as I can undersand, usual iteration listeners likeParamAndGradientIterationListenerorScoreIterationListenerwouldn't work in that case. 
solution: agibsonccc: I think that the tricky part is to coordinate distributed listeners and also somehow to monitor the averaging itself, but I am a layman there, so I easily could be wrong.. 

issue: Another stupid question about Spark: I am logging each image when it is read fromPortableDataStreamand each image have been read several times (3, actually). Is this behavior expected? 
solution: 

issue: I'd advise doing some pre data pipeline work Separate it from the training this way it's only read once spark and hadoop are inefficient with large files anyways I'd combine that and try to get each of those in to a csv format or something zzyxzz: I'd have to explore that a bit more I'm honestly not sure File an issue and I can look at it link to the paper too whatever it is we likely can't do it atm for different window sizes you'd likely have to setup the data pipeline yourself 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: Just to be clear: you are suggesting to read images, store the pixel values as one giant CSV and later read this CSV to toRDD[LabeledPoint]orRDD[DataSet], right? 
solution: it’s called “not a very efficient use of time” :)  I’ve heard deep learning was fiddly, but didn’t realize it wasthisfiddly. 

issue: hey guys. I was wondering if there was a way to vstack multiple INDArrays that are in a list. The javadoc mentions that vstack only works  for two INDArrays at a time. awesome! the commenting threw me off... would I be able to pass a ListIterator that contains all the INDArrays that I need to stack? 
solution: you should be able to pass array of INDArray. 

issue: does anyone here is using netBeans IDE? 
solution: AppleSoice: everything with maven support should work for you. 

issue: null@1256267a lot of what you need is in the javadocs: [<-LINK->] , [<-LINK->] , [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: hi guys, is it possible to run the word2vec example just by export it as a jar and running it like that: hadoop jar word2vec.jar? 
solution: 

issue: hi I'm trying to build a simple mlp to approximate the sin() function ( [<-LINK->] ). With the same network config, I was able to easily achieve this using torch but could not get something satisfactory using dl4j. Am I doing anything wrong? agibsonccc: the code is at [<-LINK->] thanks 
solution: 

issue: andirey: please read up on DL4J here: [<-LINK->] raver119: knows that inside and out. He'll get back to you 
solution: 

issue: an LR of 1e-6 is way too slow for this: the mlp didn't converges to something nice after 5000 iterations * 20 epochs o.d.o.l.ScoreIterationListener - Score at iteration 0 is 424.5752868652344o.d.o.l.ScoreIterationListener - Score at iteration 50 is Infinity using sgd with LR 1e-2 
solution: 

issue: mabualsh: we don't have any examples like that, unfortunatelyalso note that some of those architectures (i.e., multiple inputs/outputs, etc) will require the our new computation graph architecture, which allows networks built with an arbtitrary directed acyclic graph structurethat functionality will be in the next release (we haven't done a release on maven central since that was completed) but in principle, there's no reason why you can't build all of those architectures with dl4j 
solution: 

issue: ivanhoeabrahams: can you open an issue on the examples repo regarding this? I'll take a look tomorrow 
solution: 

issue: How can i do this by myself? Can i do something like numpy to split the dataset  into 10 parts and iterate it? 
solution: 

issue: HI@AlexDBlack, I have followed your suggestion and split DataSet into a train fold and test fold [<-CODE->] when fit the model, shall I just pass the DataSet train_fold to model.fit()? Or I should call .getFeatureMatrix()? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, does anyone has code for training sequence labeling(POS tagging or any IOB problem) with GravesLSTM? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: but setting the model with  .pretrain(true) and then just call the .fit(data)  method is not the same as calling model.pretrain(data); and then  model.fit(data)  ? 
solution: 

issue: Any information on it's objective? 
solution: It's obviously a optimization engine, but it seems closely related to another project. 

issue: Are the optimizations going to be tightly tied to the model? or will you be able to append the model as the thing to be optimized? Not that Sci-kits grid search is a great example of an optimizer, but they for example have a pretty open ended option there. 
solution: 

issue: seriously, uber jar == every other dep. used for app is packed into one jar. so there's everything dl4j uses internally. not even close to 1gb so, do the same, and look what takes your space 
solution: 

issue: any particular reason you are downloading source? maven central sets all that up for you in your ide the source files get published Did you install nd4j, and canova? It sounded like you skipped reading the site completely

issue: well you could watch Belgian TV  That used to put me to sleep at 2:30 when I lived there. 
solution: haha. 

issue: so, how demanding is word2vec from a computational perspective, in relation to simpler methods? is it by orders of magnitude tougher, or? can't really find any good comparison 
solution: spent half a year using traditional methods, but i want to get on par with state of the art this time around. 

issue: Hello. Can someone help me with regression? I have downloaded dlj4-examples. It contains RegressionExample.java. What are the scores that it gives me on every iteration? I am interested in rmse for my dataset. 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: Is the rmse that this code outputs for the learning set provided to the neural network?  [<-CODE->] 
solution: I want rmse for the testing set, but I think the code in the example outputs the rmse for the training set. yeah that's from calling fit, the output is from network.score(). 

issue: Hi, is the class Word2VecRawTextExample supposed to give meaningful results with its raw_sentences.txt? When I render the results with t-sne (TSNEStandardExample), it looks rather random. raver119: I'm actually using the examples directly, only changing the path so TSNEStandardExample takes the output of Word2VecRawTextExample and then render with gnuplot. but I can open issue with screenshot it that helps. 
solution: 

issue: to ask again if my question was missed - is there any way to avoid the nd4j-x86 -> netlib -> jniloader dependency, since jniloader is LGPL? agibsonccc: : is that support in 0.4-rc3.8? 
solution: 

issue: so what are the options currently for avoiding netlib? I see that there are only rc3.6 snapshots for the nd4j-jblas backend in search.maven.org so there currently isn't any workable alternative? no I'm not, sorry

solution: 

issue: I saved and reloaded a model, but the UI doesn't come up on the restart/reload. Everything else seems to work fine. Am I missing anything really obvious? 
solution: I did that - after loading config, but neither a histogram listener nor the ScorfeIterationListener seems to work. 

issue: I am new to git/github and am learning as i go. It seems you cannot make a pull request out of the clonned project in your local disk.  Thought a pull request adds code into a temporary branch etc (as gist does). I had to fork the master branch and then make the change in the fork. Any shortcut for doing this? 
solution: i am working on clustering/classification of documents. Some documents are lengthy. The collections will not be bigger than 50,000 docs though. Just want to see if using paragraph vectors improve effectiveness/correctness of clustering. 

issue: Hello, For some reason when training word2vec it takes too much time. For 100 sentences around 6seconds. For my 100K documents it never completes. Is this normal ? 
solution: Ops I dont know what gist is! :(. 

issue: not even DM? hard to help ;/ 
solution: change letters to anything you want. 

issue: Why are you trying to download 0.4-rco? We said earlier that nd4j and dl4j need to be the same version 
solution: if our docs state that anywhere we've done something horribly wrong. 

issue: FWIW: I figured out the issue with setting iteration listeners after loading a model. I need to call savedNetwork.setListeners( ... ) before setting the updater.

issue:  [<-LINK->] If whatever is listed here doesn't work idk what to tell you 
solution: 

issue: devlop16: if there' s anything missing in our docs would you mind filing an issue? 
solution: elifzorer: you need another tokenizer then. at examples there's simple white-space tokenizer used.

issue: so im new to maven, I just pulled down dl4j and ran the setup.sh it successfulyl completed 
solution: Where did you read that you had to pull from source?. 

issue: so how do i incorporate dl4j in an already existing project thanks for helping by the way, sry im a newb 
solution: so this is a little new to me. 

issue: so I need to create a maven project in eclipse, build dl4j there, then reference that project from my existing project? something like that? 
solution: You don't need to know much about maven to use what I gave you. 

issue: agibsonccc: awesome thanks for the info, might be able to do a benchmark for u in the next few weeks. We will most likely be using dl4j becuase the the spark integration. 
solution: cool!. 

issue: Hello all. Im trying to install the word2vec implementation It takes a long download time hehe 
solution: You should never do that. It is downloading the dependencies.. 

issue: Are you using the latest version? 0.4-rc3.8? If you are, try this: [<-LINK->] add this to your pom as you see in the above example and change your version to be: 0.4-rc3.9-SNAPSHOT for nd4j/dl4j and canova 0.0.0.15-SNAPSHOT yes: resolvers += "Sonatype snapshots" at " [<-LINK->] " the exact versions I described above that's for sbt 
solution: With the modified build.sbt, I get into this : [<-CODE->] Do I have to also update the examples, or use another git branch?To solve it, I have just changed the extension of the problematic file to take it out of the compilation. Code is now running.. 

issue: sebastiennoir: set negative to 0 on w2v builder,OR use snapshot both will work 
solution: yeah then use snapshot. 

issue: hi, are there code examples for using your vectorizers? 
solution: file a doc issue with a statement of your problem and we can try to help, we usually discourage bag of words (partially because we don't have sparse yet ;)) but also because of the lack of precision of the values. 

issue: Hello! First, great to see a Java ML framework. I'm trying to train on my laptop, just to get a feel for how it all works. Can I  call the 'fit' method in parallel? like this trainDataset.batchBy(10).stream().parallel().forEach(minibatch -> model.fit(minibatch)); 
solution: jamielister: that being said if you already know what you're getting yourself into yes. 

issue: Hi all, does anyone know if there is an implementation of RNNLM using deeplearning4j? I am looking for an example of Tomas Mikolov's RNNLM, but can not find, just wondering if there is one implemented that I can play with. 
solution: he has that stuff listed on his site. 

issue: Hi, I'm trying to use deeplearning4j on spark with scala, the examples link is broken [<-LINK->] . I found examples using SparkDl4jMultiLayer that fits on spark's RDD. I also found NeuralNetworkClassificationParams that trains on DataFrame but wasn't able to use it so far 
solution: 

issue: @AlexDBlacknet.score(new DataSet(example,example));Okay can you explain this line. Does scoring indicate that I take the feature matrix and run it through the model and then score it with the actual labels ? 
solution: 

issue: alexde989: argmax(a,0) is argmax along dimension 0 (rows) -> along dimension 0 = do argmax for each columnhence it returns an array of values, one result for each column make sure you are up to date with both nd4j and dl4j otherwise could be an issue with refactoring work that's going on currently 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: maven central repo only has nd4j-x86-04-rc8. Is there rc9 or rc9-SNAPSHOT? if So where is is it? Ahh! ok. I know what it is now.  My fork is only deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j 
solution: 

issue: my fault, still using rc-3.8. But i dont find the 3.9-snapshot on maven central? Do i need to build it by myself? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: i mean the following question: you’ve got this error using snapshot? not a 3.8 version, right? 
solution: 

issue: what is the recommended nd4j-backend for spark on x86? is it ndj4-x86? Not sure because i used ndj4-jblas, where only 3.6 is available 
solution: right now there’s only nd4j-x86 to be used. right. jblas is slow anyway. 

issue: raver119: problem found. Seems one of the book was gene sequences and there was a line of 204M characters. so it was working and not frozen raver119: well, it was working. just taking forever for the 204M character line. Sure that is an issue? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: OK, how i build my data set with using bigram ? Is there a way for this ? 
solution: 

issue: @AlexDBlack You said argmax(0) is for every column so why is it returning 1 for each column ? http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/reference/generated/numpy.argmax.htmlshould'nt it return the max value in each column ? raver119: Why is axis 0 considered to be the max index for the columns ? should'nt axis 0 be for rows ? 
solution: 

issue: rc3.9-SNAPSHOT is suitable for cuda testing or not yet? 
solution: devlop16: not. 

issue: Hi! I'm a beginner to deeplearning4J. I want to start a new project in Scala with DL4J, but I am not sure what to download and where to install it. Could someone help me with the procedure to start a new project? 
solution: raver119: I've tried to follow the walkthrough given in [<-LINK->] , but I am not sure on how to apply the instructions to get it to work for Scala. 

issue: JohnTheDang: there are scala examples on the site, but it's basically identical to the java API JohnTheDang: are you referring to [<-LINK->] 
solution: and there's like zero activity in the issues department. 

issue: TomAshley303: Hi, you seem to be the last person who brought up clojure. I'm looking into different neural network frameworks and I'd love to be able to use Clojure. Is there a Clojure project that wraps deeplearning4j? I can't seem to find it. Generally, it seems like deeplearning4j scales well, but I'm actually working on an academic cluster and looking to run deep learning experiments. Is this an appropriate framework to use?

solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: Did'nt get your direct message. How do you check it ? i thought Github did not have a direct messaging feature Did you check my screen shots ? 
solution: 

issue: I get different vector values for two ParagraphVectors corresponding to paragraphs with identical content except for their lables. Is this correct? This leads to incorrect clustering. Is it because the paragraph lables say  "DOC1", "DOC2" are also inserted as words during learning. So two documents with the same paragraph content will not be the same. I use my own lables. I will raise an issue with some code to reproduce this. 
solution: 

issue: How can I tackle this when the corpus is small? 
solution: increase learning rate, increas epochs and pray.. i could add something like option to predefine distribution of initial weights matrix, but that has no sense in real world use imho.

solution: 

issue: Hi, I am trying to run word2vec over a subset of commoncrawl, and it seems that the deeplearning4j spark implementation was a good option for that. With the non-spark implementation everything goes fine (but I can't use many machines), in the spark implementation, version -rc-8 spits to stdout deep in a loop and slows down things like crazy. The -rc-9-SNAPSHOT runs fine, but gives me non-sense vectors, so it seems that there is some regression (together with many improvements). Is this a good forum to try to nail this issue? 
solution: 

issue: Is a newer version of [<-LINK->] available? It does not works Compile error - and it seems it use old builder style 
solution: You had a working image pipeline already.

issue: I believe your args should be like --master ... --class "class of your script entry point here" "jar file path here"usually need to specify class of the script to run, like "my.package.MyEntryPoint" or whatever I believe@agibsoncccmay have removed it. The canova examples were quite out of date anyway sadly, documentation on thas side of things is sparse at the momentjust limited time on our part, with everything else we have going onyour best option at this point might be to ask here if you have a specific use case in mind, we might be able to point you in the right direction though for dealing with RDDs, you might find some of these unit tests useful: [<-LINK->] not all of that functionality is in 0.4-rc3.8 though there's an issue with 3.8 rc3.8 that is... there's a simple workaround. one sec

issue: Mr Gibson, I am interested in predicting with a trained dl4j model in a Tegra K1 or X1 running ubuntu.  Have you ya'll made it work with cuda yet? for the case of evaluation at least. nice.  is the plan to use cudnn? 
solution: as with all of our gpu stuff it will be robust to multithreading and the like as well. 

issue: so should i join my unlabeled data with my labeled data? 
solution: set pretrain to true, backprop to false. and build a pretrain model you continuously feed unlabeled examples. then you can train 1 or more classifiers based on the output of the other neural net. pretrain/finetune is just a logistic regression that learns the features of a multi layer network. 

issue: here's my issue, which is driving my questions.  I'm getting signal data.  I can get a lot of unlabeled data, but only a small set of labeled data, so I'm looking at semi-supervised to improve the classification accuracy or regression, either would work 
solution: 

issue: Beginner ND4j question: I would like to get a view or copy of a NDArray with specific axes reversed.  In matlab, this seems to be supported by the flip, fliplr, flipup functions.   I've succeeded in doing some really basic things with array.get(DArrayIndex.interval(a1,a2),...)  but can't  reverse the interval (eg. (a2,a1)).  Is this concept supported? I opened an issue.  Thanks. 
solution: 

issue: guys, would you happen to know if there is a feature allowing evolution of the model? For example, imagine you have a social network composed mostly of young people and you train a nn to recognise gender, then the demographics of the social network changes and you want to retrain your network but as a starting point you want to use the previous model. Is it possible with deeplearning4j?

issue: i have now made a new project, in which I've added the mentioned dependency together with a property declartion for the version number and then downloaded nd4s via maven, but it still gives me the same error message for the same code How do you mean run nd4s? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, somebody already/still there? I have no idea how to get DL4J working with a lot of "factorial" data as it is called in R, so like Weekdays or Colors 
solution: 

issue: Can someone tell me on how to feed in a CIFAR example to a neural network ? How to a input it ? As rgb values separately or as 32x32 pixel images. if it is the later how do I normalize them ? since pixel values are a combination of rgb each of a value between [0 to 255] ie how should my Input vector look like ? 
solution: if your images are jpgs or similar files, then use the ImageRecordReader + RecordReaderDataSetIterator. 

issue: AlexDBlack: Exactly. So how do you deal with multichannel files ? I can extract the images but how do I represent them for a neural network ? unfortunately the CIFAR dataset iterator is not implemented by dl4j 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I am wondering if there is any way to add dependency on nd4s into my pom.xml

issue: so i'm trying to literally replicate an exact copy of the tests for DenseLayer for my custom layer, and for some reason I get [<-CODE->] in testMLPMultiLayerBackprop. DenseTest.java on OS X El Capitan. is this a known problem it looks like in the test it just gets set tolong seed = 6 so it looks like i get the same error when i run the existing test for DenseLayer not written by me at all 
solution: 

issue: I don't see a lot of example where I'm not interested in classification but simply getting a single probability at the end (so only 1 output node). Is there a lot to modify to have such a thing ? 
solution: I mean I know it's possible but I'm trying to transition from ScalaNetwork to DL4j and it seems like there is a lot of pre-build for classification but not if you want to play with the tools. 

issue: Can I ask another stupid question about the framework ? Why is it not coded in Scala with a Java API ? Well it's been pretty stable but I see the point. I just thought it would make the code immensely clearer with all the abstraction and make it performant with breeze. Well probably not more performant 
solution: but the cuda support is out of date - the ndarrays/tensors are brittle. complacent*. 

issue: I see, now I will abuse your generosity but how do you choose the number of layers and neurons by layers. I know a bit about the manifold hypothesis so I thought you choosed the number of layers based on the dimension of abstraction you wanted to reach. Do you really ? seems like the hot bit encoding is not really shrinking the input space. 
solution: sometimes if your input space is small your first layer size can be bigger. 

issue: agibsonccc: Still exactly the same issue with updated code: [<-LINK->] Maybe the number of iteration is too small ? Nope, it isn't that 
solution: 

issue: I am right now on a Windows machine and I keep getting the error messageWARNING: COULD NOT LOAD NATIVE SYSTEM BLASND4J performance WILL be reducedPlease install native BLAS library such as OpenBLAS or IntelMKLSee http://nd4j.org/getstarted.html#open for further detailsHow do I install OpenBLAS on Windows ? Yup I have added library to the path It still does'nt  find the blas library 
solution: 

issue: on 0.4-rc3.8? follow that link, last section starting with "For OpenBlas on Windows..." restart IDE + computer if necessary did you restart your computer? and yeah, gist full output 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: are you sure you're not using development snapshots? right, it is loading correctly, all good there there was a warning issue on dev snapshots, that afaik didn't happen in 3.8 
solution: AlexDBlack: No I am using the one downloaded from pom from the examples in github. 

issue: bit more to do yet Right now I'm finishing integrating our c++ core and making the unit tests pass that will be done today the bottleneck with gpus now is likely going to be the custom memory management that's being finished Likely - but I'm not guaranteeing anything We haven't benchmarked anything yet We're in completely new territory They'll be runnable early numbers are promising 
solution: 

issue: I'm trying to train an LSTM to associate natural english language questions to a pre-determined set of GIS queries. I've structured my data such that the input is a series of (vectorized) words in the question, and the output is one of 42 output neurons that map directly to one of 42 queries. It's my understanding that I can give it multiple inputs, then backprop a single desired output? that's what this article seems to say: [<-LINK->] but I'm trying to use the dl4j API, and I see this:Input data thus has shape [numExamples,inputSize,timeSeriesLength], and output data has shape [numExamples,outputSize,timeSeriesLength].  [<-LINK->] I understand why you would want to batch up the data for parallel training, but in this case I don't see how I can, since my input and output data will have different shapes? am I approaching this the wrong way? 
solution: sometimes you can use convolutions with mean pooling on the time series. 

issue: hm. actually i've loaded everything, but haven't updated ptx to actual one. so loader was working before merge and not to mention multi-gpu environment cases with cuda. :) 
solution: 

issue: so managing the parameters as they live on the GPU yourselves? or am i off the mark? (network paramters i mean) im kinda curious to learn, i guess staring into libnd4j would be a good start? :) 
solution: 

issue: exciting :) i will watch this space. the build is throwing some errors with lib atm... would those be useful to throw somewhere? anyway I'll continue my LSTM explorations using the CPU backend for now. I really love all the work you guys have been doing on this library... very exciting stuff :) 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: curiosity: memory management stuff aside (which im guessing means how the appropriate data gets from the datasets to the GPU memory and so on) is the basic idea of a cuda backend the same? Are the basic matrix dot products and so on implemented for the GPU but then the backprop implemented on top of it is oblivious to what\'s actually running the code and code like "backpropGradient" in BaseOutputLayer will basically be unchanged? 
solution: I can't expect people who know java to write fast gpu routines :P. 

issue: anyway. i like it quite a lot, keeping going :) ... oh and not to put a deadline to these things (and do feel free to tell me "when its done") but is there a timeline for 3.9? 
solution: 

issue: if one dominant framework emerges, it will be the one that is most aligned with the interests of its users. and by alignment, i mean incentives. 
solution: i don't think the big corp's have the right incentives to adapt libs to client/user needs. atollFP: and in any case, what you can imagine is a framework that acts more like a fabric, connecting as many pieces in the system together as possible.. 

issue: you\'re speaking of the Python crowd? "All your static typing and OO get in the way of my science?" I work with some stochastic modelers... 
solution: 

issue: chrisvnicholson: I've lived in Paris all my life, I'm glad I experienced it but if I could choose where to live the rest of my life I would choose the bay in a heartbeat For now I'm stuck in Lausanne until the end of my master :d 
solution: 

issue: It seems that when running the EarlyStoppingMINST example, it's looking for an already trained network?  I get errors like this: [<-CODE->] When I touch ~/DL4JEarlyStoppingExample /bestModelConf.json it complains about an EOF error. it's not creating any file I pulled the git examples repo an hour ago, and did a fresh maven import thanks! OSX el capitan I tried java.io.tempdir and ~ 
solution: You have to use System.getProperty("user.dir"). 

issue: on 0.4-rc3.8? 
solution: 

issue: I'm not familiar with deeplearn, so can't comment on that. but it's quite possible that there's a difference in default options or something (learning rate, weight initialization, gradient updater, or whatnot) hard to say without looking at both configurations side by side though post the configuration for dl4j in a gist - gist.github.com along with whatever settings you are using for deepnet 
solution: 

issue: what version of dl4j are you using? make sure you are using 0.4-rc3.8 I'm heading off now. someone should be on later though if it's not a version issue 
solution: 

issue: Some questions about the SequenceVector implementation:What is the effect when the epoch parameter goes up?\nWhat is the difference between trainElements and trainSequence?\nWhat is the difference between iterations and epochs?\nWordVectorSerializer.writeWordVectors() only works on Word2Vec, is there a SequenceVectors alternative? 
solution: 

issue: I still can't have 0.4-rc3.9-SNAPSHOT even with the good resolver I get missing dependency org.deeplearning4j:deeplearning4j-scaleout-akka:0.4-rc3.9-SNAPSHOT org.nd4j:canova-nd4j-image:0.0.0.15-SNAPSHOT I'm sure you can reproduce this error if you clean your local maven cache tbh 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: Why do you think I have those dependencies issues ? Apparently your new ui is great, I would like to try it :< [warn] problem while downloading module descriptor: [<-LINK->] : Unexpected end of file from server (122143ms)  [<-LINK->] Here is my conf in build.sbt if you want to reproduce the behavior I erased .ivy2, will try butI doubt it agibsonccc: Yes, even with dowmloading my entire .ivy2 I get the same issues 
solution: 

issue: i have a set of unordered sequences of which i want to apply w2v. is this the purpose of the sequence vector? is it ordered, or not? 
solution: "sequence vectors" is just a concept that encompasses learning embeddings for graphs or words in a sequence. no you don't get it, it's purely a feature representation. 

issue: hey@agibsonccc, I can't seem to beat this image size error: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid input: expect output columns must be equal to rows 250 x columns 250 but was instead [46, 187499] agibsonccc: how? just output the values stored? is there a method to spit out all of its internal state? actually it could totally be the "label index" property, I have no idea what that is so I set it to 0 yea I know what it is, I have no idea where there is an integer index for the labels is it an offset? 0 = 1851 = 187499 features 0 = 1851 = 3710 labels 
solution: 

issue: Milanvdm: any particular reason you want to work with sequence vectors specifically? there's only 2 implementations glove/word2vec for nlp and deepwalk for graphs 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] Isn't that weird that it increase a lot at start ? Yeah but sadly it's my error vs iteration .D I use SGD with minibatch of 100 
solution: 

issue: I cant get [<-LINK->] to work right. It runs but the evaluation gives weird and often nan results, model.output() gives all 3 weights always right near .33 each, and model.predict predicts only 0 or 1 even though there are 3 classes. Is there another owrking example of a basic DBN I can work from? somewhat. a little after my time but yeah i get the concept. ill bb thx 
solution: 

issue: so my Akka dependency error came from not choosing spark 1.4.1 in my pom.xml.  I had chosen spark 1.6. but... any idea why my memory footprint would keep increasing in spark? 
solution: an exclusion in my pom.xml?. 

issue: Hi all, if I want to use the LSTM net, but I do not want to use the fit() function, what I need is just to use the feedForward() and backpropGradient() directly. Right? 
solution: Because I want to do something like reinforcement learning. So I have a different loss function!. 

issue: Hi, is there a way of reading data of sparse format?  Not 0:0-0-0-1-1 but 0:3,4 ? 
solution: you'd have to create a custom record reader for that then. Yes. But most of my data are sparse. For example,  the feature dim is 1k, but most instance have no more than 100 features. 

issue: 11:35:02.143 [main] INFO word2vec.State2Vec - Plotting State2Vec don't use that for now please it was reported as bugged and was already recieved first fixing pass on it 
solution: 

issue: sinjax: two things: file an issue for that Second: we have thought about that for a long time now Hence it spawning this current native lib I've been building for a month or so We are replacing the Blas and all of the java operations That's in addition to the gpu stuff 
solution: 

issue: Hello once again,When I flatten(Nd4j.toFlattened) matrix in nd4j(which holds double values), I get vector of floats - how to avoid this? hmm, I experiment with both sollutions, and I get the same results. When I read data to matrix, I store data asdouble, when I callNd4j.toFlattened, I get matrix with floats. I'll check once again agibsonccc: Ok, now I have matrix and vector the same type (dataTypefunction returns the same values), but I get different value for coresponding points:-0.04265257343649864 vs -0.04265257400962632-0.04265257 343649864 vs -0.04265257 400962632 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: Side question :D I'm seeing an EmbeddingLayer implemented in the curent DL4J on github was that envisaged for use with sequences? Or not? 
solution: I don't know everything in that code base anymore.  [<-LINK->]. seemslike it expects to see an examples x 1 matrix and outputs an examples x embeddingSize matrix.. 

issue: Hi all, what artifactID and version of  org.apache.spark is using  dl4j-spark 0.4-rc3.9-SNAPSHOT > migrated to it and start getting a  java.lang.IllegalStateException: unread block data 
solution: 

issue: Does anyone know how to add dependencies to spark-notebook?  I'm having trouble finding it.  Copying my uber-jar to lib doesn't seem to work either. Ahh, need to use :dp ':dp' 
solution: 

issue: sinjax: "the architecture im using in keras has a one-hot embedding layer before the LSTM. is there a way to get a layer like that in DL4J?"yeah, the embedding layer you found is what you want :) It\'s in DL4J master, not in 0.4-rc3.8 thoughAnd BaseNDArray.assign is (was?) a known performance issue (in some circumstances) 
solution: 

issue: so AlexDBlack, after having done all you've suggested it's better but it doesn't work so well SO i've tried to abstract my problem Which is in fact finding the maximum of my input and giving it as an output So I feed my NN with 3 float normalized and between [-1, 1] and even with 2 layers he can't give good result when I train him to output the max The loss function gets very low, but not as low as if I sort the input By sorting the input the only thing he has to do is to output the input on the first node and obviously it's very easy for him and he does that well so, apparently max function is very hard for a NN, it's kinda surprising :D well max(x1, x2, x3) 
solution: 

issue: which are more up2date? dl4j-examples-0.4 or the website? (i assume the examples, but yeah, asking anyway) 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: desalinizing a serialized object doesn't seem to work. Please see the comment I made on (closed) issue [<-ISSUE->] . serialization seems have worked (file size is  31,581 kb) Deserializing a serialized ClusterSet object breaks saying "unread block data". Please see the comment I made on the (now closed) issue [<-ISSUE->] . serialization seems to have worked (created 31,581 kb file) 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: does the SNAPSHOT 3.9 works with Spark I got a "unread block data" error related in the past with serialization too ,   the 3.8 versions works ok with spark yes looks like so I crashes once the fitDataSet is ending 
solution: 

issue: I'll send you privately 
solution: i see. 

issue: I encode my weekday/hour to binary 
solution: 

issue: Has anyone dabbled with a custom weightInit for MultiLayerNetwork ? I notice these : DISTRIBUTION,NORMALIZED,SIZE,UNIFORM,VI,ZERO,XAVIER,RELU but I want a custom weightInit.. Pointers on where I can start/change for custom Init ? My implemnation is similar to Nguyen-widrow is this weight init already there (before I write my own) ? 
solution: 

issue: send us PRs it's likely not intentional We learned a lot of this as we went There's a guy who's been working on some of that file issues/send PRs ;) gh-pages is deeplearning4j.org that's the branch on deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I'm actually struggle with word2vec. Could someone explain: Where is the difference between epochs and iterations ? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: yeah, i've read the same thing about xavier/softmax/regularization. seems you can get far with the default values for the given domain. need to check out this ui, though:D wmeddie: can you not just tap into the spark logging thingy? it's a private api, but it works 
solution: 

issue: Running locally would actually be faster too I think. Due to openblas problems on Spark.  Is there a analogue to MLUtils.loadLibSVMFile in DL4J/Canova? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: training has been running for over 2 hours now. this can't be right? 
solution: 

issue: Habitats: why not? it's set up for multiple epochs deep learning takes a long time unfortunately if memory serves me it was a few hours to complete on my machine (6 core 3930k) 
solution: 

issue: I don't think that's especially good advice, to be honest. learning rates are too dependent on loss function, network architecture, activation function etc for a simple mechanism like that to work, IMO 
solution: 

issue: does the example take forever to run? i'm running it atm also, can't you just compile and run on the jvm yourself? 
solution: 

issue: good to hear, but did you manage to get the rnn example to work properly then? and does it generate Shakespeare-like samples? OK, looks reasonable, thanks hehe 
solution: 

issue: hello from vienna im new to machine learning i try to implement a new concept of a neuronal network the question is: should i use deeplearning4j or build a standalone program is there any documentation of implementing new neuronal network concepts? 
solution: 

issue: x12r13: mind filing an issue with a list of things our docs don't answer? we'd like to start consolidating some of the questions Milanvdm:  [<-LINK->] x12r13: I'd build something standalone 
solution: 

issue: it can help a bit to understand how gradients etc work I more or less agree but it really depends on what your goals are 
solution: there's a lot of extra stuff out there now. 

issue: Do I also need to install Visual Studio in order to use BLAS in windows?Also "For OpenBlas on Windows, download this file. Extract it to a location such as C:/BLAS. Finally, add that directory to your system’s PATH environment variable." I followed this instruction to install BLAS in windows but I am still getting the message "WARNING: COULD NOT LOAD NATIVE SYSTEM BLASND4J performance WILL be reducedPlease install native BLAS library such as OpenBLAS or IntelMKL". What might be the issue? 
solution: 

issue: yeah, a lot of the successes of modern deep nets comes from improvements on the optimization side. weight initialization, momentum, choice of activation function, etc 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I've got a question about nd4j syntax.I'm trying to have the subset of the 1st and 3rd row of the 3rd dimension of a nd-array. [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] For example the following code [<-CODE->] produces : [<-CODE->] But I want : [<-CODE->] Is there something I did wrong ? 
solution: 

issue: Question: I just changed my code from doing my vector ops with native java loops to using nd4j, and now the same program runs about 25x slower.  The program involves a lot of small (~200 element) vector additions.  Any idea what could be causing the slowdown? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, guys! Can sentences too long (like 5k+ tokens) be a problem for Word2Vec? Should we cap/split or it deals with it just fine? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. it's covered. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] gives me just the message "Dependency \'org.deeplearning4j:dl4j-spark:0.4-rc3.8 not found\'". Shouldn\'t that work out of the box? 
solution: dl4j-spark-ml probably?. fml I think the virtual machine I am using just turns off its network connection after restart XD. But instead of telling me that there is no internet connection IntelliJ just tells me it can't find the artifact... 

issue: Hi guys, I'm interested in the caffe parser of dl4j. Does anyone know if there is a working version? Can't find any information about the status or an example of it. ok, is there any information on how to use it? ah ok you're right, thanks 
solution: 

issue: Milanvdm: a dataset is just a pair of ndarrays they can be of any shape Have you sen this? [<-LINK->] Milanvdm: so what issue are you running in to if you already have ndarrays? If you need them formed in a certain way use Nd4j.concat 
solution: @agibsoncccNo, atm I have Sequences with SequenceElements. And each SequenceElements contains a List of attributevalues. So I can convert each SequenceElement to a ndarray. But then my Sequence becomes a ndarray with as elemens ndarrays.. 

issue: hiii have forked tweepy to my git accounti am currently using the python script to extract twitter data, but am unable to do so due to some missing library in tweepy. i am unable to figure out the problem. 
solution: It always goes for the underlying features or labels. 

issue: agibsonccc:  [<-LINK->] is very similar to what I need. Except that I use SequenceVectors. Thanks for the link, it forced me to refresh my knowledge about features and masking :)But it seems I will need INDArrays containing arrays as elements. Is this supported? (Can't find it at [<-LINK->] ) agibsonccc: Ill check it but I can follow now . I need a break ;) 
solution: 

issue: vvpreetham: What exactly are you trying to do, you said earlier: "Been trying to get the OpenBLAS on Nvidia GRID GPU driver" -- but OpenBLAS is a CPU based backend If you actually want to use OpenBLAS, take a look in /tmp/, there should be a (or several) file thats called something like jniloader(somenumber)netlib-native_system-linux-x86_64.so -- call ldd on it like that:ldd /tmp/jniloader*netlib-native_system-linux-x86_64.soand see if it tells you that something was not found If there is something like that, that's the reason why it doesn't load 
solution: 

issue: Let me kill my AMI and get a C3 or R3 instead of the G2 ! I was billing 70 cents per hour for G2 !! raver119: Some of us first read the doc before coming into gitter (to save trouble for all of you).. A mention in the doc actually would help… Thanks a lot for the support guys... chrisvnicholson: Thanks :) 
solution: 

issue: vvpreetham: removed GPU mention on the DL4J home page and github tag. will add it back when they're working. 
solution: chrisvnicholson: maybe add also a note here: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Thank you so much. would you please let me know how should I make data set: predict an output by 20 input. I saw many to one example but in there they use record reader again 
solution: Nd4j can wrap java arrays or byte buffers. 

issue: dl4j-spark is using 1.3 I just include it intransitively. HDP still only officially supports 1.3.1 :-( all of dl4j-spark "org.deeplearning4j" % "dl4j-spark" % "0.4-rc3.8" intransitive() 
solution: jamielister: dl4j-spark-cdh5?. 

issue: softgearko: so this is a known issue in 0.4-rc3.8. It's already been fixed on dl4j master one simple workaround is to split out your labels into separate files (assuming you are using a CSVRecordReader for example) otherwise, one other workaround might be to make a copy of the SeqRRIter code on github in your local machine: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Is dl4j-spark-nlp gone? Ah. I couldn't find it on mvnrepository for some reason.  I'll let SBT do it's thing. is setNumWords the same as Spark's setMinCount? 
solution: 

issue: wmeddie: why is that? i see it on current master wmeddie: hold on please. what versions you’re using? dl4j/nd4j i mean 
solution: 

issue: What does the model.score() value describe? When debugging the code it seems like that it is the loss function that calculates this value. When I run DBNMnistFullExample the value printed in the score listener keeps increasing. I was under the assumption that you were minimising the loss, not maximising it. 
solution: is there a RBM example of MNist with some "better" settings. no, sorry. there's cnn examples on mnist that are well tuned (the lenet one) but no properly rbm examples that I'm aware of. 

issue: @AlexDBlack Basic workflow question, after looking at the Optimizer tests and Multilayernetwork code for a while. Assuming I have computed an error function somewhere else. I then call [<-CODE->] to get the gradient with regard to the error function on my MultiLayerNetwork. Then I just call [<-CODE->] and that will perform the weight update? Is that the correct gradient function to call? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: I see, but I think linebreaks actually are stripped byreadLine(see [<-LINK->] ), meaning that tokens could get merged, right? 
solution: fixed both in examples and in current master. 

issue: has anyone encountered this error Could not resolve type id 'RnnToCnnPreProcessor' into a subtype while using spark and dl4j 
solution: 

issue: So any news on CUDA support? Has it made it into stable yet? I'd like to use BLSTM's on my GTX card. Available yet? 
solution: carlthome: not yet, still working on it. integration is still going on,@agibsoncccgot better solution there. 

issue: VenumadhavVedula: if you have exceptions you're running in to file an issue Yeah going to need a github issue  [<-LINK->] 
solution: Provide a github gist and if you can maybe some sample data that reproduces the problem. VenumadhavVedula: add that to the issue. 

issue: I'm trying to run RNN(LSTM). I think I need to normalize inputs before learning with net.fit(iter).  I know there is next.normalizeZeroMeanZeroUnitVariance(). However, I can't use it because the function is just for 2d matrix while time series inputs are 3d matrix. How can I normalize time series iterator? So I have to make normalizeZeroMeanZeroUnitVariance() function for 3D matrix (time series data). right? 
solution: 

issue: Okay noob question why is feature scaling required ? I have heard that it needed for quicker convergence of the optimization algorithm to find the global minima but that means without feature scaling it will take longer to converge.But it seems whenever I omit normalization I get incorrect results. Why is that ? It should take longer to converge not give me incorrect results.

solution: It will run except the first line. Will edit.. 

issue: You have made a great effor so far for us mortal functional programmers, actually contemplating on leaving R for good:). I have put de openblas.dll on the path, but that doesnt seem to do the trick. Sorry delay I cannot chat behind firewall Not working after restart (its an virtual image , so I guess reloading in) it will have the same effect. Any version of nd4j that will work w/o blas ? then I am back to my original question. ok thanks. I also have commas as decimal seperators in the output. Why is that? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: with regard to [<-ISSUE->] . I think what is confusing me is the order of the update flow. I thought I was meant to call updater.update() once per sample after I have done backpropagation to update the gradients, then retrieve the gradients, then manually update the parameters. However, from your comment it seems i should just call updater.update() once for all samples in the minibatch? 
solution: Right now im doing one because I was fiddling around with the temporal difference computation. I will upload my code later to the issue for clarification.  The way I understand it now the first 3 stepsDo forward pass through the networkTake network outputs, and calculate the error (externally to network)Calculate the gradient using MultiLayerNetwork.backpropGradient(INDArray)are meant to be done once per sample in a loop, and then the rest of the steps once. 

issue: AlexDBlack: after using the percentage overload function, am not getting the previous error. However, new exception is thrown now. I've updated [<-ISSUE->] with stack trace 
solution: 

issue: Hi everyone, I'm trying to train a RBM with a softmax output layer on mnist. Regarding the stepFunction I'm using the NegativeDefaultStepFunction. But when I pretrain the RBM the score is goining up. On finetune score goes down as expected. The loss of the RBM is just squared loss. Shouldn't it also go down on training? I got 80% accuracy so far so it seems to be correct. I was just confused, because when i use the DefaultStepFunction score goes donw on first layer but up on secon layer. ok, if i use the default one score goes up on first and down on second. And the accuracy is not that bad (80%) so i thought I'm on the right way

issue: fanganjie: unfortunately not right now. GPU backend is under major overhaul right now true. axpy calls on gpu do not have too much benefit 
solution: agibsonccc: @raver119thanks. I notice it takes a long time to get word embeddings even I use a 24-thread cpu. I was thinking that GPUs may help.

issue: Do you have any recommendations to deploying a trained model outside of the JVM? E.g. a RNN trained in DL4J and the weights put into a network usable in javascript? Yeah, that would be plan B Working with a company that uses a javascript framework for their mobile app. Looking to do on-device activity recognition Still in the exploration phase, but if it comes to that, I'll let you know I try to avoid js at all costs 
solution: But requires more know how than an average dl person has. 

issue: On the ND4j website there is a disclaimer that says "ND4J’s GPU backend is currently undergoing a rewrite. Please use nd4j-x86 for now.". When can we expect GPU code to be ready? 
solution: 

issue: While building my vocab my cluster went out of memory. My vocab comes from a 23GB csv file and it had 250GB of memory.Atm I'm using an elementFrequency of 1 to build it, what is a good way to find a decent value for this or is it trial and error? 
solution: 

issue: The code was something I came up with, I just  tried to simplify the DBMnistFullExample to mimic a simpler rbm on deeplearning.net that actually can plot some decent filters etc. I assume the RECONSTRUCTION_CROSSENTROPY loss function minimizes the reconstruction error during pretrain, correct? I started out trying to get the full mnist dbn to work out, but the score listener keeps giving me higher scores and my filter plots look messy (no patterns) 
solution: 

issue: OptimizationAlgorithm.STOCHASTIC_GRADIENT_DESCENT and Updater.ADAM together seem to work not correct. ADAM uses the iteration Number as power but this is incremented in case of  STOCHASTIC_GRADIENT_DESCENT *not where never done it before 
solution: 

issue: @AlexDBlack do I need to rearrange something else? With this: [<-CODE->] I am getting a 'shapes do not match' exception: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Shapes do not match: x.shape=[2, 2], y.shape=[1, 2]Dont quite get this one, since I clearly created a 2x2 matrix and adding rows with 2 entries each. sure, [<-LINK->] I guess there is a problem in that: the Q-temporal difference is computed like this:  [<-CODE->] So it does a forward pass per sample, but then i batch the error, so there is clearly a mismatch 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I am new to nd4j and dl4j. When I was going through some code examples I see parameters for nd4j like ENFORCE_NUMERICAL_STABILITY, MAX_ELEMENTS_PER_SLICE etc. Is there a place where I can find what these parameters mean? 
solution: 

issue: Is the Huffmantree needed when Im just loading in a saved model where the vocab and their vectors are known? 
solution: huffman tree is needed for training only. however, index is used for relation handling between vocabulary and row in syn0 table. By applying the addWordAtIndex() and addToken() I guess.. 

issue: Hi All..... sorry for very newbie question. I'm studying Machine Learning (Weka book, Caltech on line videos.. and others). There is something where I can found a very comprensive introduction about Neural Networks (and deep learning methods)? Not a general book about Machine learning but some thing oriented only to Neural Netowrks. Thank you 
solution: 

issue: Is there any documentation or examples for writing custom loss functions in dl4j? So that functionality is currently not available, but a work in progress? Also, is there a way to specify class weights via the API? 
solution: Not "we\'re a research org running an open source project". 

issue: I did a huge search for numpy ports a ways back when I was first starting - nothing came up or I would have been using your stuff! 
solution: I have a crap ton of talks on youtube. 

issue: I've been having trouble getting examples to run/run properly; can anyone verify I have the right versions of everything? I'm using Intellij idea and maven. my pom.xml contains: junit version 3.8.1, nd4j-java version 0.4-rc3.6, deeplearning4j-core version 0.4-rc3.6, canova-api version 0.0.0.14, nd4j-jblas version 0.4-rc3.6, and jblas version 1.2.4. Do these look right? 
solution: 

issue: um is it linked from either of those 1st 2 pages i mentioned? most ppl trying to install go to the get started page and/or quickstart page to try to figure out how to install everything. So link sample pom.xml from there mebbe? Well Im gonna back up my pom xml and try to rebuild it from that sample If I want to produce a platform independant jar, is <artifactId>nd4j-x86</artifactId> ok to use? 
solution: 

issue: Hello again, so I got the code in place, the stuff that I wanted to add, I have also created a new testcase to ensure the functionality is working as I'd want it tonow the pull request part? I just create one, and done for now? and I do a pull request to the master branch? or something else?thanks :) I checked out the project directly from the repo at dl4j and now that I am done I am just sending a pull req do I really have to first fork it into my github? or can I bypass that step? Done, my first pull request to DL4j :) 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I have a GPU that is pre-configured and runs fine on Python. If I want to use the GPU in DL4J, what do I need to do besides changing the dependency to nd4j-jcublas-6.5? And it says in [<-LINK->] that ND4J's GPU backend is undergoing a rewrite; does this mean that I can't use the GPU for calculations? Or does it mean it will be less effective? 
solution: And*. 

issue: Hello, I'm a bit confused by the configuration of a Convolution NN on the example at the end: [<-LINK->] So many times I saw nIn to not be included in a layer. I'm also not sure why nIn of the Input layer is the number of channel, so it learns automatically the col * row of each channel ? When nOut is 20 by example, does it mean that there is 20 output nodes by channel and for all channel ? 
solution: I see, so nIn in a MultiLayer network is auto infered except for the input layer right ?. 

issue: For Canova, is there any documentation on how to initialize it? Because I suppose I have to initialize() it with a FileSplit with the File I want to read, but it's not so clear. 
solution: 

issue: ymishory: please give us your OS, Java and Maven versions, and a gist of your stacktrace Milanvdm: also [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: raver119: Canova went out of memory after 41mil lines.I ran it on a cluster of 250GB memory and the file is 23GB. Im just reading each line as a Collection<Writable> and storing it in a List<Collection<Writable>>.  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: I read that section on autoencoders, and a bit more of the book that it references. it gives a good overview for me on a lot of areas. It's very in-depth, but I say overview because that's the level of detail I can absorb in one sitting :P thanks for the reference, it's bookmarked 
solution: this will be useful for understanding time series data as well as conv nets ;). 

issue: darrenfoong: mathematically, that's not that hard. the difficulty is that we don't have an easy way to get that out of the backprop codeit's not an especially common use case, so we haven't added methods in the for that yet darrenfoong: open as issue describing what you want. can't guarantee we'd get to it right away thoughas for code: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: What is the command for setting precision to double in nd4j? 
solution: dkmisra:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: just a pet project to get a feel for neural networks 
solution: Huh. 

issue: using a bunch of math fonts in a PDF file, then snipped out the character images 
solution: 

issue: Milanvdm: can you please file an issue, and include your source code there? so i can look what’s up there 
solution: 

issue: 0.05 could be ok, depending on data/loss function, but needing anything above 1.0 is unusual 
solution: 

issue: daidong: show me full stack trace please, gist of pom.xml and gist of source probably something wrong with layerSize on your side  [<-LINK->] daidong: obviosly, for rc3.8 please rc3.6 is outdated, especially for w2v it's wrong don't use -jblas from 3.6 please use nd4j-x86 as backend instead rc3.8 as well 
solution: 

issue: raver119: while running a while, another exception pops up. Do you think this is relevant with my program or tranining dataset? [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Can you give code example for collaborative filtering? I will file an issue 
solution: For a baked solution though yes I agree. 

issue: Well I keep getting  Unable to import maven project: See logs for details 
solution: You are importing it wrong. 

issue: safooray: : bottom right of your image/ide. Click "Add root" and "Add as Maven Project" right. yeah, it's usually really straightforward to do this 
solution: paste a github gist of the stack trace intellij reports. 

issue: safooray: my guess is java heap space 
solution: 

issue: Hello I have been trying to vectorize a csv file using canova-cli by following the steps on the wiki page of deeplearning4j/Canova repostiory but am getting stuck on last step which is the command to vectorize i.e ./bin/canova vectorize -conf csv_conf.txt . I'm working  with windows 7 32-bit system and am getting following error [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: 100 seconds is great. I guess my 4G memory just is not enough for dl4j load to work.  Gensim took 100 seconds and 5G ram 
solution: 6 core i7, 32gb, it's on a decent SSD too. 

issue: Hi, I'm having a play with DL4J in clojure. I ported the LeNet MNIST example with no bother, but I'd having some trouble using my own dataset with that same code. I suspect that it is a simple problem having to do with my use of the ImageRecordReader, but the docs are a bit sparse so I thought I'd pop in and ask about it. Here's a gist with the code and the error: [<-LINK->] (N.B.  the 52 inShapes do not match: x.shape=[10, 10], y.shape=[10, 52]is the number of images in my miniature test corpus) 
solution: basically you want your labels list to contain the strings of the classes... so 20 classesimage record reader assumes data format like /class0/img1.jpg, /class1/img7.jpg etc. 

issue: Hey, I tried to run a simple example but got error messages like: org.nd4j.linalg.factory.Nd4jBackend$NoAvailableBackendException 
solution: 

issue: Hi again! Now IntelliJ doesn\'t give me any errors for the constructor of the ImageRecordReader, but when I try to run the program, it gives meException in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/twelvemonkeys/imageio/spi/ImageReaderSpiBase Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.twelvemonkeys.imageio.spi.ImageReaderSpiBase with a lot more error messages in between 
solution: 

issue: raver119: should I just import the  imageio-core package from twelvemonkeys on my own or is there any better way to solve the dependency? 
solution: smodlich: yes, if you want multithreading. 

issue: raver119: I want to avoid setting up spark if it is not needed. What exactly do you mean by multithreading? As I understand DL4J when run on a single machine/GPU uses all cores available. 
solution: but tbh there\'s not to much "setting up" there. local works there too :). 

issue: Hello,everybody, I am a freshman.Can you tell me how to deal with this error?thanks. 
solution: 

issue: The array slice method in nd4j/nd4s does not work as I expected.   Is this a bug?  Here is a sample: object arrayTest extends App {val array = Nd4j.create( Array.fill [<-LINK->] (1f), Array(50,1,2))for(idim <- (0 until 3)) {val s0 = array.slice(0, idim)println( "Slice Dim = %d, shape = %s".format( idim, s0.shape.mkString(",")) )}} Result:  Slice Dim = 0, shape = 1,50Slice Dim = 1, shape = 1,1Slice Dim = 2, shape = 1,2 
solution: 

issue: my project sourece code paste  at here? 
solution: 

issue: no problem. But you'll need some way to quickly share code snippets if you need help. It makes it hard to provide support. 
solution: but if@agibsoncccneeds to see code, you need a way to show it. You could use your github account.. It allows drag and drop of files now.. 

issue: couldn't find any on a quick google. but a lot of the pasting sites become a way to share… opinions shall we say? and if you can do that anonymously that is… problematic. I sure don't want Gitter added to the list! 
solution: if you're big enough to have a physical presence then it'seasierbut not easy.. 

issue: agibsonccc: yeah i know you keep saying "file a ticket" but i must admit i\'m hestitant because i feel like i don\'t know enough about dl4j to have an educated opinion about any of this. i just assume everything is actually perfect and i\'m just a moron not being able to figure it out myself bgard6977: what kind of example is the tictactoe one? i'm using dl4j with scala and would love more examples, prefarably stuff that doesn't attempt to tutor the entire dl4j api+dl in general, at once 
solution: 

issue: what i'm missing for most of the examples are some thoughts around the choice of configuration used. sure, most of it is somehow nested into much of the docs, but it's often not obvious to tie it together 
solution: 

issue: For some reason it is not writing to the file. But it makes the file when it doesn't exist so I have no clue. [<-LINK->] Output of the sysout: [<-LINK->] 
solution: so, you get empty file, right?. 

issue: It needs a custom error function? 
solution: 

issue: It uses tanh for the output layer and uses an error function that averages over the number of labels. And discards things with 0 labels. 
solution: 

issue: Thanks@AlexDBlackfor this - great info. We will likely be engaging an expert also, but I am trying to get ahead of the game a bit. I am familiar with some data mining techniques but not so much with NN/DeepLearning. Just a clarification before I look into this a bit more on my own: You explained about structured and text-like data. What about "Vector" or Array type data where a single record Person has a property Interests where a given person can have several interests AND there is no well defined list of interests, so there could potentially be 1000\'s of possible values (and huge number of combinations) ... DO we get this out of the box, or is there a lot of work to do to work with such data? At one point I got the impression we have to try and map each possible value in an array to a single variable in the input (so 1000\'s of inputs) . Thanks again for any tips 
solution: 

issue: as for CPU stuff - that'll be faster as of 3.9 too, we've moved to a fully c/c++ backend with proper vectorization etc,andare switching how we link to native blas libraries (both give a big boost) 
solution: RBM calls the setScoreWithZ with the delta from taking the labels.sub(visibleSample), which is then used in the LossCalculation, I was under the assumption that the Loss calculation took z as the output, not the delta. Am I missing something here?. 

issue: raver119: I have tried with "parlar" word and I have checked my model and it looks like _[parlar,_Telefonu] -0.07957722991704941, ... but I got anything. 
solution: 

issue: endrcn: please do what i've said: get top 10 entries from your vocabulary, and print them out that could be done with: vocab.getWordAtIndex(0..10); print that out and show it to me using gist 
solution: 

issue: uhmm, can the imagerecordreader work with 16 bit unsigned short gray images? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: I got top 10 words but they are so long. If I paste a lot of space here. Therefore I upload the file to google drive and link here [<-LINK->] raver119:  [<-LINK->] It's my data set's top 10 line. 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] can i not use updater on my net directly? no, you can just run the main function 
solution: 

issue: endrcn: i’ve asked to print words, not their vectors endrcn: but as far as i see, there’s some format there for those Ngrams, note those commas between words so you have to pass words into wordsNearest in the same format not dataset... words... from vocab but only words, not vectors for them 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: i'm stuggling with reproducing it with mock datasets, so i suppose i'm the real problem is somewhere in between my chair and screen 
solution: 

issue: raver119: I hear there's some good things coming... vastly improved GPU support or something? Where should I be watching for that? Is it 4.9? should I be checking git, or the home page, or hanging out in the channel? 
solution: 

issue: all: if anyone uses snapshots, and willing to help with remote uiserver testing - please let me know 
solution: 

issue: Hello again  everyone ;) What do I need to configure to run the CDH5 examples on the GPU (Spark localmode)? 
solution: 

issue: is runningClassifier.fitessentially running one epoch? 
solution: mrvisser: fit(iter) will. it runs iterations. which is the number you specify. 

issue: Hi, I'm using dl4j and trying to get my cuda to work. I can run stuff on the gpu, but not dl4j. I'm wondering if my pom file is right. I've got the important info in a gist. I will include the link to the gist here. maybe someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong. [<-LINK->] thanks 
solution: 

issue: I\'m developing my nn as a jar file, using java because it\'s supposed to be platform independent. In my pom.xml it includes "nd4j-x86" among others. I\'m developing on windows system but want to deploy on a linux system. Will this work? 
solution: it contains everything required there inside. 

issue: Hello, would subset vertex work properly with a 3d tensor ? Would it acts as if the tensor was flattened ? 
solution: 

issue: I want to use Nd4j permute function for images. I am using OpenCV Java Preset library and my image is represented as org.bytedeco.javacpp.Mat. How can I convert my image to INDArray of Nd4j so that I can use its permute functions ? 
solution: it'd be based on the byte level representation likely though. 

issue: Milanvdm: sry, not yet. next morning :( 
solution: raver119: No worries ;). was looking other queued bugs first, and day suddenly ended. 

issue: atollFP: are you using 3.9-snapshot? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. It's a build.sbt. 

issue: null@1256267I can see that you've added an image, but can't see what it is... try again, or direct message me?  [<-LINK->] getting a 403 forbidden on that image link drag and drop the image directly into gitter so we do releases of all nd4j (and dl4j for that matter) artifacts at the same time so tracking any is probably ok 
solution: 

issue: yeah, it's not terrible, but it's not great either. you might try something like gradient clipping to deal with those outlier gradients, if you think they are an issue 
solution: 

issue: Milanvdm: so, i can’t reproduce your issue. Simple test i’ve wrote for it - just passing without any problems. Milanvdm: can you please try canova snapshot and run your task once again? codyhan: can you should your exception's stack trace? since that sounds more like oom issue 
solution: 

issue: raver119: Ill check the snapshot then because for me the test is failing even while running sudo and all that stuff. I have no idea why it isn't working. Okay. It is weird though that my toString is working on my Writable collection. I'll check the bytearrays. raver119: But the problem is that your test is also failing on my side. The last one. Its an assertion fail. In only counts 0 and not 1 So it doesnt write to that file. 
solution: 

issue: Milanvdm: canova 0.0.0.15-SNAPSHOT fails too for you? 
solution: 

issue: hi everyone. noticed that the serialization->deserialization of word2vec vectors is not working correctly. too complex problem for me to solve. can i report this somewhere? 
solution: 

issue: ozborn: Compile libnd4j and then set LIBND4J_HOME to point at where you cloned the libnd4j repo We're open to testers for osx, jus tdon't expect it to work on every version We're still ironing out a weird compilation error that isn't consistent across versions for cpu you'll also need a special version of clang for open mp do brew install clang-openmp look at the setuposx.sh I still need to do windows yet too fwiw 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I\'m having some problems with spark when writing in Scala. I am able to run the examples at [<-LINK->] , but when I try to fit it into my own program, it gives me the errorException in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: scala/collection/GenTraversableOnce$classat the linesparkConf.set(SparkDl4jMultiLayer.AVERAGE_EACH_ITERATION, String.valueOf(true)) ah yeah, I see now that when I included "org.deeplearning4j" % "dl4j-spark" % "0.4-rc3.8" into my sbt, it imported spark packages for scala 2.10 when I am actually using 2.11 
solution: 

issue: JohnTheDang: Any and all problems with No class def are 100% related to classpath It's likely a clashing spark version 
solution: 

issue: JohnTheDang: i'd recommend staying with 2.10 scala for spark and well, in general. there's too much incompatiblity with other frameworks for 2.11 
solution: 

issue: any code examples lying around? 
solution: Getting rid of pure java now. 

issue: Does ND4J support matrices with more than 2 billion elements? Nothing I can't work around.  I was just doing a naive port of some numpy code for a k-nearest-neighbor classifier.  That python code does some vectorized math where it computes a 50,000 x 50,000 matrix just to take its diagonal. 50,000^2 is too big. (Thanks for the reply) 
solution: 

issue: Habitats: Thanks for the recommendation, will move over to 2.10! Though do you know what the main differences between 2.10 and 2.11 are? Hi again, I\'m once again having problems setting up a spark instance using my own CNN. I can run the CNN example given at [<-LINK->] .I\'ve pretty much copy pasted the code from the example into my own code, but when I try to run it, it gives the error:Exception in thread "main" com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException: Could not find creator property with name \'id\' (in class org.apache.spark.rdd.RDDOperationScope)at [Source: {"id":"0","name":"parallelize"}; line: 1, column: 1] 
solution: basically you can pick any word from the end of the file and the lookup returns wrong vector that belongs to another word. 

issue: JohnTheDang: intellij ultimate has a good dependency tree thing; you could compare both projects thereIntellij has something equivalent too... or maven command line has something equivalent 
solution: AlexDBlack: mvn dependency:tree. 

issue: I tried to run the examples from the github page. I changed to gpu by replacing both x86 values with <artifactId>nd4j-jcublas-6.0</artifactId> Now whenever I run the examples I receive Failed to execute goal org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:1.2.1:exec 
solution: 

issue: shadakhtar: cnn, rnn, mlp... doesn't really matter. Issue 1 is the OutputLayer configuration. If your labels are binary, then it's usually sigmoid + negative log likelihood. Issue 2 is training data: that use case isn't implemented in the RecordReaderDataSetIterator (yet)if your labels aren't binary for each column, then you'll need to use new computation graph functionality 
solution: 

issue: Hello, so i'm trying to multithread my implementation of reinforcement learning. Is there anything dangerous trying to apply model.output from different threads ? Also, do I have to adapt my multithreading of my reinforcement learning to fit on spark or can I use whatever I want ? 
solution: 

issue: make a thread-safe wrapper that reads data into buffer, and gives it out to whoever asks for it? basically that's what spark does internally or dl4j w2v/d2v/glove works in the same 
solution: 

issue: Oops. How did I forget that CUDA was temporarily not to be used. (I have to say I haven't seen a glitch though. Not sure what it could have been doing without any x86 dependencies in the POM). A more relevant question (perhaps). I see "useDropConnect" in NeuralNetConfiguration. Does it use the dropout parameter (eg with dropOut(0.5) ) for the fraction of weights to be used instead of the fraction of units? 
solution: 

issue: are there any examples using the training UI that's been posted in this channel a couple of times? i can't seem to find any ah, that's the page i was looking for! thanks JohnTheDang: log them elsewhere? maybe i misunderstood what you meant. you mean the log spam from spark? 
solution: and spark will use it automatically. 

issue: Is there any way to suppress the outputs from training with spark? Makes it very hard to compare test errors Habitats: how can I set it to log somewhere else? where can I configure the logging? you mean PATH in windows or root in project folder? 
solution: files in the classpath are the files your program "sees" when it is running. 

issue: file an issue this is the time to get in feature requests 
solution: 

issue: Hi all! Got an exception while trying to use W2Vec [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: I am new here, I am trying to build nd4j with maven (command line), and I get an error about missing NativeBlas.h, I can't find a file like that anywhere. Any idea? I should have mentioned I am doing this on Windows 8.1. It happens, when cl.exe tries to compile jniNd4jBlas.cpp . Thanks. 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: So I'm not exactly sure how to use the preprocessor to achieve that. My target is not RNN, it's simply to have a single DenseLayer for all the depth of my tensor 
solution: 

issue: Hello! Is there any way to get the values which the function .normalizeZeroMeanZeroUnitVariance uses to normalize, to use them to normalize the test data too in the same way? you mean something outside of dl4j? Oh! I'll give that a swing! Thank you very much! 
solution: 

issue: drop in detailed feature request but are you sure you need frequencies in use? indexes are not lost anyway freqs, points are lost though. but why would you need them? uptraining? 
solution: with text serialization right now everything is cut off except of label and vector :). But training the SequenceVectors is already quite some work and for example wordfrequency could be handy to find certain links in the database. I just want to be sure that I save the complete model after a lot of computational work :). 

issue:  [<-LINK->] is there any further documentation on the ui? The webserver starts but all I see is this 
solution:

issue: zhangxing-love: did you modify that example for spark? you can't just submit the example to spark and have it work as-is 
solution: 

issue: "Thou shall not try more complex model without first trying deep multi-layer perceptron" 
solution: just found a strange occurrence, I had two very subtle bugs which were hiding each other.. 

issue: btw; as the utilization of a single training instance is pretty poor atm -- would it be possible to train multiple nets in parallel to get better utilization of my CPU? or am i missing something could i just fire two threads with different nets, or would that screw up stuff no, spark is slow as balls atm, so i'm not using spark for training 
solution: 

issue: how is the new backend coming along? I've seen there is a just hours old commit that seems to fix windows compilation? strange... I'm getting a null pointer exception from canova (also snapshot version) because it can't find the stopwords.txt in deeplearning4j-nlp but it is certainly there

issue: how stable is the 3.9 snapshot at the moment?  will I be able to train a model with standard layers but a custom cg? 
solution: it should be stable enough to use (x86 backend). I mean I'd suggest not using it unless you have to (bug fixes, new features etc). I can't guarantee that there won't be issues from time to time, but it's ok at the moment I think. 

issue: Qilewuqiong: there is nothing stopping you from streaming data into a Dl4J model or somehow distributing that model (manually) on a storm topology, Im just not sure why youd' want to do that for most use cases. If you update your model message by message, you lose all the advantages of data parallelism. If you update in batches, you dont really get anything from Storm any more because for any significant amount of streaming data, your model will probably fall behind in processing messages. You'd most likely use storm for preprocessing..

issue: hi, I am new to DL4J. my question is whether DL4J contains Reinforcement learning Algorithm ? I browse the all the package name in DL4J, seems it does not have any RL algorithm code in it, am I right ? 
solution: Not yet no. 

issue: Cool We'll be up and runing here prety quick I'm getting cpu up an running first Eg: running the tests with dl4j We're compiling on all platforms now We still have a bit of the CI to work on We have a mac vps,linux vps, and windows vps We need to install jenkins slaves on each of them though We can build it from source on each platform though which is a start the automation story isn't quite there yet devlop16: so here try compiling it that'd be a great first start sec Install msys2 Do you have that? for both libnd4j and nd4j, and try to follow these instructions:Inside a normal cmd.exe command prompt, run"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\\VC\\bin\\amd64\\vcvars64.bat"\nRun "c:\\msys64\\mingw64_shell.bat" inside that\ncd libnd4j; bash buildnativeoperations.sh blas cuda (OR cpu); cd ..\ncd nd4j; mvn ... (and append "-Djavacpp.platform.properties=windows-x86_64-mingw" if you\'ve built libnd4j with "cpu") These are instructions from@saudetwho set that up Basically clone libnd4j You don't need the windows branch I just merged all that stuff this morning When you get some time I'd love to walk you through it I'm going to work on documenting it after I get all the unit tests with dl4j up and running 
solution: 

issue: I'll bang my head against it a bit, I fought MKL into submission, so maybe I can find a way to make it compile on win 10 the mkl stuff was some weeks ago, when I first used dl4j

solution: 

issue: Hi， I read it from dp4j documentation, one can fit a neural network by first loading a csv  file, can I just fit a neural network with a nd4j data matrix? 
solution: yep. there's various fit methods... fit(INDArray,INDArray) and fit(DataSet) which can be used for that. 

issue: would it be a reasonable assumption to assume that training time is somewhat proportional to learning rate? i.e. lr = 0.1 would train ten times as fast as 0.01, given the assumption that 0.1 would actuallylearn 
solution: 

issue: treo: I was able to compile correctly the cuda vers with your sets! thanks , now I have a could not find artifact int the pom once I try to use it, I think it is still looking for it at maven central 
solution: 

issue: ThamaliW: looks like you didnt actually do training. Whether your output forms a probability distribution depends on your output layer 
solution: 

issue: treo: mine did not hang but crashes with java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError:    jniNativeOps.dll: Can't find dependent libraries 
solution: 

issue: ThamaliW: as@mschaarsmentioned, assuming your network is configured with softmax activation function, then output is a probability distribution over classes.Now in general, you won't get sensible results out of a neural networ without first tuning the network hyperparameters (learning rate, layer size, etc). Have you done this? ThamaliW: this is a good place to start on that: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Hi, is it reasonable that the training of a CNN should take up more and more memory as it goes on? My data set is not very large at about 10 mb, but after training for about 10 epochs, I almost always get some kind of out of memory exception, like Java heap space or GC overhead. I'm training using spark with about 80 (8 cores * 10 batchsize) examples per executor with 20 executors. raver119: should I file it as a spark or dl4j issue? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: Thanks for the previous reply! By the way. Is there a way to load from an InputStream and not from a File? 
solution: However, I can access HDFS files as an input stream and not as regular files.. 

issue: Is the .nIn property in the various CNN layers important for performance? I.e. will anything be affected if I omit writing .nIn in the layers? all right! makes it a little easier for me to write some sort of facade over the whole CNN making thanks

solution: I hope that makes sense. it might be a little inelegant, but it should work. 

issue: Hello there, I want to use a deep believe network to analyse my data. I have the data, and labels in a csv but I do not know how to load it correctly since I do not understand what the iterator does I red that one already. For me it is a bit different though since i am not using image data hi 
solution: 

issue: I was here last week and I was told that the cuda backend was being reworked for the rc3.9-SNAPSHOT. Is it done yet? 
solution: If you really want to use the latest snapshot, you will also have to pull down the libnd4j and nd4j repos and build them yourself. But as of this moment they don't quite seem to work (on windows). I haven't tried it personally on linux,  so I can't tell you if you are going to waste your time if you try it now. 

issue: snapshot is better not to be used for a day or two, last phase of code merge is going on 
solution: 

issue: I am on [<-LINK->] trying the example at the bottom. I am getting a compiler error for this line: "arr += arr2", and a few others. Are there any implicit methods that I have to import? I am trying to use nd4j in scala I was able to compile and run after adding the import and making a few other minor changes. I have filed an issue with a gist of code that worked for me. The issue is at: [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: I have been experimenting with DeepWalk, using scala with sbt, and used both core and graph as dependencies. However when I actually run, it looks for ND4J and gives aruntimeerror Thanks. I am puzzled though that this is a runtime error. I will read the getting started. Presumably I must somehow configure something so that dl4j knows where to look. Or is it enough to just publish-local? 
solution: 

issue: we're global or around a lot :P I'm in intermittently mpfaffenberger: We need to finish out our new gpu support yet 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: I am looking at the feedforward regression example of dl4j examples when it does DenseLayer.Builder().nIn(numInputs).nOut(numHiddenNodes).weightInit(WeightInit.XAVIER) what is the distribution used for the xavier initilization? I suppose that the call is to initWeights(int nIn, int nOut, WeightInit initScheme, Distribution dist) I see where it takes the first three arguments but what is the distribution? 
solution: 

issue: when I am using word2vec I encounter warnings like [<-CODE->] Can I ignore them? because I got a problem with 3.8 so I tried 3.7 to see whether the same problem happens when I am running word2vec jar file, its process always goes to sleep after some point Since I am using a cluster node, might be the problem that ND4J is not install on the machine? I tried to have a look at the jstack 
solution: 

issue: just to bereallysure it's initialized as as xavier? :) there's no reason, only need one I'll push up a fix for that now 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I'm using the SNAPSHOT version of the distribution to fix an issue with reset being called on a sequence reader where the features and labels are in the same file.  Not sure if there is also an issue when calling eval.eval(test.getLabels(), output); on the dataset that has been run through splitTestAndTrain as I'm getting the following error: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to get number of of rows for a non 2d matrix 
solution: 

issue: KeltoumBouqourou: I'd look closer at our computation graph stuff.@AlexDBlackwrote a lot of that and I haven't did much with it lately (mainly been on hardware acel) 
solution: 

issue: Another way to word this: "What is the gap in understanding?" Is there something we're not explaining? 
solution: I think that's a hugely missing piece in a lot of DL. but yeah, appreciate the input. i understand how it works, was more of an API related question. 

issue: Hi all, any news about this strange behavior? [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: hey team, just wanted to double-check that the DL4S API is still valid and will work with the current release candidate? I'm currently writing up a sample convolutional net that I'm going to present to a Scala group, and just want to make sure the API doesn't have any lurking issues okay just took a deeper look at the source...am I correct in thinking it's not really necessary for my use case? Also, I haven't been able to move past this problem. It appears to be an issue with labels somehow: [<-CODE->] Originally I thought it was an issue with Scala since it was passing an immutable list - but once I used a java collection it brought me back to this error@AlexDBlack 
solution: 

issue: Dumb question : I need to code in spark notebook . Any guides / examples available for me to get started code in scala spark 
solution: 

issue: atollFP: you can save the computation graph in a pretty much identical way to saving a multi layer network... use params() to get a row vector and Nd4j.write(), and just write the config as json "unexpected end of file from server" could be a network issue but yeah, we'll release 0.4-rc3.9 as soon as we can 
solution: 

issue: is there a reason you are building nd4j? use the release on maven central if you can no, it's a general issue with neural networks you usually want to keep your inputs in the range of -1 to +1, 0-1 or normal(0,1) distribution or thereabouts 
solution: too high or too low on either can be problematic, with common weight initialization schemes and activation functions. 

issue: subunithya: do you any serious reasons to compile from sources right now? right now there's code merge going on, so current master isn't stable 
solution: S. I tried to do some small changes on paragraph vector coding, which is in dl4j-master. I tried to change the the punct() in StringCleaning.java. 

issue: this is my pom file@raver119 [<-LINK->] this is the source code@raver119 [<-LINK->] raver119: here the exceptions [<-CODE->] raver119: here the jstack trace [<-LINK->] yesterday I ran both 3.7 and 3.8 version 3.7 version is still working exit however 3.8 version hasn't got any output since yesterday night raver119: issue filed

issue: Hi, when using dropout, what does .dropOut(0.75) mean? Is it that there is a 75 % chance for the neuron to be dropped or 75 % for it to be left? uhmm, what does dropOut(1.0) mean in dl4j? aha, so the opposite of the answer above then? 
solution: bennythedataguy: you may like our earlyadopters channel. 

issue: I wonder whats up with the ADAM/ADAGRAD/ADADELTA updaters, according to literature they should be at least somewhat comparable with RMSProp, but only with RMSProp my model is actually learning, with the other ones the score stays mostly the same ok, I can live with that The problem is probably that I have a vanishing gradient problem, the ADA* updaters almost all hit the termination conditon may be, though I have tried some unorthodox things, and yesterday came up with something where the model actually started learning Oh, I would have assumed that they find a good one on their one, with being adaptive and all that :D yeah, rmsprop came down from a score of infinity to something reasonable in 2 iterations ohh... where do I do that?

Even if I put it on 1000 (and there is no element with that freq), it stays the same. raver119: It seems illogical though that if I want a minWordFreq of 1000 and there are none, that it still builds a vocab?Here is my config: [<-LINK->] 
solution: so you're explicitly using vocab created earlier. 

issue: I recall the bit package in R does a really nice job of dealing with large quantities of bit data. It's great to be able to handle huge amounts of data without using 16x the memory. Still trying to figure out what I need to do to use a score function that depends on two adjacent outputs of a NN ... As I think I mentioned earlier, it would be enough to have two copies of the net with all parameters shared, with inputs and outputs from two adjacent time steps. I am not familiar enough with DL4J to know whether there is anything like that yet. 
solution: If you're trying to end to end training though (esp if you're doing a line search) you'd need an optimizer that could take in the whole gradient. Rather than hacking around that it seems like it'd be easier to just build on the computation graph itself. 

issue: check out the neural turing machines paper. [<-LINK->] basically deep learning has an can be used to learn simple algorithms it's the research frontier, though. also check out some of sutskever's work on neural gpu's.  fascinating stuff. for example, he's trained a system that does multiplications based on numbers up-to 20 bits. however, the system seem to learn multiplication for arbitrary precision numbers. if i recall correctly, no error has ever been found in terms of the networks ability to multiply correctly. 
solution: 

issue: could be the constructor you are using on the image record reader - wrong depth (1 instead of 3 - RGB) being used? hm, not sure then. I'd have to run it locally to debug 
solution: 

issue: raver119: Hi! I hope I'm not too noisy, but have you been able to make any progress on my issue? Quite the problem for me as I can't even train any networks <.< Thanks in advance!  [<-ISSUE->] aha, all right. So I'll just have to wait for the new update to come around? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: So what I\'m starting to understand (I\'m a complete newbie) is that "clustering" refers to distributing learning over multiple threads or servers.  Not what I am looking for: running dl4j in a server such as Tomcat to do problem-solving on a trained network.  Is this correct? 
solution: derrickaubin: problem is that there's 100500 different clustering sytems. derrickaubin: so, i.e. dl4j allows training on spark clusters, and trained network can be used anywhere. and on tomcat ntoo.. 

issue: JohnTheDang: , please try the following: Create your model, and then directly save its parameters without any training, and then reload them ( [<-LINK->] shows how to do that) - When reloading the parameters I have found that for some reason the memory usage does not icrease I was really surprised too when I found that, as you can see in this issue [<-ISSUE->] my memory requirements went down from over 10GB to just 3.5GB because of it 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: , if my understanding is correct, ComputationGraph doesn't make it possible to implement an error function depending on outputs from different time steps, but I have sketched one way to do it in an issue (as well as why this is quite an important functionality, IMO). 
solution: 

issue: yeah, just looking at the things you just wrote, I could barely understand most of it, and the same in the other channel, but still very interesting! Hope I can reach your level of skills someday! But are there any easy tasks that a beginner in open source could help with? Ah, that could be something I could help with! when it comes to things I want to learn, well, more programming in general as I feel that I still don't have a very good foundation in programming yet that sounds like a good starting point I have done mostly school stuff as I am at my last year of master in engineering physics mostly matlab stuff though 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: sorry.. i was trying to paste the mvn here (but am new to this app) and cant seem to be able to add markdown to the chat agibsonccc: ok.. i think i've figure it out.. here is my mvn ```  [<-CODE->] agibsonccc: so why am i not findingFileLabelAwareIterator 
solution: 

issue: I\'m having what I think is exactly the same problem as in [ [<-ISSUE->] ]. I see the resolution there was "Issue was with improper place for -Xmx option used. Solved." but I don\'t see what the actual /proper/ place for that -Xmx option is/was. Yeah so I'm using intellij and I feel like I've tried setting that property in every possible place. It also shows up properly in jvisualvm

issue: hi. i have a tab-deliminated (class \\t sentence) file for training. I useLabelAwareListSentenceIteratorto train aParagraphVectors. What is the LabelAwareListSentenceIterator equivalent of aFileLabelAwareIteratorto test the learnt model? raver119: thanks for your patience.. i just started with dl4j today. the simplelabelAwareIterator usage is still not clear in my mind if I use theFileLabelAwareIteratorthen the flow is like this  [<-CODE->] if i instead want to use asimplelabelAwareIteratori get stuck at this point...  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: I was trying to use BarnesHut Tsne to reduce dimension of the output of DeepWalk (all run using deeplearning4j - thanks for the really useful code). Could you clarify if the matix input in [<-LINK->] should haverows_ the vectors output by deepwalk (the getVertexVector method) or _columnsas these vectors? 
solution: Roger00: possible in principle, yes. We've had a few people try, but afaik more work is required. It's something we'll be looking into more in the future. 

issue: radiodee1: what prevents you from using RBMs?

solution: Use that as a reference as you're building your neural net. 

issue: Does the DL4J package 'phone home'? I see weird HTTP connections to Google Analytics when I run my training code agibsonccc: Was it announced somewhere? 
solution: I think it would be good yes, because I find it rather disturbing. 

issue: When training a model for regression I call fit with a DataSet iterator which produces both input and output DataSets. Once trained I'm a little confused about how to evaluate the model on an input and compute the error It seems the methods are named with classification in mind. What should I call? 
solution: 

issue: subunithya: I'd strongly suggest using the versions of dl4j and nd4j on maven central, unless you've got a good reason to mess with source there are known issues with nd4j master anyway (due to switching over to a totally c++ backend), so even if you build from source you won't be guaranteed a stable experience there whereas 0.4-rc3.8 on maven central is fine we don't have a convolutional autoencoder implementation at present 
solution: 

issue: Could you provide a good link , how to work with  hdfs data using deeolearning4j *deeplearning4j 
solution: as long as you can get RDD out of there - you’re able to use it with dl4j. suppose i put mnist data into hdfs  and by using yarn how i can apply cnn. 

issue: AlexDBlack: I am looking at putScalar, and it takes a singe value for index, so if I have anINDArrayof 1 Row and 5 Col and I want to change the element at the 4th Col I do a putscalar(4, value) right? Quick question@AlexDBlackND4J uses the Java Double.Nan and so on for NaNs right? 
solution: it's ultimately a double[], float[] or offheap ieee floating point representation, so yes. 

issue: I'm not sure on the best approach... for x/y normalization, you can do (x-min)/(max-min), but that'll lose your relative position on the axis (can't learn intercept) you should be able to derive slope in terms of the x/y normalization probably 
solution: I think I also need to normalize x and y separately because they can span very different range. 

issue: raver119: Hi raver119. This is about the issue  POM.xml dependancy issue [<-ISSUE->] . I see that the issue is closed. But I am still getting the error when I compile my code.

issue: raver119: I have uploaded my file to [<-LINK->] .  It is fundamentally the example from ParagraphVectorsClassifierExample.java with a few changes.  The place that crashes is commented CRASHES HERE. raver119: Now it crashes at line 279: [<-LINK->] raver119: When I serialized the paragraph vector itself, I got an error (I can reproduce in a few minutes).  Or is there something else I should be serializing? 
solution: 

issue: derrickaubin: on line 224 just add to builder any iterator. and everything will be fine. any non-null iterator will suit derrickaubin: that's because you hadn't deserialized paravec model configuration != model configuration is just a set of parameters not a vocab, not a weights  [<-LINK->] you just build empty model without any data

issue: hi@agibsonccc! hey@raver119-- just checking out word2vec, great work / article. 
solution: 

issue: hello. I'm trying to setup pom.xml with nd4j-jcublas-7.0 or nd4j-jcublas-7.5. jar gets downloaded, but I still get org.nd4j.linalg.factory.Nd4jBackend$NoAvailableBackendException is GPU support working at all at the moment? 
solution: 

issue: Hey@agibsonccc- I want to evaluate Word2Vec with the the intent of putting it in production. I am right testing with rc3.8 and am impressed with all the work you guys have put in. I wanted to check into see if there is any impact with all the backend changes you folks are making and if I should wait, or if there should be minimal impact. 
solution: 

issue: vasants: there were few minor fixes to w2v, that are not reflected at snapshots yet. 
solution: 

issue: npan1990: why not use UNK or some other placeholder? 
solution: special token for unknown words, or any other similar placholder. So in this case I get a vector for this token.. 

issue: Hi again! Because I want to save each image that is misclassified while evaluating my test data, I am trying to set up some way to manually save all the file paths to the images in the test files and copy the images that get misclassified into another map. But the problem I have right now is that I can't find a way to save the URI to each image in the same order and batch as the recordreader/recordreaderiterator does. Is there anyway to get the URI from the recordreader/iterator when I initialize them, in the same order? AlexDBlack: Seems to be working with some hacking. Thanks alot! 
solution: 

issue: raver119: - okay. any idea on when the fixes to w2v will go out? raver119: - what do the fixes impact? 
solution: reported & fixed issues are linked to the pr.

solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: So, I should append tag to each training data, even if it's useless? 
solution: you need labels in order to do backprop. 

issue: ok mr@agibsonccc, i will check again my source code and will be back soon 
solution: 

issue: hahaeason: yes, by default labels are taken from the directory structure... you provide the base directory, and a list of classes (subdirectories) as per [<-LINK->] maheratashfaraz: not sure what's going on there... what results do you get if you simply use the ScoreIterationListener? that should print the score of each minibatch ThamaliW: "The error is in these lines... I have to convert o to a 3D INDArray. But here i am converting to 2D."right... you need 3d... because you are doing 1 example, it will be [numExamples=1, nIn, timeSeriesLength]

issue: Hello, everyone. Who knows why Neural Network can be configured the same layer for many times? The example codes like that. [<-CODE->] layer 2 is 3 times, layer 3 is 2 times from [<-LINK->] Ok, I see, I just confused. Thanks for you reply. ^_^ So Strange, I can't find the original example above. I found one from someone's fork. 
solution: 

issue: Is there any example of a network with multiple independent outputs (to share statistical strength and save a lot of training time)? I am not sure how to set up a loss function (eg where there are a set of boolean outputs and loss functions for each are added. Is 3.9 needed to do that? You could just do the output layer with that? I am happy using beta. It will be stable by the time I am finished - lol. 
solution: 

issue: Hi all! Assume that I want to use a word2vec model (e.g. The google one) and then to expand it with new words. This might be the case of entities that did not appear during the google training. Is there a way to expand the dictionary with dl4j ? Thanks! 
solution: build new model, bigger one, or just drop non-existent terms. 

issue: Hello, I have a question. Why the layer 0 \'s nIn is "one" ? Codes are below . [<-CODE->] The example code is from LenetMnistExample.java 
solution: nin on conv nets == channels. that number will usually be 1 or 3. 

issue: agibsonccc: hi. I am having difficulties to print the score during each iteration of epoch for each training sample. could you please advise me. This is my code  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: When I first started using dl4j I made a mistake in my data loading, and all data that went in was just straight zeros... after a while it learned to just predict the labels that came up most often 
solution: 

issue: This is a really basic question, but I can't seem to find documentation on it. How do I load a model and query against it (like in a scala repl for instance)? If you could point me to relevant docs that'd be just fine 
solution: 

issue: Elroch: thanks! I got distracted at work yesterday and didn't check back, but I will try that 
solution: 

issue: Not really ;/ If you want the underlying array you can do .data().asDouble() yeah but it depends on what you want to do with it 
solution: but you should note that shape information gets discarded. 

issue: Hello, a quick question:  Because I'm using comp graph a particular setup, I can't use a DataSet Iterator. So I wanted to check the difference between fit(DataSet) and fit(DataSetIterator).

solution: if you're just looking for caffe from java or something look at the javacpp-presets. 

issue: hi every one @agibsonccchi i want Monitor and Debug Neural Network but get follow error please help me  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: I don't actually follow you about SGD anc CG being completly different. If you used the whole corpus instead of minibatch, it would be the same gradient descent no ? (What I mean is that once you've extracted your minibatch, you do apply CG on it no ?) 
solution: anyway, regardless of whether you are using SGD, SGD + line search, CG or LBFGS, the network only operates on one DataSet at a time. 

issue: agibsonccc: You were involved in Like2Vec? [<-LINK->] Mike taught in Pitt (Where I was a student.) Ahh.

issue: derrickaubin: what are you trying to do? Why are you using 3.9-SNAPSHOT? 
solution: 

issue: Read our quickstart? [<-LINK->] Read the intellij docs for extra troubleshooting? [<-LINK->] If you don't know what maven is or haven't used a build tool before: [<-LINK->] dkmisra: yeah eventually it's still a general packaging problem even if we release one it won't be optimized for the number of cores on your machine ;/ cuda will have the same issue 
solution: 

issue: treo: I am using snapshot because there was a bug I was running into that was fixed in snapshot. 
solution: derrickaubin: if you're going to use that you may want to hop in our earlyadopters channel. There's a bit of ongoing work that should wrap up today or tomorrow to finish out our new c/c++ underpinnings for cpu. gpu is being worked on concurrently there as well. 

issue: AlexDBlack: Hi, I am trying to add the deeplearning4j sentiment analysis program to spark pipeline. I adding it, i have to override the predict method. Given below is my predict method. The problem is that I get always 0 as the prediction. Can you help me for that. @Overridepublic double predict(Object o) { [<-CODE->] Yes we discussed about an error I got last time. But not about this issue. Thanks a lot 
solution: 

issue: Hello, MultiLayerNetwork's output() and predict() method, Which one do I should use when I want to calculate the test-data-set error and F1-score etc. ? Ok, Im confused with the eval.stats() result. Because Now I run the network, stats all items is 1, but I didn't get 1 result in previous train with every same params previous 
solution: you'll get variability from run to run just based on random parameter initialization, unless you set the random number generator seed. 

issue: AlexDBlack: the code for NNs is generally not intended to be threadsafe, right? 
solution: yeah so the way I was doing is the following: I have a monte carlo simulation that creates high throughput workloads of pretty much anything data management related. I do the deep RL update step batched and synchronized, but asynchronous to the RL step execution. The only thing that I need 'realtime' is the forward pass to get the argmax of the Q values. 

issue: Hi, how to get the code change at [<-ISSUE->] .    I am using git clone [<-LINK->] ,  and intelliJ to download all necessary jars. My current version should bedl4j-spark-0.4-rc3.8.jar dl4j-spark-0.4-rc3.8 
solution: 

issue: In other words, in the pom.xml file, I have <nd4j.version>0.4-rc3.8</nd4j.version> and <dl4j.version>0.4-rc3.8</dl4j.version>,  should I use any different version number there? 
solution: 

issue: are you running it through intellij? you can have multiple JVMs installed on a system, and have intellij configured to use a certain one so check project sdk settings if so otherwise: I'm not sure then. I haven't seen that issue before 
solution: 

issue: Hi - I am trying to understand a dl4j-example, it is about GravesLSTM and using ::rnnTimeStep(), here is the example: ComputationGraphTestRNNIn the example, there is [<-CODE->] What does each value "3", "5", "6" (timeSeriesLength) mean? So in the test, only the test is tested, not values? [<-CODE->] only the shape is tested? 
solution: but looks like its a mere assert statement to make sure the shapes are same. 

issue: I have a question, suppose I normalize the input and the ouput of my nn with 0-mean and 1-std in a regression problem during the training phase how should I rescale the output of my network in the test phase? I really can't get this would be glad if someone can help me, thanks! 
solution: 

issue: Hi, Is there any example for tf-idf implementation using deeplearning4j? It's kinda difficult to make it work based on java API page. Thank you@agibsonccc. I will also file an issue. 
solution: 

issue: raver119: : quick question - I am using snapshot 3.8 .. I want to get the word frequencies from the vocabCache in word2vec. This works fine when I train initially and have the word2vec object in memory. However upon saving - using the writeWordVectors method, this word frequency info is lost on loadTxtVectors. Also, the writeFullModel method doesn't work because the cache is not an instance of inMemoryLookupCache. Thoughts on how I can make the word frequency info persist? 
solution: 

issue: I found a ridiculous small typo in dl4j-documentation. [<-LINK->] is not on github, is it? 
solution: yeah, the website is open source... see the documentation/website section here: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Yes, but it kinda limits my own implementation of a Graph class because I can't use my own Vertex/Edge objects in an efficient manner.But the implementation of Deepwalk for Seq2Vec supports a more general implementation? 
solution: 

issue: thanks@agibsoncccthe first set of questions are pretty basic, and then will get more intricate from there. so the first few concerns regard the basic "flow" of events, from Pre-Training through Production...first off: on the site, 3 different types of data are presented: Training Data, Test Data and "Dev" data. I get the first two, but what about Dev Data, what is that (and what is it used for)? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: if my whole data is in one batch is one epoch equal to one iteration? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: you keep saying "all at once" but this can\'t actually be true! (?) you mean if I have a 2 layer net, both layers will receive inputs at the exact same nanosecond? 
solution: so@agibsoncccat t1, my 100 ndarrays are passed into all the layers of my net, essentially at the same time, and then, the output layer produces output in the form of an ndarray of weights/coefficients, correct?. 

issue: Looks like its a miss on developing ListDataSetIterator. And you do need the labels set to for training when doing supervised. Can you add this issue onto the issue you have open? If you want a faster fix I'd recommend going the initial route I mentioned by creating your own iterator leveraging existing code for now 
solution: 

issue: rburton: you might want to read [<-LINK->] it is not exactly word2vec, but if you are looking for a very highlevel introduction, that may help 
solution: 

issue: I'm interested in contributing.  Can I just work on any issues or the ones that are labeled as bug or enhancements?  Thanks! 
solution: 

issue: skongum02: hi. there's not much of a restriction on what you can work on... bugs, new features that have issues, etc or even new functionality that doesn't have an open issue, if you want it's not a bad idea to run things by us (or make a note on open issues) re: what you are working on (to avoid duplicating work, etc) but otherwise we're pretty open to contributions :) vaibhavdpatel: so again, we don't have reinforcement learning functionality yet youmightbe able to use DL4J for that, but don't expect it to be easy some discussion here: [<-ISSUE->] that's exactly what is discussed at the above link... 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: btw yesterday you told me to go read the manual (which I already did) and cited the book at deeplearning.org. did you know that the main chapter (on Modern Practices in Deep Learning) is not available for public consumption?!? 
solution: 

issue: Guys, I have a conceptual question in the working of the training. So  few days back I asked and was told that if a DataSetIterator iterates over the entire dataset in each .next() then the number of epochs and number of iterations are essentially the same. My question is,  I assume the possibility of iterating over smaller portions of the data set must have provided some use case (better results?) can some one who has more information on this please coment?@AlexDBlack@raver119?Also if I call train with a datasetIterator that has a batch size of imagine total/10 (can provide 10 batches) and have defined number of iterations as 5, the fit() method will iterate 5 times over each batch? so in total of 10 batches * 5 iterations ? or am I all worng 
solution: 

issue: raver119: Could you point me in the right direction for the Seq2Vec serialization? Do I need to create a Json String for my Sequences and be able to reconstruct my Sequence with this Json String? (Then I can already code this) Oke! 
solution: 

issue: I transformed my SequenceVectors to a Graph now for Deepwalk, will it stay the same in rc3.9 as I see a lot of new code regarding Seq2Vec and Deepwalk in the Spark_NLP branch? 
solution: yes, it will stay the same. Oke :). that's done as preparations to migrating them into spark context. 

issue: AlexDBlack: Hi Alex, i'm just trying to use DL4j with IntelMKL. Correctly installed on win64 but still getting the warning  message WARNING: COULD NOT LOAD NATIVE SYSTEM BLAS. Is there something to configure inside DL4J ? I'm using Intel Math Kernel Library 11.3 for Windows* 
solution: 

issue: raver119: what would you suggest is the best way to build a tfidf vector in r3.9snapshot avoiding the dependency problems i am running into? 
solution: 

issue: treo: thanks for the answer. Not a good news. Do you mean MKL is a trouble to configure inside DL4J? 
solution: 

issue: It has less to do with DL4J, and more with the way netlib-java loads it you have to have mkl redist on your path, aswell as the openmp libs that intel ships, and you have to copy mkl_rt.dll to libblas.dll and liblapack.dll and you have to add System.loadLibrary("mkl_rt.dll") to your application 
solution: I've thrown everything in a single directory and added that to my path, the directory then looks like this: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: I've been here a few times asking similar questions but I can't seem to get past this. I'm using r-3.8 and I am trying to integrate with spark. My training set in total is around 250 MB. Every time I train, I get an OutOfMemory error thrown. I've been able to successfully use the MultilayerPerceptronClassifier class that's native to spark with the same training set. It appears to be crashing in SparkDl4jMultiLayer.java while trying to process this resultsParams.foreach(a); Looks like line 351 in r-3.8 I've maxed out my driver and executor memory and framesize Also noticed the framesize seems to jump to around 1.7 gb and my training set is not neraly that big. no clue why this is happening. nearly* 
solution: 

issue: raver119: Word2Vec(v.3.9-snapshot) only supports vectorization of unigrams and not ngrams, correct? 
solution: 

issue: Do I need to worry about the message "could not scan file org/nd4j/linalg/cpu/javacpp/linux-x86_64/libjniLoop.so ..."? I don\'t get this message when I run the DL4J examples project, but in a new project where I added the dependencies I am 0.4-rc3.8 for both dl4j and nd4j 
solution: 

issue: can you run this on a single machine (spark local) and run it in visualvm? might help to identify where the memory is going... without more to go on, I'm only able to guess at the causes at this point

issue: I have a question. What is actually necessary to have in the pom.xml to be able to run a CNN with spark? 
solution: so nd4j-x86 for rc3.8 etc. 

issue: This is a question about IntelliJ, but after a lot of googling and still not finding a solution, I hope someone here can help me instead. When I run a program in IntelliJ, it always defaults to -Xmx4G no matter where I change the JVM options in the IDE. Where should I add -Xmx8G to get my wanted effect? 
solution: alexkarargyris: if you just want caffe in java there's a lot of stuff that does that already. 

issue: Can't seem to find the vm options, do you mean in the settings pane of IntelliJ? I am writing in scala using sbt to build, so I have added -xmx to the sbt options in the Build, Execution, Deployment section

issue: renanlalier: could you please ask your question in other words? i can't understand your question :( 
solution: 

issue: It's possible load data json for training using ParagraphVectors? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: For example, there is a standard amount of epochs, iterations and BatchSize, should I set in my build of ParagraphVectors? 
solution: @raver119 if iterations != line .What does this mean?Lines vectorized so far: [3]the 16458 lines of the training file are being read or only three ?. so all you training corpus will be loaded in blocks of 1000 documents/lines per each thread, and there will be 16458 passes over each of them. 

issue: anyone encounter this error when using deeplearning4j on spark: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: No updater to combine was trying to run the example codes ok 
solution: 

issue: neverPick: There's nothing that I can see that would prevent it from running on Android, but we'd have to work on the distribution a bit, and get a build for the the native code...

issue: Hi. I'm trying to implement RNN for classification.(Many-to-One case)My input csv-file is respectively constructed, as follow~ 3200 bytes raw data ~ (Linefeed, i inserted \\r\\n. i hope that it means each time step is 3200 bytes)~ 3200 bytes raw data ~ (Linefeed)...and so on...Each input csv-file has different length(means variable time series)and are multiples of 3200 bytes(except Linefeed)Each label csv-file is constructed, as follow1, 0, 0, 0, 0 (or 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, and so on. total 5-class labels. a single-row)What could go wrong?Do i need to change configuration in Input csv-file?i plan to use SequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator-class does my approach go wrong? 
solution: 

issue: Adnandev123: could you please do me a favor, and file an issue? I need to make sure ppl won't get caught in this trap with hundreds of gigabytes of required memory 
solution: Adnandev123: and unfortunately i can't check that right now. So reminder won't hurt for this one. 

issue: zhangluoyang: please use gist.github.com for large messagesnow, do you get any output running other examples? like "Score at iteration ..." messages in CSVExample? ok, so it\'s probably not a logging configuration issue then, as you can see "Score at iteration..." messages what hardware and how much memory have you allocated? you might be having a lot of JVM slowdown due to (very nearly) running out of memory zhangluoyang: hm, I'm not sure tbh. that's enough ram what version of java, btw? JohnTheDang: @nyghtowlis the best person to ask

issue: Hello, may I ask if ComputationGraph from SNAPSHOT 3.9 still works? Cause it throws me exceptions in the last few hours (i am using it a lot in my system) 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: sounds awsome! Im starting my master in machine learning after the summer, im very interested in the field! Anyway a fellow programmer could help out? 
solution: Look at what's out there in python land that is reinforcement learning plus numpy. I built nd4j like that on purpose. btw@agibsoncccdo you think what im trying to do is plausible with DL4J at the moment?. 

issue: agibsonccc: @treoim quite new to both this field and DL4J, im thinking about whether or not something like this might work  "fit( new Dataset( prevOutput, reward + gamma * max of currentState))". What do you think? even though RFL isnt supported yet, could this actually give me reasonable results? Or should i explore other options? (even if it takes long time it dosnt matter so much) 
solution: You want to basically train a backgammon bot, but I don't quite get what your inputs and your outputs should be. 

issue: AkshitaT: i've merged tf-idf to master today and it should work now 
solution: 

issue: Milanvdm: i wouldn't recommend using it right now, i  just had to merge long-living branch to avoid massive code divergence i mean you could test that, and if you'll find something i'll fix that, but don't estimate on it right now without testing there were 7k lines of changes in total, and that started becoming a problem, so i had to merge. dl4j-nlp etc tests were passing, though ClassPathResource is for loading things that are in your jar, or within classpath 
solution: 

issue: how to load files external path with ClassPathResource in ParagraphVectors?I\'ts not working:ClassPathResource resource = new ClassPathResource("C:\\Dados\\recortes\\publicacoes") 
solution: 

issue: for back propagation NN - simple problem stuff is DL4J overkill? 
solution: jwrgorman: well, maybe. there's nothing wrong with using dl4j for simple MLPs, just there's a lot of functionality you won't use. for example, [<-LINK->]. 

issue: guys I have some problem loading the configuration from a json file I am using this:  [<-CODE->] but it gives an error: java.lang.NullPointerException and I found out that the line where the program stop is the one with savedNetwork = new MultiLayerNetwork(confFromJson); it can't execute that line...do you know why? my conf file is saved correctly, has some structure in it {"layer" : {"dense" : {"activationFunction" : "tanh","adamMeanDecay" : 0.9,"adamVarDecay" : 0.999,"biasInit" : 0.0,"dist" : {"normal" : {"mean" : 0.001,"std" : 1.0}},"dropOut" : 0.0,"gradientNormalization" : "None","gradientNormalizationThreshold" : 1.0,"l1" : 0.0,"l2" : 0.0,"layerName" : "genisys","learningRate" : 0.01,"learningRateAfter" : { },"lrScoreBasedDecay" : 0.0,"momentum" : 0.9,"momentumAfter" : { },"nin" : 12,"nout" : 50,"rho" : 0.0,"rmsDecay" : 0.95,"updater" : "NESTEROVS","weightInit" : "XAVIER"}},"maxNumLineSearchIterations" : 5,"miniBatch" : true,"minimize" : true,"numIterations" : 1,"optimizationAlgo" : "STOCHASTIC_GRADIENT_DESCENT","seed" : 12345,"stepFunction" : null,"timeSeriesLength" : 1,"useDropConnect" : false,"useRegularization" : false,"useSchedules" : false,"variables" : [ "0_W", "0_b", "1_W", "1_b", "2_W", "2_b" ]} treo: okay, sorry I'll do AlexDBlack: thank u shouldn't it be written somewhere also here [<-LINK->] ? 
solution: and while you are at it, skip the documentation generation too :D. 

issue: That looks like a dependency problem, how does your pom look like? (post it as a gist) hugstone: stop. post a gist of your full pom file instead of screenshots of part of it 
solution: 

issue: treo: sorry, i am new, the pom files are just like the [<-LINK->] ,  they are not  modified, and my platform is win64, IDE is eclipse. thank you! 
solution: hugstone: grab pom.xml from examples. 

issue: I am trying to import import org.deeplearning4j.ui.weights; because I want to use HistogramIterationListener(1) in my net but it says The import org.deeplearning4j.ui cannot be resolved what am I missing? 
solution: I have this in my pom.xml. hm... that's really all it is. unless you don't have auto-import or whatever set up in intellij... (assuming you are using intellij). 

issue: Hi there, I got a question related to [<-LINK->] Assuming I trained my network on 1.000 timesteps. Now I am predicting timesteps 1.000 to 1.009. Some time later, the real world reached timestep 1009. The real-world values for timesteps 1.000 to 1.009 differ from the predicted ones. Before going into prediction for timesteps > 1.009, can I tell my network "Hey, forget about your prediction, this is the real world"? As far as I understand, I would have to do a complete refit on my network, for timesteps 0 to 1.009, right? 
solution: 

issue: I would like to know how I can use the build of my learning process. I feel that is too slow with high number of file, although in my testing machine.my configuration:ParagraphVectors paragraphVectors = new ParagraphVectors.Builder().learningRate(0.025).minLearningRate(0.001).batchSize(1000).epochs(1).iterate(iterator).iterations(3).tokenizerFactory(t).trainWordVectors(true).build();paragraphVectors.fit(); treo: and@raver119Any suggestion ? 
solution: 

issue: do you have any idea about my problem? 
solution: 

issue: rawhazard: are you getting issues with 3.9/master? or still with 3.8? 
solution: 

issue: renanlalier: that might be one of the bugs that were fixed on current master causing this so i'd suggest to check at current master, and if you have problems there - immediately let me know, so i can check what's up there i'm afraid that dl4j 3.9-SNAPSHOT will be enough, but to make that work you'll need to have nd4j built from sources, and that requires some efforts :( 
solution: 

issue: Do you guys have any examples setting up layers for the 3.9-SNAPSHOT ? The example still uses 3.8 and it seems like a lot of stuffs got deprecated 
solution: That doesn't help us much ;/. 

issue: Hi all, I am trying to install cli for deeplearning4j on OS X (El Capitan), however, after running the brew command I get a SHA256 mismatch error. Does any one have any suggestion on where to start fixing the problem? Thanks 
solution: 

issue: how can I save the values of the error function, accuracy and score during the training? is there any utility that allow me to do that? 
solution: you can implement your own iteration listener to get the score if you want... accuracy etc can be obtained from the Evaluation object, and you can do whatever you want with that. 

issue: AlexDBlack: im trying to install libn4j to use the gpu backend but im getting the same error as [<-LINK->] , how did you guys solve this? *cpu 
solution: 

issue: does it make sense that the training of my nn (1 hidden layer, 5 hidden units, regression problem, l2 regularization) on a 10^5 dataset, with minibatch sizes=1, takes 10 mins per epochs? (4 dimensional input, 1 dimensional output) 
solution: Accuracy:  1Precision: 1Recall:    1F1 Score:  1. 

issue: Really simple observation (will post as issue if desired):The HistogramIterationListener constructors ignore the specified iterations and uses 1 instead. If my understanding is correct, this prevents a useful smoothing of the graph when  the batches are small and the data is noisy. 
solution: yeah feel free to post an issue. 

issue: is that 3.8 or current master? as i see, current master honors  passed in argument 
solution: 

issue: Architecting an in-house solution for DL4J training. I'm getting ready to acquire some servers that I'm going to use to train via Apache Spark. My question is... If I scale horizontally (the more servers added), is the efficiency of training going to be linear or logarithmic? Or in other words, is network chatter across nodes going to hamper the effectiveness of training as I add more nodes? Are there other problems in the mix? 
solution: 

issue: I'm getting an IllegalArgumentException regarding the layers when I call init() on this model. What am I doing wrong? [<-LINK->] agibsonccc:  [<-LINK->] My code is above, did I do that inadvertently? I tried to borrow as much from the examples as possible Sure agibsonccc: Done I can't provide you with the dataset but its similar in structure to LFW agibsonccc: I just debugged it and it looks like in layer 4 the first element in the shape array is -3760 and the second is 120

solution: 

issue: i post my questionno [<-LINK->] tomorrow ,but i do not have answer, who can help me ok, my question is why i train the data always get the same result 
solution: 

issue: abner2015: actually upload a bit of you test data, when you created the issue, you didn't wait for it to finish uploading If you actually click on it you will see that it leads you to the issue, because as long as it says "Uploading..." it is not finished uploading.

solution: 

issue: kasooja: not sure yet hopefully the next few weeks 
solution: If you want the release to go faster to get your hands on it join this: [<-LINK->]. as well as cuda. 

issue: you guys do anomaly  detection and log analysis right? so you dont see this as a threat bcvaluableenterprise data does not go to the cloud 
solution: 

issue: i’m yet to see publicly available general solution for any (literally: any, not even related to ml) really serious task... for some, yet unknown, reason there’s always some requirements in any task, that force you to get 100500 coders, and start doing something that fits all your needs and in ml situation is way worse :) at least that’s what my personal life experience says :) 
solution: 

issue: i think the real problems is shortage of skilled ppl with analytical tools who can understand such complex none-linear dynamical systems.. 
solution: 

issue: I'm using feature masking, so it stands to reason that my feature mask should be of shape: examples x timeSteps, aka minibatchSize x timeSteps.  Correct? 
solution: 

issue: opencl support is a long way off, unfortunately. so you can't use it for now(fwiw we don't mention opencl as being supported anywhere, on any of the websites) 
solution: no support for AMD GPUs right now, and no workaroundwe'll get to it eventually, but we're focused more on what our corporate customers need... which is cuda. 

issue: hi, can i use the jcublas to run the example code? 
solution: 

issue: so start here: [<-LINK->] there's some details on architecture etc there (how to add new layers) it's still not super easy to do, so feel free to ask questions here

issue: Hi there, I am learning deeplearning4j and trying to write my first test program.   I have put just one simple jpg picture in labeledPath and plan to fit the Convolutional Networks. However, I got an exception "IllegalArgumentException: Shapes do not match: x.shape=[1, 10], y.shape=[1, 3]".  Since I am very new to image recognition, I can barely solve this thorny problem by myself. Is there any kind soul can help here? Here\'s my gist: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: And how i can use a categorical variable in my model 
solution: File an issue on canova, we can add some stuff for that. for now use featureutil. Use categorical expansion (eg: 1 of k classes) [<-LINK->].

solution: 

issue: hello, I put my exception and the whole run class here. this is my new gist: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: I am so grateful for your help! That's it, that's the reason. My test program can be running without an error now. I will be debugging it step by step and dive in this model. 
solution: If you have any particular gotchas (eg: common cases like this) we'd be happy to add more validation wherever possible. 

issue: Hi I am started to look into D4J Installed BLAS, etc Is it normal that LenetMnistExample uses only one core? 
solution: that's more then normal. thats how it should be. 

issue: There are any way the evaluate the model using cross-validation or this funcionalaty are  not implemented yet? 
solution: 

issue: atollFP: if you are going to work on domain specific languages, you might also be interested in the STEPS project from the vpri [<-LINK->] The idea there is to use dsls to build a comprehend-able system from the ground up with a lines of code budget of just 20k lines, they don't focus much at performance beyond good enough, but there are some very interesting things in there if i recall correctly there are also some talks by alan kay about it on youtube, but I can't find them right now :D 
solution: 

issue: the same data train DBN ,but have some  result is   Accuracy:  0.75Precision: 0.75Recall:    0.5F1 Score:  0.6 and somt time result is Accuracy:  1Precision: 1Recall:    1F1 Score:  1 what is different tuninghelp and here ? 
solution: 

issue: theoretical perspective: neural networks are universal function approximators, and RNNs are Turing complete. Though that doesn't mean much in practice.ensembles won't magically allow you to solve a problem that can't be solved using a NN, but they might improve performance (accuracy, etc) a bit vs. using a single net well, some things are just really hard to predict in general 
solution: 

issue: hi everyone :) I want to use deeplearning4j to recognize image in Android Studio IDE, is that possible? Anybody have tried that before? I can't find example code for Android Studio Project and don't know where to start. Thanks

issue: Hi everyone I'm running a NN with this configuration [<-LINK->] and collecting the output in this way:INDArray networkPredictions = net.output(jsIn, false);System.out.println(networkPredictions.getDouble(0,0)); but my IDE gives the following error:Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Indexes, shape, and stride must be the same length I can't get what's the problem the error is on the getDouble() instruction can anyone help me? thanks in advance 
solution: 

issue: hm, I'm going to pull the LSTM part out of that. it was something that someone contributed... doesn't make sense to use a LSTM for that example :/ anyway, apart from that: you can't use that getDouble method on RNN activations RNN activation have 3 dimensions, so you need 3 indexes  [<-LINK->] there's no time component rnns = for sequences I mean it'll work, but in that case, it's effectively a really inefficient MLP 
solution: 

issue: anyone of you want to train his own neural network on my data maybe? =) so this is very weird to me why can't I train the network on this problem? it's just that I fear that this problem is unsolvable with the algorithm in dl4j do you think this is a chance? what I meant btw, is that there is no way that my problem can be solved with dl4j 
solution: 

issue: is there any spark prebuild version ( [<-LINK->] ) where dl4j-3.8 is compatible to?  spark-1.6.1-bin-hadoop2.6 seems not to work

solution: 

issue: alright, so I don't need to import the nd4j.linalg.io.ClassPath and instead import it from Canova? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: thanks for that info! yes our spark cluster will be on a private network, home-grown, so we're turning off all the firewalls for everyone else here... Just wondering if anyone here has a good recommendation for a GPU card that will work well with DL4J that will fit inside a 1u server? agibsonccc: awesome thank you for that I'll fire off a message in 30 :)

issue: perrohunter: that\'s standard java memory management... google "java xms xmx" jstahl4: no, it's one file at a time with image record reader (or minibatches of images via RecordReaderDataSetIterator) jstahl4: I'll need more to go on... post your setup in a gist, and full stack trace (if you are getting an exception) PenguinBuddha: what operating system? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: I got it to work; but I am now experiencing the same issue as@ChrisHayduk I'm re-running the convolution example right now to verify as well 
solution: It occurred for me on the Stacked Autoencoder Example as well. 

issue: Is there an example or tutorial that splits data set to Train and Test sets and does minibatching? Iris example does SplitTestAndTrain but runs the whole data set through at once. My confusion is that once I run SplitTestAndTrain on a DataSet, do I then need to convert the resulting DataSets back to iterators to do batching? 
solution: 

issue: Hello - has someone a good proposal for a NN setup/topology for an OCR scenario to recognise printed letters. Would the MNIST example be a good starting point? I wondered if it would be beneficial to create a own NN for each letter (e.g. 40x40 input --> 1 output) instead of one NN that can recognize all letters? I thought of a CNN though some OCR examples use RBMs ... Someone here experienced with a similar requirement and can share the experience? Actually I already have nicely cut out characters from a previous opencv based step. thanks for the links! 
solution: 

issue: However, on the issue we just discussed BLAS libs can not be related right? Its probably due to the double[] conversion. 
solution: 

issue: Hi all! Someone knows if it is possible to train a Stacked Autoencoder in a completely unsupervised way? I want to work with unlabeled data but themodel.fit()function needs data associated with a label. 
solution: 

issue: Hi I've got a FF net with 400 input, 50 hidden and 2 output neurons to do binary classification but when calling INDArray predicted = model.output(features, false); I always get a shape(50,2) array back so it seems the number of hidden neurons is reflected here and not the number of output neurons, did I get smth. wrong here? 
solution: 

issue: Hey all, Finally I succeed to run an example.  I am running LenetMnist example, and I felt like it is slower compare to other tools (caffe, otrch, etc..). Is there any benchmark on that? It just finished one epoch and took several minutes 
solution: at current master all magic happens in native code, with omp/cuda/whatever. 

issue: Anyone has experienced : WARNING: Failed to load implementation from: com.github.fommil.netlib.NativeSystemBLAS and WARNING: COULD NOT LOAD NATIVE SYSTEM BLAS i get same warnings : WARNING: Failed to load implementation from: com.github.fommil.netlib.NativeSystemBLASWARNING: COULD NOT LOAD NATIVE SYSTEM BLASND4J performance WILL be reducedPlease install native BLAS library such as OpenBLAS or IntelMKL what is rc3.8 and 3.9 by the way? also is there any way to check if the code utilizes my gpu Cool. I need to wait a bit more then. Thanks a lot Adam i see. I suppose i have rc.3.8 how can i switch to 3.9? ok i think i can wait a bit more then i will definitely do that

solution: 

issue: Then I'll ask it to you atm instead of quickly testing it:Is it correct that if I simply use Jackson to transform my object to JSON, that the serializer will be able to rebuild the SequenceVectors with my own SequenceElements? :) 
solution: theoretically yes. but don't forget - things still may change. and don't forget there's base64 used internally.

issue: when running in a spark cluster, who does these "[Stage 0:>                                                          (0 + 4) / 4]" outputs? they are always messing the linebreaks? is it from dl4j or spark? 
solution: 

issue: AkshitaT: You will have to featurize/vectorize your text data as you see suitable. Take a closer look at the different layers in the mnist example. The first few layers are of type autoencoder and the last layer is a softmax layer with 10 outputs for the 10 digits. This is where the supervised bit comes in.

solution: 

issue: I was able to figure out that the issue I was having running the iris example over spark in yarn-cluster mode is probably in the following section from  SparkDl4jMultilayer.java (from version 0.4rc3.8) [<-CODE->] Details are here: [<-ISSUE->] I'm not sure how to resolve the issue though. Does anyone have any ideas? 
solution: 

issue: regarding exporting a trained neural net: is there a possibility to print all the weights and biases etc. of the layers? would that be the easiest solution to implement the trained net in another language? (need to port to android) 
solution: MK-42: one method you could use to get parameters, on a per-layer and per param type basis: MultiLayerNetwork.paramTable(). 

issue: Sorry to ask this again: But if I have used Spark Word2Vec in order to train a model I get  a.gz.parquetfile. I don't think I can read that file and use Deeplearning4j with it, right? I know dl4j would accept binary model files, but how do they have to look like? Because I am thinking about just converting the parquet file into the correct binary format as a last step 
solution: 

issue: Railer: can you please move ANYTHING related to rc3.9 to the earlyadopters channel? jmvanel: that's the default run mode atm yes jmvanel: I'm not sure what you were trying to do but just git clone the examples Your checksum issues aren't even reproducible (no one on the dev team has even ran in to this) Follow our getting started Right now - there we are working on a transition with our c++ lib See: [<-LINK->] That's why I'm not advising to build from source right now DL4j takes a lot to setup The license kinda says apache? You can't just dive in like that the project to setup from source requires 3 other dependent projects As well as multiple build systems and toolchains (cuda,gcc,..) the setup.sh has part of the solution there but we need to finish cleaning that up right now (eg: adding libnd4j)

solution: 

issue: Hi, I want to build a CNN for working with object recognition in images. How can I use DL4J for it? I want to work with Java. Is that recommended? 
solution: dl4j is a library for custom neural nets not "Do my canned thing out of the box" typestuff. ameyxd: if you decide you want to learn DL I can point you in the right direction, but this isn\'t one of those "drop it in in 5 minutes" type stuff. 

issue: so i would train the net on only normal data and when classifying i would compare the net output with the real time series. if high error occurs it is possibily a anomaly?

issue: Are there helper classes for getting an x amount of data from a SequenceIterator to generate a test set or just write it quickly myself? 
solution: 

issue: krayush07: in general just so you know dividing 0.0/0.0 results in NaN, and dividing any other double by 0.0 results in Infinity. I don't knowwherethat'd be happening, but that is something I've found

issue: Hey, I was wondering if there's a way to download just the jar files if we're not using maven and are only interested in running on CPU.   Thanks! 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I realize ND4J doesnt support serialization as of now. How can I save the vectors generated as a text/csv file? I was suggested to use getRows, but the method again returns INDArray, and I am not sure how can I write that to a file.

issue: atollFP: one reason for score > 0 (even with perfect predictions) is l1 or l2 regularization 
solution: 

issue: awesome - thanks! also, can I assume that most production usages of DL4J usually persist "everything" (model, config, etc.) to DBs? In that event, can I assume that DL4J provides an API for doing so? Or is the onus on the implementer to figure out there own way of persisting model+conf (if they choose to not useModelSerializer)? their^ own way 
solution: 

issue: 3) Do we plan to release snapshots for rc3.9? As I understand they are still broken and should be built from sources. 
solution: 3) soon.. 

issue: it filters NaN from the weights Or better said, it toggles the filter... But I have found that if you run into the NaN issue (usually manifests itself as NaN in scores), that you should probably try to use Doubles first, because the filter is quite slow (in comparison to just using doubles) 
solution: 

issue: Vijaychanderrao: anything is "possible" just like any of the other frameworks it sounds like you want something you can just modify quickly Def not there for that You'd be building a lot of these things yourself Since you're new to DL, I'd recco going python 
solution: 

issue: Vijaychanderrao: sure, you can compare DBNs and convolutional nets (though, there's a reasons why everyone uses CNNs and not DBNs for image recognition)

issue: when it is scheduled? 
solution: 

issue: With SequenceVectors you can easily loop over the words in your Vocab. I don't find a similar approach for Deepwalk. Am I missing something? In general, I find Deepwalk really different from the SequenceVectors altough it is basically the same after the fit() method is called. This makes it hard to work with. It seems to me that internally, Deepwalk is just SequenceVectors. But it still only returns a GraphLookupTable. 
solution: 

issue: raver119: Could you point me in the right direction to retrieve the knn labels of the GraphLookupTable for each 'word' in the lookupTable? With SequenceVectors, you can loop over the vocab And for each of the words, you can retrieve the knn other words using SequenceVectors And their labels Deepwalk also provides the nearestVertices() But I don't find a way to loop over the words in the vocab of Deepwalk And on how to retrieve the label for this. It differs a lot from SequenceVectors which I find strange as they are basically the same.

solution: 

issue: I can't find anything in the word2vec source code that shows me how it learns when adaGrad is false is it just SGD? or backprop 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: I have lurked here quite a while. I can do Java but I am completely new to deep learning. The link Skymind sent out today re: Like2Vec actually opened my eyes.

issue: I'm running MultiLayerNetwork and keep seeing o.d.o.l.ScoreIterationListener - Score at iteration 0 is NaN for all iterations. What could cause that? I have not negative numbers in my training date (I do have 0 values) 
solution: 

issue: guys any one seen this ? [<-CODE->] though I do not have any momentum decay It was definitely not happening yesterday, so I suppose some changes made are causing this?

issue: Is there anyone around who has had a chance to look at this issue: [<-ISSUE->] Or is there somewhere else I should post that to get more visibility? 
solution: 

issue: Should I be using a different version of IntelliJ for the 'getting started' document?  There seems to be quite a bit of handholding to get to the file menu.  I'm an emacs/visual studio guy--depending on platform--so I'm not real familiar with IntelliJ. 
solution: that's all up to you. all you really need is java + maven support. 

issue: agibsonccc: I'm looking to hook my model up to aHistogramIterationListenerso I can visualize it in the browser. can i get away with justdeeplearning4j-uior do I need the-parentproject? ahhh, is HistogramIterationListener only available as of rc9? that might explain why i can't find it 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] what about for real production usage? that is, i've trained & tested the model, now I'm using it for realsies? 
solution: Milanvdm: for deepwalk? [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] probably an exception on the getRow op. 

issue: include backend? you should have at least one in pom.xml for rc3.8 that's nd4j-x86 
solution: intellij didn't update it. 

issue: What's the nicest way to return a INDarray as 2d float array ? data.asFloat return a 1d array Hmm I guess I should slice it by indarray.width just to be sure the output of a NN is not flattened right ? If I have N input and the NN has M output, It will feedforward an NxQ INDarray at the end ? 
solution: 

issue: I think thecurrentlearning rate was meant to be plotted here, right? [<-LINK->]

issue: hi all anyone working on ubuntu or linux distro ? with optimus card on the rig ? I am having trouble installing deeplearning4j on my laptop anyone please help ! 
solution: but the thing i wanted to say i'm failing to configure my laptop to support my optimus card , I had conversation with mainline devs but they aren't responding . So, I thought in the meanwhile I should target machine learning communities , as they must be using nvidia cards .. 

issue: j  org.nd4j.linalg.api.ndarray.BaseNDArray.getDouble(I)D+68j  org.deeplearning4j.models.sequencevectors.sequence.SequenceElement.getGradient(ID)D+42 that one is just a coincidence I guess I can't reproduce that .. 
solution: you know, you're getting some weird things with memory there. 

issue: okay.. well I just checked simply if all vectors have the same size [<-CODE->] which appears to be the case.. so no matter what numbers are actually getting loaded here.. the vectors seem to be okay Oh .. I guess [<-CODE->] is actually ensuring that already 
solution: 

issue: Small question, when I get this as error for model output: Column of left array 338 != rows of right 64 or rows of left array 16 != columns of right 64 I get that the input is not of the dimension he expected But I'm not sure how to understand the error message exactly

issue: Hii.... As a part of my course work, I am trying to run DBN and Convolutional  Nets against MNSIT dataset and CIFAR10 dataset(or any other dataset)  for image recognition. Can someone suggest me if it is feasible with deeplearning4j ?    THANKS !! Thanks@AlexDBlack!! 
solution: 

issue: Are there any papers which can teach me how can I improve the accuracy of image recognition? My training rate is always below 30%. No,  do you have any paper for that ? 
solution: i don’t know if there’s a paper that goes into “tricks for improving image classification performance” but those are all the ones that are commonly used to this day. 

issue: is anyone help me? my feed forward nn training error is never reduced.. 
solution: 

issue: manuel-hegner: conceptually: I think you should be able to throw this at a clustering algorithm... can't use cosine similarity as that's not a distance metric, but angular similarity could work. Not 100% sure if that's the best (or only) approach thoughwe do have a clustering implementation in dl4j, but we don't have angular similarity... 
solution: 

issue: This page links to 'DataSetIterator.java', but the link is broken - does anyone have the correct link? [<-LINK->] 
solution: we'll get that link fixed. 

issue: sfokeas: ,@treois right, I believe you will need to implement theDataSetIteratorinterface and perhaps even theRecordReaderinterface, depending on your use case other folks here can correct me (i'm new myself) but I believe at the end of the day you just want to convert your data into a collection ofDataSetinstances Canova is a subproject that helps do this for commons data formats (CVS, etc.) but also defines interfaces that you can implement yourself  that will produceDataSetsthat you then feed into your models but i don't see any reason why you couldn't just do this translation yourself, outside of the Canova API 
solution: 

issue: hello, can i have a link to feel an issue? thanks@eraly 
solution: 

issue: treo: from the past question i did the dataset.. must be transform from our network to work?

Anything i am missing? 
solution: 

issue: sry, but i remember only one issue about that...@AlexDBlackprobably can check that out when he comes online 
solution: In the meantime I'll investigate a bit more about the vertex degrees.. check dl4j issues history, there was issue regarding that. 

issue: would using the 0.4-rc3.9-SNAPSHOT work or do I need to download the latest source? 
solution: dl from source atm. That involves some c++ you might want to do that yet. unless you'd like to help us test ;). always willing to help. I will try to compile this mamma then.. 

issue: Hello everyone I am looking for an advice is it possible to use a CNN for a regression problem with DL4j? 
solution: You can take any of the examples and just change it to not use softmax. Well again, this is more of a basic neural net question. 

issue: For Deepwalk: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: Cannot generate code: code length exceeds 64 bitsat org.deeplearning4j.graph.models.deepwalk.GraphHuffman.traverse(GraphHuffman.java:73)@Milanvdm 2 options there: either too many elements in graph, or too many vertices with 0 degreeI have 31382 vertices and 72621 edges. And it gives that errorI only have 809 vertices with degree 0@AlexDBlack AlexDBlack: 
solution: removing them probably isn't the end of the world, as you can't learn anything useful for those vectors anyway. 

issue: hi where can I get  IRIS Classifed With a DBN code? 
solution: 

issue: deepwalk uses a random walk on the graph... no outgoing edges (or, no edges at all in an indirected graph) means it's not possible to conduct a random walk from that vertex 
solution: there probably is something we can do there, like skipping those vertices during the random walks perhaps. 

issue: hey guys, Im really new to this whole NN thing.. trying to figure out a simple example.. I want to feed my NN a sequence with a couple ints in it, like (1,1,1), (2,2,2), etc. and have it predict the next one -- in this case (3,3,3).. I can not for the life of me figure out what type of NN I should even be looking at.. can someone point me in the right direction? 
solution: 

issue: hi all, I see rc3.8 depends on Akka 2.10:2.3.4.  IthoughtI heard rumors that the Akka dependency would be disappearing in rc3.9, is that true?!? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: I removed most of the deprecated classes in dl4j-nlp using Akka, so I think akka deps might transit until the POM is cleaned up (in master) 
solution: 

issue: MinhwanYu: as@AlexDBlacksaid earlier - do not try to use CUDA before rc3.9 gets released on may 16th agibsonccc: said the same thing actually np just wait few more days we're working on cuda performance these days 
solution: 

issue: @agibsonccc  + @raver119 : yesterday we quickly discussed dl4j's akka dependencies. it sounds like the akka dependency will be removed from dl4j-core soonish, but that other modules (like dl4j-nlp, dl4j-spark, etc.) will continue to depend on akkawhen that time comes, aside from a pull request, is there any reason why DL4J couldn't upgrade to a more recent version of akka? [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] thoughts? hate mail? 
solution: hotmeatballsoup: dl4j-nlp WON'T depend on akka, because i personally had rewrote everything in dl4j-nlp, to make sure akka is NOT used there anymore :). 

issue: i'm afraid that module with akka in name, is supposed to be related to akka somehow, and probably might even use it so i'm not sure about that one that definitely goes up to@agibsonccc

issue: Hi, I have an image classification problem. I need to create a training set for 2 or 3 diferent objects for example a ball, a banana and an orange. How can I create the data set? The features of that data set will be all pixels value of each diferent image? Sorry, I need some direction points please. Do you know what I've to download to work with DL4J? But I don't see any example about how to do a new data set or how to use images to create that data set. Yes I've that example running here but with iris data set. I don't know if I'm wrong or not but I thing to recognize some objects I've to create that data set right? Well, I am trying Sorry man, I'm just starting and I've some questions.

issue: Hello! I need help setting up DL4J and ND4J. I'm puzzled by BLAS (implementations/libraries). Exactly. I'm using Gentoo. Either it has no adequate support for BLAS or I'm not getting it right. Aha... OK. I tried installing blas-reference (it's netlib's BLAS). OpenBLAS installs only /usr/lib64/libopenblas_threads_haswellp-r0.2.15.so Should I make simlinks to that? 
solution: 

issue: So, you have cloned the examples repo, and can run the examples, but it tells you that it can't find a native blas lib? take a look here: [<-LINK->] It is just that netlib-java which is used in rc3.8 has a peculiar dependency on them being named right given that you use Gentoo, you should probably just emerge openblas or mkl and make sure the symlinks are set correctly (as shown in the page I just linked) intels mkl usually is faster (as long as you are using an intel processor), but, at least on windows and with mkl 11.3, it is a bit of a hack job to force netlib-java to work with it 
solution: 

issue: yes I use double[][] because I generate those double[][] inside the code 
solution: And we'll see if we can make an inmemory record reader or something. 

issue: yes, writing minibatch code yourself is very error prone .... wasted a lot of time on it :D 
solution: 

issue: guys I still am not sure how to do the preprocessing that I need with INDAarray methods well I'm not sure what I will need to do on my input right now that's why I would like to be able to use all the matrix operations that INDarray delivers like mean, max, mean, divi, subi, etc yes my problem is I write to file my double [][] and then load it as DataSet with canova when can I use the INDArray operations? I have no NDArrays in these steps 
solution: 

issue: no idea. got a full stack trace? 
solution: 

issue: yeah, but nothing looks out of the ordinary there, and the silly part is I dont see what could cause the mismatch in the number of input columns simply by changing the number of epochs... Sounds wicked to me, even if I say it out loud... well I am now running a full train, and have put in a shit load of logs and asserts in the test part, lets see what breaks, ill make a gist of it, once Its done, probably a few hours

issue: I have been trying to run the LeNetMnist example  with 3.9 snapshot. I get the error [<-LINK->] I have configured  Open BLAS and it works fine for 3.8, but when I try to run it for 3.9. i get the following error. I am running it iff of master branch. I get the following error. [<-LINK->] thanks !! 
solution: 

issue: Vijaychanderrao: You can't use snapshot right now unless you build from source Vijaychanderrao: There's zero room for misinterpretation of what I said You literally can't use rc3.9 till you compile from source If you'd like to attempt it move in this channel: [<-LINK->]

issue: thisIsNiceName: -make sure the maven dependencies are pointing to the correct version. I had issues with setting up examples in Netbeans, but realized that the examples use a previous version of the dependencies. (I had the newest imported, and it didn't work. After correcting my Pom, it worked right away) 
solution: 

issue: Maven has some of that XML stigma still attached to it, but honestly, it is pretty great after the 5 minutes it takes you to understand it: [<-LINK->] it has everything the JavaScript community is reinventing every 5 minutes directly baked in... ... that just gave me an idea: DL4J maven template for starting your own projects? 
solution: 

issue: ok i manage to make it work, thank for your help earlier :) 
solution: 

issue: hey, I have a question, i started reading the tutorial on the website the iris one ( [<-LINK->] ) but when they give the full code i don't understand, where and how they get the data set ? the dataSet is suppose to be loadind in the DataSetIterator right ? 
solution: There is a class for Iris data set. IrisRecordReader or something.... DataSetIterator iter = new MnistDataSetIterator(batchSize,numSamples,true);. with batchSize = 1000 and  numSample = MnistDataFetcher.NUM_EXAMPLES. 

issue: Data set is contained in the examples (I guess). Or it is downloaded from the Net when you start the app. 
solution: 

issue: i am sorry but there is another  error like :Exception in thread "main" java.io.EOFException: Unexpected end of ZLIB input stream when it run thought     DataSetIterator mnistTrain = new MnistDataSetIterator(batchSize,true,12345);

issue: Hey everyone, so right now I am trying to load in images. I have 18 classes and 60 images for each class, so 1080 images in total. How is it possible for me to associate each class label with each batch of 60 images? I've been trying to split them into different folders, but it seems like recordReader isn't able to access  the images within each folder Oh cool I didn't see your previous message But yeah that's my exact problem 
solution: Now I put all images in just one folder and create a csv file with this format: id,label. id its the name of the image (1.png) and label frog for example.. 

issue: This what I'm using, and it isn't working. I've followed the image data pipeline guide pretty closely, but it doesn't seem like ImageRecordReader isn't actually getting the images: <script src="https://gist.github.com/ChrisHayduk/90063e636d9831e2532b10f861bce169.js"></script>  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Cris I've to go away for 2 or 3 hours, can you send me an e-mail todanielsantosvieiramail@gmail.com? I contact you and we work togetter I never open an issue on github, I have to see how to do that before we start ;) 
solution: Just create a new issue attempting to communicate what problems you were having with the custom image pipelines. ChrisHayduk: can add his project later or we can merge the issues. 

issue: agibsonccc: @WikiDreamsSorry about that guys, I just stepped out to grab lunch. I'll set up the issue now agibsonccc: @WikiDreamsI just posted the issue. It's [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: WikiDreams: I think there are one of two issues with the ImageRecordReader. Either it is unable to access the subfolders which contain the images and needs all of the images to be in a single folder, or it is not assigning the class labels to any of the images I'm not getting a shape error, but my net only predicts one class when I set the ImageRecordReader to use the main folder And I am testing on my training set (just to work out bugs), so it should be 100% 
solution: 

issue: Hi everybody! I don't if this is the right room, but i'm a totally beginner. I'm starting from absolute zero. If this is not the right room please indicate me the right one. Thanks a lot! 
solution: 

issue: Maybe I'm missing in API but to use the NDArrayIndex, you can get 'slices' of the NDArray via NDArray.get(NDArrayIndex.all(), NDArrayIndex.interval(x,y,z)) etc, but even if you reverse the columns in this case, from y,x, there is no way I can see to do an equivalent of numpy's slice [:. ::-1] etc. Just curious - will implement myself unless I'm missing something - thoughts? 
solution: so I started hacking on the NDArrayIndex and there's a way if you play with the interval methods to do it. 

issue: if my label is real numbers not  just int , how should i to built my dataset? yes ie     1.234,  4455,   4344 ,    4.566,     1.444 the last num is the label 
solution: 

issue: JohnDreamer: are you importing data from something like csv? 
solution: 

issue: how to scale my data to the  range(0 to 1) 
solution: one approach is to use a DataSetPreProcessor. basically you define a DataSetPreProcessor, then you can call setPreProcessor on the RecordReaderDataSetIterator. if a row of my data like this 1.234,  4455,   4344 ,    4.566,     1.444the last num is the label,  i should use RegressionEvaluation(4)?. 

issue: I would like to know if I can have an explanation of number of parameters for a multi-layer configuration? in any way? That will help me to understand better. I mean the way of EXPLAIN command to print explanation of query plans in relational databases? :D ok thanks, I will try numParams :)

solution: 

issue: @/allScala devs please DM me or file an issue. We are releasing on the 16th and I'd love to understand the problems you've been facing. I'll be doing a basic pass on the spark/scala versions to get those up to date with current standards JohnDreamer: that's mainly for getting ints out output() is the more standard way of doing it which gives you the probabilities .output() is usable for both uhh what? Wait hold on So what do you think output does? Let me walk you through that a bit When you want to predict You want to predict an output You can't do that without input 
solution: In supervised learning you have your data and your labels. 

issue: can i use model.predict() to get the prediction of my data with the trained net? should i use it like model.output(test.getLabels()) 
solution: 

issue: Hello All! Question: If I have data with temperature outside, temperature inside and invoice from electricity company, to put this very simple, and I would like train a model where I could find some dependencies when my invoice is getting higher .. what would be the choice of neural net ..

issue: chrisdonlan87: there's a lot of work being done on wave forms... in industry, google and baidu have publiished quite a bit. are you try to apply DNNs to acoustics? [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] elederlus: got it. thank you. we'll take a look at this... 
solution: 

issue: rcorbish: no reason to "verify it" if it runs in intellij you're done Try the LenetMnistExample if you want to see something running If it makes you feel any better you can open an issue and we can probably come up with something for this. Imports can't fail like in python if that's what you're after the compiler is supposed to "verify" for you on a cluster I could understand this I guess? 
solution: 

issue: elederlus: that error means your labels are wrong. your net is expecting a [minibatch x 2] labels, but is getting [minibatch x 100] labels check that you labels array contains only two elements: with current image record reader it expects images to be in /class0/someImage.jpg, /class1/someOtherImage.jpg, and the labels array should contain {"class0", "class1"} 
solution: 

issue: yeah, bad splits could be causing large jumps. fwiw we're currently working on that with our new image record reader that's because your network is crazy large... 30000x60000 in just one layer: that's 1.8 billion weights in that layer alone tl;dr you're over the Integer.MAX_VALUE limit for number of parameters (and, activations too probably) in one network in next release that isn't an issue, but you probably don't want to do that anyway because it'll take too long to learn buffer length < 0 is integer overflow, fyi 
solution: 

issue: i customized that for my data(256 * 256).if not ,what number could i chose for that? 
solution: elvisfqx: cnns are typically used for that scale of image. I'd stick to 28 x 28. 

issue: javaman42_twitter: there's some basic MLP classification and regression examples there with plotting... they are in the classification and regression directories here: [<-LINK->] good place to start 
solution: I followed a link in the doc but "choose a neural net" .... 

issue: Hello guys, I've some questions here. I train 2 classes each one with 5000 images. After model created I test with the same data, the output was this: Examples labeled as 0 classified by model as 1: 5000 timesExamples labeled as 1 classified by model as 1: 5000 timesWarning: class 0 was never predicted by the model.

solution: so this must use GPU when available ? no ?. 

issue: Is there a JavaDoc page for SplitTrainAndTest? I need to tell it to select every nth instance ideally as currently it is just taking the first n instance (I think!) agibsonccc: is it random by default? I have 1800 instance, 270 of 'class 1' and none of these are selected for the learning process when using  a 0.67 split

solution: 

issue: that looks pretty much like it doesn't have scala on the classpath still looks like it can't find Scala 
solution: i assume by 'it' you mean spark?. 

issue: aocy: I guarantee any and all compiler errors you're getting are because maven isn't setup right Are you trying to coreate from scratch My best advice: [<-LINK->] Copy the pom.xml from here as a starting point we never suggest users start from scratch because of how much complexity there is to manage we could definitely make it easier, but this gives you a starting point for things like imports and the like 
solution: 

issue: is there an easy way to see if OpenBLAS is actually being used in my spark job? Ithinkgot it installed right 
solution: japhar81: basically if you don't get that BLAS warning when running a spark executor. yeah it was scrolling too fast, i do still get it. I added a config for them to /etc/ld.so.conf.d. 

issue: "lone the examples and just run those first"  what does that mean ? (sorry..my english is not good)@agibsonccc 
solution: other example can run sucessfuully. 

issue: Could anyone help me on my code ? For the neuralnetwork configuration Something else, i find the answer for this 
solution: When i try to create the neuralnetwork, eclipse either said i don't have enough memory, or and array out of bound when i loop though the iter with iter.next(). 

issue:  [<-LINK->] it seems that the problem is occurred in  "net.init();" (line 90) “o.d.o.l.ScoreIterationListener - Score at iteration 0 is 217.13977385497094o.d.o.l.ScoreIterationListener - Score at iteration 0 is NaNo.d.o.l.ScoreIterationListener - Score at iteration 0 is NaN” fine@agibsonccc 
solution: 

issue: treo: i actually did that.. unless I actuallyhaveto create /opt/OpenBLAS because the path is hardcoded? 
solution: you are right@agibsonccc. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] so.. there it is. And yet, its not happy..  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: japhar81: download a netlib-java jar, unpack it, and ldd the native.so for your system, that should tell you if it finds everything or not

issue: is 3.9 when the new CUDA stuff will be there? I'd much rather go GPU, but I was told not to even bother till that was out.. and.. that did it! rebuild = works 
solution: 

issue: I am trying to implement an RNN using my own corpus created from word2vec and I can't seem to find how to the size of the word vectors for the input into the first layer. Is it the same value as I put in for layerSize when I created my word2vec?

solution: 

issue: raver119: thanks for your quick reply on my issue [<-ISSUE->] i'm not quite sure what i should do now 
solution: so you might wait till 16th of may. mlaubre: if you're going to be using this please move to earlyadopters. or just build things manually. 

issue: looks pretty much like you tried to update to rc3.9 without doing anything to actually make it work everything depends on your problem size and hardware here 
solution: 

issue: nd4j-x86 isn't valid backend name for rc3.9 
solution: 

issue: hey guys may I ask a question? what do you mean when you say that dl4j is not made for research? 
solution: the focus of our efforts is on commercial uses, not researchresearchers and companies have different needs around deployment, features, etc. however the ecosystem (dl4j, nd4j, canova etc) is architected to be more suitable for production, separation of concerns; interperability and maintainability etc. 

issue: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -14476266    at org.nd4j.linalg.util.FeatureUtil.toOutcomeVector(FeatureUtil.java:38)    at org.deeplearning4j.datasets.canova.RecordReaderDataSetIterator.getDataSet(RecordReaderDataSetIterator.java:207)    at org.deeplearning4j.datasets.canova.RecordReaderDataSetIterator.next(RecordReaderDataSetIterator.java:150)    at org.deeplearning4j.datasets.canova.RecordReaderDataSetIterator.next(RecordReaderDataSetIterator.java:288)    at org.deeplearning4j.datasets.canova.RecordReaderDataSetIterator.next(RecordReaderDataSetIterator.java:42)Does anyone ever got that kind of error ? 2 classes ( 2 kind of pictures) I'm pretty sure it's because of the nIn and nOut value of each layers What i really don't get, even with the MNist tutorial, is how you determine the nIn and nOut, don't it depend of the stride and kernel size ? ConvolutionLayerSetup ? Don't we use ConvolutionLayer.Builder() ? 
solution: 

issue: log.info("Train model");while (dataSetIterator.hasNext()) {cifarDataSet = dataSetIterator.next();splitTestAndTrain = cifarDataSet.splitTestAndTrain(PERCENTTRAIN);trainingData = splitTestAndTrain.getTrain();model.fit(trainingData);} [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: yes, System.out.println(cifarDataSet.getLabelNames().size()); get 0. So never add labels no no, isn't a cifar dataset iterator. Its just a DataSetIterator dataSetIterator = new RecordReaderDataSetIterator(imageReader, BATCHSIZE, -1, LABELS.size()); you are using colored images? 
solution: for a 32 X 32 colored imaged will be  1024 X 3. elvisfqx: that's it and the output its equals of numbers of classes.. 

issue: Trying to follow the macosx cpu only libdn4j install guide.

Path variables for libnd4j set, xcode installed, mvn etc all works fine. 
solution: 

issue: I've downloaded the BLAS libraries and I've set the path according to: [<-LINK->] but when I run the DL4j examples I got the warning that BLAS is not installed.  How can I activate BLAS ? if you train the network for a specific problem the DL4J will save the net parameters to work with them later ? 
solution: enache2004: you have to save them yourself see [<-LINK->]. 

issue: treo: thanks! will take a peek in a min 
solution: I explicitly mean things that can be solved exactly and that someone thought out as a problem to be solved with NNs. treo: yeah, okay. That applies in this case, and you're right. If you can do it faster and simpler with other tools then you're right. 

issue: lots of docs here: [<-LINK->] I usually suggest starting with the following:http://cs231n.github.io/\nhttp://www.deeplearningbook.org/\nhttp://deeplearning4j.org/deeplearningpapers.html\nhttp://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/\nhttps://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets not knowing java (I assume you don't) will make things more difficult for you 
solution: 

issue: as of next release it\'ll print "at iteration X" where X is the number of parameter updates as for the score itself: that's the value of the loss function on the last minibatch so mean squared error, negative log likelihood etc whatever you have set in your output layer 
solution: 

issue: tmsimont: it's normal only if you're using old enough calculator for that... in all other cases it should work faster my questions were pretty simple: you have DataSetIterator. Then you get batch from it in cycle, and applying splitter to batch i don't understand what you want to achieve with that 
solution: well I get 1250 images, and separate them in train and test datasets. 80% for training and the rest for test. 

issue: I need to reshape all the matrices in a dataset does it make sense to do it in this way: while (iterator.hasNext()){iterator.next().setFeatures(iterator.next().getFeatureMatrix().reshape(1,25,195));} ? 
solution: 

issue: I'm working on text generation; word by word instead of character by character. I'm struggling with building vectors for input/output. I'm using 4 words per sequence (3 as input and one as output). I'm not sure if this is the right way.Is this correct? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: Also, i have a quick question. Once more it\'s about downloading the source for Eclipse. With " downloading source and javadoc " from the Maven option, i got the source of Canova and ND4J, but no the one of DeepLearning4j, is there a .jar avaiable with thoses sources ? 
solution: So if there is a jar with the source, i could download it and link it to eclipse. 

issue: Hi colleagues, Do you have another doc how to test my models output then [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: I use Intellij and Maven is not shown in the list of the imported project. how to fix that ? 
solution: synonym for "not, that\'s definitely wrong, and it shouldn\'t take that much under any circumstances". I use the steps included in dl4j tutorial. 

issue: raver119: sorry what do you mean by old enough calculator (regarding slow lookup times for WordsNearest() )? i'm running a pretty vanilla script... tried both the rc3.8 and the master branch in github pretty much just load the GoogleNews-vector-negative300 bin... that takes a while (obviously) and then call WordsNearest() on the model for a single string it takes 10 to 20 minutes 
solution: 

issue: tmsimont: what hardware do you have? and which java version? java 1.7 may be one of the problems already, the other one may be that you don't give your jvm enough memory the jvm isn't as greedy as other platforms, you have to allow it to eat up all your memory first :) it can choke, and still run... slowly, while the gc makes just enough room to continue it is a linux box, I guess? cat /proc/cpuinfo will tell you the cpu and free -m should tell you the ram 
solution: 

issue: java 1.7 sdk -- looking up hardware specs... one of our lab computers with some serious power, can't remember the specs on the one i used off the top of my head wouldn't the heap just get exhausted? i tried this on other machines and if i didn't give enough memory it just chokes or are there memory checks written into dl4j? ok i don't think i did pass in that Xmx arg on this box yet i'll try it out and see if it speeds up unfortunately our lab site with specs on the box is down weka weak* 
solution: 

issue: But in that case, and with the constructor you gave me, i can't speciafy how many samples i want to train my model with And in that case my constructor look like new RecordReaderDataSetIterator( recordReader, 10, numRows * numColumns +1, labels.size()); Even with what you give me, i still have the same ArrayOutOfBoundException

issue: AlexDBlack: Are biased also initalized by WeightInit ? Because I thought of a simple way to have an ouput identity layer. Just a normal output layer with an initialisation with 1 as weights and 0 as biases and 0 learning rate Wouldn't that be easy to add with the right weightInit ? 
solution: you can't do it directly using weight init, you'd have to set the layer parameter manually to identity matrix. 

issue: wait, I should do .slice(0).slice(0) to get the 2D matrix or? why the .slice(num)? I just want to get the whole 2D array, not a specific row 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: @agibsonccc [<-ISSUE->] I didn't test but I think this should work to add identity layer

issue: can someone answer me a question? how it will be the iterator for a csv file with just image pixels information (no labeled)? this is to read if the last column it is the id class DataSetIterator testIterator = new RecordReaderDataSetIterator(testRecordReader, batchSize, labelIndex, numClasses); how can be if the last column does not exists? I already put numClasses = 0 but do not works "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unable to evaluate. Outcome matrices not same length". What is the trick? 
solution: 

issue: is this .getRow(i).data().asDouble() the correct way to get the i-th row of a ndarray as a double[] ? 
solution: 

issue: Hmm I wonder why ParseNet doesn’t work as well for SOV languages like German and Japanese I would love a dl4j version of that. 
solution: 

issue: hi guys, we are planning to use dl4j on spark, is there any samples  AutoEncoder by taking a lot of data from hdfs as input? 
solution: 

issue: Good morning guys, can someone help me here? I've to work with 2 data sets, they have the same format except the second does not have the last parameter (label). When I try to evaluate the model says something like can't be evaluate because the matrix don't have the same length. Someone can give me a direction? treo: makes sense. So what I have to do to create a classifier with my model and use it for example in real time detection? Something like test that classifier with images taken from a smartphone? well, the question is for everyone.

issue: Hi All,I am facing 2 different issues while compiling deeplearning4j projectOutofmemory for compilation, i set it to #export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=1024m", then it worked. This issue was for "dl4j-spark-ml" component.\nstyle/StyleChart.java:[30,24] package java.time.format does not exist, it see this package is not in JAVA 7. available in Java8.Please let me know if anyone has same issue and solution 
solution: 

issue: mhotrx: can you open an issue with a simple example that reproduces that?you shouldn't have any issues with getRow on a 1x50 the magnitude of the scores you expect depends on things like output normalization and the loss function you are using thisIsNiceName: more generally, low scores are good thing is, you need to actually look at the mathematical form of the loss function to know what to expect but that\'s exactly what I\'m saying. you are calling 1 "super low" not realizing that it\'s totally expected for some loss functions and situations, like mcxent/negative log likelihood

issue: Hi,it is my first day around, I have some trouble to extending CharModellingExample. I would like to predict next character based on previous one and feature vector for reviews (to have different distribution of characters based on review characteristics).I changedinput.putScalar(new int[]{i,currCharIdx,c}, 1.0);in data method which returns DataSet for next iteration toINDArray vector = Nd4j.zeros(4);//current charactervector.putScalar(0, currCharIdx);//first featurevector.putScalar(1, 1);//second featurevector.putScalar(2, 0);//third featurevector.putScalar(3, 1);input.put(new INDArrayIndex[]{NDArrayIndex.point(i), NDArrayIndex.all(), NDArrayIndex.point(c)}, vector);It seems to be working. However, I am not sure if it is correct... THX for every help I have. Is it offtopic? 
solution: 

issue: I did. TXH for explaining to me. I figured out that I can extend input vector with vector of my features at the end so I would have different representation for characters from different reviews. However this is limited to binary features only... If you have any ideas, they are most welcome!

issue: Hi, I'm trying to build a CNN for a RGB image where all three channels should be used.Can you tell me how the DateSet has to be structured, so it is a valid input for the CNN.If I try to add the channels as rows in the feature INDArray I get an IllegalStateException because my image array has length 3 and my label only length 1 agibsonccc: if im understanding this correctly the channels will be linearized to row vector? 
solution: 

issue: a-frank: right, buffer ends up like [channel 0 values][channel 1 values][channel 2 values] reshaping occurs in the net basically better, faster, more powerful image loading coming soon :)

issue: anyone happen to have a GPU sample for the upcoming 3.9 bits? Thinking about playing with the SNAPSHOT build agibsonccc: i'm happy to build it, I'm just not quite clear on whether i should still use jcublas or if it's just automatically in there or what 
solution: 

issue: not really. sigmoids aren't really used anymore due to vanishing gradient and saturation, but even there bias init of 1.0 will just make those problems worsethere is an argument that ReLU might perform better with a small positive bias init to avoid the 'dying relu' problem, but leaky relu solves that without the bias initonly place that I'm aware of where bias init of 1.0 is best practice is forget gates in a LSTM recurrent neural net

issue: I found that the module dl4j-spark-ml in the master branch was removed yestoday. Is that a permanent operation? Does it mean the dl4j won't support spark ml any longer? 
solution: I would be interested in a spark.ml wrapper around the spark impl we already have in java. 

issue: not at present, as far as I know. open an issue on github though, and we can maybe looking at adding that 
solution: I want it to integrate well with the newer apis but we need to do a proper pass on it as a standalone scala project. 

issue: I am trying to run dl4j-0.4-examples on GPU, but get the error: "java.lang.RuntimeException: org.nd4j.linalg.factory.Nd4jBackend$NoAvailableBackendException", who can help to solve this problem? I replaced nd4j-x86 to nd4j-jcublas-7.0 in pom.xml, because my cuda version is 7.0 OK

issue: AlexDBlack: the issue [<-ISSUE->] shows that it is already done ...? or is that just a discussion 
solution: 

issue: Sorry, this might be a really stupid question - I can't see on the ND4J installation page how you actually install ND4J... 
solution: AlexDBlack: I would love to try it .... if so: use thatIf not: learn maven and use it :P. in all seriousness, it's the easiest way. also plenty out there on google. 

issue: When I run idea64, and click Help -> About, it says JRE: 1.8... amd64. But when I run a dl4j sample, the first line comes up: [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: robinchesterman: that’s old piece of documentation. since rc3.8 it doesnt matters, because everything gets wrapped properly internally robinchesterman: it would be nice of you, if you file an issue describing where you’ve got that on our site 
solution: 

issue: Is this page missing code samples? [<-LINK->] 
solution: check dl4j examples. it’s all there. 

issue: what is "score at iteration 0 is NaN"? can be overtraining? 
solution: 

issue: Any news on the new release today? Want to throw it on a cluster :D if anyone has a benchmark then: i could let it run on our university's gpu-cluster :D 
solution: 

issue: i think it's just guys who can help with that are busy with release preparation. there's a lot of work involved with that yes actually it will just with the same settings 
solution: 

issue: if I'm reading the chat log correctly, it looks like 3.9 will be out within 24hrs and that this includes GPU (Cuda) support via the new ND4J release? If so, will you all be making a release message on the webpage along with some notes on the changes? great, thanks for the confirmation :) 
solution: 

issue: Hi there, trying to run a DBN auto-enconder and getting some errors, i'm pretty sure im not setting this up right is anyone able to help?  [<-LINK->] raver119: i played around witht the iris and mnist "tutorials" but its my first try and editing any of this though so i apologise in advance if its anything "stupid" can you just walk me through a bit on the DataSetIterator? i parsed all my info into a csv file with 2k+ something lines i was trying to adapt the dbn auto enconder but im getting the dataset info from a dataset from a csv* i used the sample on the site using the CSVRecordReader 
solution: 

issue: normalization is almost always a good idea, but i have to defer to the engineers on this one:@nyghtowl?@alexdblack? jfyi, we're putting out a release today, so they may not respond until tomorrow... 
solution: Yes, yes no problem. I ask tomorrow ;). 

issue: What would be the best way of retrieving the data from a output layer? 
solution: 

issue: Another question, I used the predict method in a DataSet object that contains only a image. The output of this method is an int [] is not supposed I've only one result (the label predicted by the model)? 
solution: 

issue: nyghtowl: that's pretty terse, not sure how understandable that is when read out by a screen reader 
solution: 

issue: and what's the idea? you basically want to shuffle at the end of epoch or before it but IN cycle not outside of it 
solution: also: overfitting potentially. and if batch size of 1k works, why not just use that??. because we said that the normalization method on DataSet only works correctly if all the data is in the same DataSet. 

issue: I can make code to shuffle the information at the csv file creation. Is better right? and then this code while (trainIterator.hasNext()) {DataSet train = trainIterator.next();for (int i=0; i<nEpochs; i++) {model.fit(train);}} yrs? yes? 
solution: epoch is a roll over full dataset iterator. roll over single batch is called iteration. 

issue: agibsonccc: retraining the model is very computationally expensive. <unk> is an option but does it really solve the problem? So my idea was using regression instead to update word2vec incrementally and update the LSTM with the new value each time the model needs to learn a new word. Why? A word that hasn't been seen before. Think a new name or a verb in a dialect that was never handed to word2vec during training. 
solution: Think a keyboard app and you typed "I will meet Mohsen tomorrow". Mohsen is a new word. Adding this sentence to word2vec will train the model to know mohsen then incrementally train the LSTM model to predict this sequence. 

issue: i still don't understand why you would need w2v for that task it's not like you're going to get 100gb of hand-written words it's character-level on 1st problem and binary vocab on 2nd 
solution: 

issue: I'm sorry Adam, would you share any reference to approximating a word vector ? That would be great I remembered edit distance now, levenshtein refreshed my memory. 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: so i store all the DataSet into a big <List>, then loop through this list, put each element in the StandardScarlar's transform() method, then evaluate them ? 
solution: 

issue: I want to train a MLP with LFW dataset using the code : [<-LINK->] and I get java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.nd4j.linalg.util.ArrayUtil.toNDArray([I)Lorg/nd4j/linalg/api/ndarray/INDArray; last time I've compiled myself the nd4j libn4j to use BLAS yeah..the method that process image as vector is not there 
solution: 

issue: to use it in dl4j example I need to update  dl4j and nd4j to 0.4-rc3.9 ? 
solution: 

issue: that seems to be all you need.. im building my sample-based code now 
solution: 

issue: but can the examples even work if nd4j rc3.9 isn't out yet? 
solution: 

issue: yep, pulled examples and running it right now (i.e., worked perfectly first try for me) 
solution: 

issue: japhar81: that's just a data normalization issue. empirically (and, mathematically) nets learn better with values in the range -1 to +1, or N(0,1) distribution gradients and activations can explode (or become unstable) otherwise; or with regularization you can't get weights big enough it's just regression, right? 
solution: 

issue: well, I've take a look at the iter object and the file paths are there but I can't see any other raw data like numbers (RGB values or something like that ) 
solution: 

issue: the full 10 epochs of the lenetmnist example took 14 minutes with cuda on my machine (gtx 970) 
solution: JohnTheDang: yes, you also need 2 lines with cpu, that is because you are using sbt. 

issue: and what do I need to do for cuda? Is including nd4j-cuda-7.5 instead of nd4j-native not enough? 
solution: 

issue: After training the auto encoder and using the model.predict with the samples used for training, all i get is mostly 0\'s.  This means my network is "fucked up" right?Sample of the input: 49,0,1954,0,56,35,1954,0,47,42,1954,0,35,42,1954,0,56,0,2113..I\'ve been bashing my head nonstop at this, could use some help =( 
solution: 

issue: ok, so i thought I'd take a swipe at openCL am I right that I should be working on libnd4j? and if so.. why the heck won't it build on a mac? 
solution: japhar81: you don't need to build libnd4j to use it, not anymore. 

issue: opencl shares the same block mechanics like cuda, so porting current cuda code shouldn't be an issue 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: I'm currently trying out the new 3.9 version. I noticed that my cpu usage went down from 100% (v3.8) to just 35% (v3.9). Are there some env vars to configure for using all cpu cores? And how can I use the new version with MKL? 
solution: 

issue: enache2004: LFW has some issues and needs work. Most up to date progress is in [<-LINK->] If you want to help it is always welcome otherwise better to wait till we can circle back to it WikiDreams: dealing with release and other items today but DM me the code.

issue: ok guys, can you tell me where I define ndArrays in my code? I only use simple methods like I saw on the examples 
solution: 

issue: well I've already read the documentation and add this for my Nd4j.dtype = DataBuffer.Type.DOUBLE;NDArrayFactory factory = Nd4j.factory();factory.setDType(DataBuffer.Type.DOUBLE); How I can view that? I already saw the pom file but does not have the version. 
solution: yah, and I define it to be doubles. In fact I know the data in my csv file is formated as double, what I do not know is ndArrays are define to float. Now I've a WARNING: Failed to load implementation from: com.github.fommil.netlib.NativeSystemBLAS.

issue: the new version of nd4j is <nd4j.version>0.4-rc3.9-SNAPSHOT</nd4j.version> or without -snapshot any more? for canova for dl4j and nd4j too? so for all! 
solution: 

issue: Hello everyone, there are examples of regress. I have seen the dl4j-0.4-examples 
solution: 

issue: so using an iterator is the same as using a batch method on the whole dataSet ? 
solution: So i end up with that from what you told me. yes. 

issue: agibsonccc: I had earlier spoken to@AlexDBlackabout customlossfunction. He created this issue on github [<-ISSUE->] I am quiet comfortable with c++ .. I would like some pointers to get started.. 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: I sent you a DM, in regards to Skymind 
solution: I replied to you already. 

issue: I am trying to find whether this is a library for image processing? 
solution: however, it includes architectures suitable for images. since i am running on CPU, it's taking forever... looks like its suitable for GPU systems. 

issue: if I use CSV Record Reader, the whole training set is not loaded in memory, is it? only minibatches are loaded in memory, right? 
solution: I mean, that is important because I might have very large training set.

But I don't want to packege all in one jar. 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: well, since i'm developing my experiment code, It's quite ofen that I need to rsync local packge to remote, so all-in-one jar is quite big to transfer. agibsonccc: Adding empty systemp property java.library.path does not help. 
solution: 

issue: could you open an issue on this? if you can share your data set, that would help too (or, send it to me privately via email) cuda backend is new, so it could well be an issue with that 
solution: 

issue: Good morning, I have two questions about the CNN examples: What is the diference between using model.fit between a cycle of epochs and between a while with iterator.hasNext()? something is wrong, because if I can run the mnist train I have to run my own too with that network. Ok, could not be the best model configuration for this case but have to run. So I am trying to read the my csv file like they do on iris example and then start my my problem with NAN values. Probably the only problem here is about my csv file... I do not understand yet

solution: 

issue: raver119: where exactly do i have to put the folder with the compiled jars of nd4j? or do i have to play around with a PATH-var? I changed the nd4j-version in the pom of the examples to 0.4-rc3.10-SNAPSHOT, but now i just get "The POM for org.nd4j:nd4j-native:jar:0.4-rc3.10-SNAPSHOT is missing". I guess i have to specify somewhere where the nd4j-stuff lies? 
solution: 

issue: Anyone can help me about my weird error ? What is weird is that the error does not always happen you can see my code here : [<-LINK->] i have either super high value then NaN, or the error Iterated to [0, 0, 0, 0] out of shape for indexes [2, 30, 47, 47] and final eps shape [2, 30, 47, 47] sometime the value change

issue: Hi, I am trying to move to 3.9, but it seems that packages dl4j-spark-ml and dl4j-jcublas-* have not yet been released to maven. They do exist in sonatype as 3.9-SNAPSHOT though. Are they gone for real or they just have not been built yet? got it, what about dl4j-spark-ml? 
solution: 

issue: where can i find documention on what .nIn and .nOut from e.g. a convolutoinallayer mean? it seems clear that these are the number of input and output neurons of the layer as in some easy examples, but e.g. for the face recognition i dont see what .nIn nChannels should mean ah so .nOut in a convolutional layer is the number of feature maps .. so filters are somehow genereated automatically? thought one would chose them by hand like straight lines etc. and what about the "no jnind4j in java.library.path" error? :) treo: isnt that setting -Djava.library.path=""? 
solution: 

issue: @OliverScheel make sure to set the java.library.path to empty in your run time configuration propertieshaven't heared form you since that depends on how you've done it and if that didn't fix the problem, gist the full error log OliverScheel: then gist the full error log OliverScheel: vm arguments is the correct place. Does it work with the examples? and that is your problem rc3.9 only supports 64 Bit JVMs 
solution: 

issue: OliverScheel: what are you doing with a 32 bit jvm in 2016? o_0 
solution: yeah i just have a 32 bit os :/. yeah .... 

issue: Ah, gotcha. Any idea if the new release will run on RHEL 6.7? 
solution: All right, thanks.. 

issue: Trying to run the spark examples with 0.4-rc3.9 but it can't find nd4j-x86 0.4-rc3.9. Issue posted here [<-ISSUE->] Is that a quick fix? 
solution: yes: use nd4j-native instead of nd4j-x86. 

issue: Hm, ok, that fixes the first issue, but the CNN example throws an error. After deleting that example it builds fine, but I need to provide an updated version of glibc. I'm on 2.12 and it seems to depend on 2.14. 
solution: 

issue: Iam facing EOFException while running my first deep learning example..please suggest some guide lines 
solution: 

issue: Hi, have the issue of running dl4j on gpu been solved yet? I.e. the errorjava.lang.IllegalStateException: Can't allocate [DEVICE] reduction buffer memory! 
solution: 

issue: is there any docs on how to compile it from source? my error stack is here [<-LINK->] 
solution: but if you haven't been in the earlyadopters channel it's not worth the time right now. we'll be publishing another release within a week or so. 

issue: Hi I get this error when loading saved network parameters:: No enum constant org.nd4j.linalg.api.buffer.DataBuffer.AllocationMode. I think I am saving and loading correctly, using the same instructions you provide here: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: and shows the correct iteration always showing 0 was a bug 
solution: 

issue: i'm not sure what we might do with ML in 32-bit environment every other task involves >4gb ram here well, hypothetically you might be able to compile for 32bit manually not too much changes would be involved i think but i personally hadn't tried that 
solution: 

issue: where can I find the code for jnind4j.dll? 
solution: If you want to give compiling from source a shot you'll need to go to [<-LINK->]. if you know cmake I'd take a pull request that did 32 bit. For a simple job, I will try to upgrade the JVM to 64. 

issue: Hey  [<-CODE->] The layer 4 is a fully-connected to layer 5 right ? 
solution: right. 

issue: so I am trying to access the DataSet inside my DataSetIterator the first one with .next() get the error here: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid indices: cannot get [0,4860] from a [1, 4860] NDArray I can not understand why the problem is exactly on that 4860 I have 4875 features and 15 output where does that 4860 come from? well...it is exactly 15 positions before the last feature...are you sure everything is fine with that RecordReader? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: sadatanwer: If it has a GeForce or a Radeon GPU that you're not using, disabling it can help a lot with that 
solution: 

issue: can you load it all in the memory? you can do the normalization by yourself, not difficult but a bit tricky...probably you should just use the StandardScaler 
solution: but when I make model.fit(train) inside a cycle of epochs I get memory problems. 

issue: WikiDreams: so your problem is not in the fitting, it is in loading the data in the memory when normalizing, right? 
solution: if I make model.fit(allMyData) I've got memory problems. 

issue: a bit busy now. still at work :) i better wait for the release i'm glad I've found smth useful 
solution: 

issue: ok yeah this isn’t using GPU, and I dont see any docs for 3.9 :-/ whats the magic trick to turn it on? raver119: you mean instead on nd4j-native? 
solution: however you should know, that current nd4j cuda build contains few bugs, which will be fixed in upcoming release at weekend. 

issue: millisecond: have a read through this first, that might answer your question: [<-LINK->] if not, drop back here to clarify 
solution: 

issue: @/allflagging the Udacity/Didi prediction contest. DL4J doesn't have a horse in the race yet... ;) [<-LINK->] postdocs to study DL and RL: [<-LINK->] new nd4j javadoc is here: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Are there any papers about padding and masking, I can't seem to find a decent one. 
solution: 

issue: raver119: How do I do that ? I have added [-Djava.library.path=""] to JVM options under Run>Edit configs, it didn\'t work. Is that what you\'re referring to? 
solution: adverley: fixed that. i_modibbo_twitter: post a gist of the full error please. 

issue: nice. got any ideas to pull the rc3.9 from mvncentral? The thing is, my IDE is not showing any import errors, it just doesn't pull the dependency when refreshing my dependencies with gradle. It probably has something to do with following quote from the nd4j doc: 'Certain build tools such as Gradle and SBT cannot resolve transitive dependencies for specific platforms.' and since i can run the [<-LINK->] i believe my path etc is OK@treo,@Habitats treo: , thanks for the quick answers though! Habitats: , mind posting your gradle build file? 
solution: you use dl4j rc3.10 which is not yet on mvn central so i guess you have some local builds which solves some gradle build stuff. 

issue: hi friends i m new in  gitter can anyone tell me what is the current topic of issue being discuss here 
solution: i don't have much knowledge about , so it is great chance for learning more to me. 

issue: i get following error: no jnind4j in java.library.path, where do i get jnind4j  from? solved =) 
solution: 

issue: treo: and@Habitats,  i couldn't pull the dl4j core and native nd4j because my gradle build file contained maven url to my own artifactory. I deleted those lines and it works now :) thanks for your help! 
solution: 

issue: Hi, every one. Can anybody run into this problem? When i run dl4j-examples on CentOS 6.7, i got an error: Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /tmp/javacpp648402155820908/libjnind4j.so: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.14' not found (required by /tmp/javacpp648402155820908/libjnind4j.so) My GLIBC version is 2.12 So what can I do? 
solution: 

issue: it’s impossible. if you have only cuda backend in pom.xml, there’s no way to get it not to work :) it just has no idea about cpu use :) i mean it’s something i really want to see at some point, but we’re not there yet lol 
solution: 

issue: guys I think I detected some problem here... when I run the same code twice I've got diferent values.... the first time the last score = NAN... the second time score = 89.....? 
solution: i hope you dont expect a probabilistic algorithm to return the same result every time. 

issue: I do not understand why... seems like some variables are shared? I make new instances.... do not understand 
solution: 

issue: DevinCalado: seems like you're having an issue with line breaks on windows vs unix. you can usedos2unix(available through cygwin) to fix stuff like this 
solution: 

issue: Hi everybody, Im trying to use my GPU cuda 7.5 but seem that is not working<artifactId>nd4j-cuda-7.5</artifactId> but when i see the watch nvidia-smi , nothing changes I dont see Java process or something that DL4J is using it? 
solution: 

issue: What if I really what to modify the data, e.g. apply min/max filter? What's the best way to implement this? maybe InputPreProcessor? 
solution: 

issue: I needs some help  [<-LINK->] It crashes , and I can't fix it 
solution: 

issue: PeterTaylor01: unfortunatelly, there was few minor bottlenecks in nd4j that were affecting nlp however most important bottleneck there (shapeInfo creation for views) is already eradicated, and improvement already merged to master so current master should work way faster for w2v and it’s derivatives but probably that’s not the end of changes there for w2v, probably need minor polishing pass, to match latest changes done for nd4j-native just in master agibsonccc: there’s my branch checked alredy, it contains all fixes + speed improvements ready for cuda. but i’m travelling atm 
solution: 

issue: so what I understand was, at this moment nothing works to cifar and waht I've to do is my own iterator based on ImageRecorder and then fill it in a generic iterator right? 
solution: 

issue: Luux: are you using 3.9? 
solution: rumor has it theres some GPU bugs that will be fixed in a release this weekend. might be your problem. 

issue: Luux: Or are you using 3.9 with dropout? There are some  heavy performance issues with dropout for me. 
solution: mjakobus: I don't even know what dropout means ;). 

issue: Hey everyone, sorry if this isn't the right place to ask, but i've been searching high and low for an example and can't seem to find anything. I was wanting to know if anyone knew once you've trained your NN, what are the common ways of actually using it in an application? Like how would you save / deploy your NN, and then pass in data to be classified? Really sorry if I am just so dense that I didn't see that in the tutorials, but i've been reading the past few days and this is the only thing I really couldn't find anything on. 
solution: 

issue: i dont know how this works in dl4j, but since this is all just matrices, you just save them and pass in new data that needs to be classified 
solution: 

issue: I'm also receiving same message as@Luux(Please note, CudaEnvironment is already initialized. Configuration changes won't have effect). I have single GPU (GeForce GT 740M). I'm quite impressed with CUDA speed up. Thanks guys! Looking forward to it! 
solution: 

issue: raver119: 1) i mean the Net calculate the backwards weight adaption depending on the error calulation from the output of the net, right so far? and i need to define a error function like -> Sum square or Absolute Error 
solution: 

issue: now it’s me who can’t understand question. if you’re asking how to use existing ones it’s a loss functions i guess. if you’re asking about custom loss functions - they’re in todo list mostly. something is available for that, but not all required 
solution: 

issue: Im getting an odd error message,UnsatisfiedLinkError C:...\\jnind4j.dll: Can't find dependent libraries I've added the os classifier as well agibsonccc: just to confirm should I set:-Djava.library.path=""or -Djava.library.path="<location of DLL>" 
solution: 

issue: Hello! I'm having a bit of trouble setting up a neural net using one of your examples and I was hoping I could get a hand understanding an error message I\'ve altered MLPClassifierLinear.java and now I\'m getting "Layer not named l1 or l2 has been added to configuration but useRegularization is set to false." I have the same number of hidden layers as the example, although with a different data set and a different number of input and output layers *nodes, not layers Anyone have a tip? 
solution: 

issue: Window-7 Professional,java - 1.7Maven -3.3.9please check this [<-LINK->] I have set the java.library.path="" , and could not figureout why it is stillthrowing the Error "java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no jnind4j in java.library.path" run>>edit configurations..>>EnvironmentVariables java.library.path="" I have done this in IntellJ ide 
solution: 

issue: Hi bingyupiaoyao,  did you update java.library. path="" in VMOptions?? Sorry Adam..I am reading it completely.. Actually I am trying all possible options with out reading it fully ..this time 
solution: 

issue: I am trying to solve the "no jnind4j in java.library.path" error mentioned above.  I am using Eclipse and Windows 7. I have added -Djava.library.path="" to the vm arguments in the run configuration, but am still getting the same error. I am missing something? above comment at@agibsonccc 
solution: When you run the class, could you try a :. 

issue: Andy-P: You're on Windows x64 and using Maven 3? 
solution: 

issue: GZX-ZJU: we need to work on the printing stuff (limiting the number of characters etc) again for this release yet file an issue on [<-LINK->] and we can look in to it a bit more andreas-eberle: we haven't compiled libnd4j for arm yet nothing stopping us I suppose saudet: thoughts on this? He's done a lot on android with javacpp we haven't looked at it yet though 
solution: 

issue: hello guys, some dl4j developer? I need to ask a question for the responsable of recordreaders etc it is easy ;) 
solution: 

issue: Is there an example of using mini batches somewhere? I'm currently trying to create a predictive model for classifying  9 features  (some continous, but all normalized to [0,1]) into 2 classes. I have 2 million records available for supervised training.  I've split the dataset into batches, and fed each of those batches into model.fit (batches.get (i)) in a for loop. ... I feel like I'm doing something a bit wrong. Any tips on batching? 
solution: wel, on ImageRecordReader class the method initialize is not working properly. The images are not been labeled I suppose. I look to the method and is a condition that will never happens because there is an variable it will always null. And what I've to ask if it is suppose to be like that.... 

issue: Maybe its like my error? I debugged it a bit more and found out, although labels in the previous function is correctly initialized, I get an error in the lines   public DataSet(INDArray features, INDArray labels, INDArray featuresMask, INDArray labelsMask) {if (features.size(0) != labels.size(0)) saying that labels is null 
solution: 

issue: OliverScheel: you are getting problems here right? while (iter.hasNext()) {DataSet data = iter.next();} 
solution: 

issue: skiwi2: isn’t “gradle is a waste of time” just a standard axiom in the java world? its never worked well for me 
solution: 

issue: Hey again, I've got two questions about neural networks 1) Does it make sense to classify multiple independent output classes with a single neural network? 
solution: 

issue: Getting an array of doubles out of an INDArray is really hard.  Is there a reason for that? For a row vector: (0 until a.shape()(1)).map(a.getDouble(_)).toArray 
solution: It's actually relative to nd4j.backend in the properties. 

issue: I find <artifactId>nd4j-cuda-7.5</artifactId> in the pom.xml of rc3.9 examples.  Does it mean that it use GPU as default? After I edited nd4j.backend and run, it told me  o.n.j.c.CudaEnvironment - Please note, CudaEnvironment is already initialized. Configuration changes won't have effect 
solution: allocaiton rules, caching rules, parallelism rules - everything that’s might affect cuda experienc can be tweaked. 

issue: then you should start with checking that your data is correctly loaded 
solution: 

issue: Hi , gays ,  i want to do a regression on the iris_shuffled_normalized_csv.txt     like   data ,  for example , the  data is 0.083333333,0.583333333,0.06779661,0.083333333,0.60.416666667,0.291666667,0.491525424,0.458333333,1.7  ,  the label is not  0,1,2 ..  so , which read  function should i choose ,  not the RecordReaderFunction()   ? 
solution: 

issue: hey I am using eclipse....how should I get dl4j into eclipse working? so eclipse is not ok? right? 
solution: 

issue: Hi there, I\'m using rc3.9 on win8_64 (0.4-rc3.9:windows-x86_64) and doing many model.output() calls.Now I have JVM crashes at libopenblas "Unhandled exception at 0x000000003A9333E3 (libopenblas.dll)"after arbitrary number of output predictions (sometimes after 2000, sometimes after 5000).Is this a known issue? treo: seems that when I call System.gc() each ~ 1000 classifications the problem disappears... (just fyi) I somehow don't get an error crash log (these hs_... filse) out (don't ask me why not...) but yes... I'll analyze it tomorrow and file an issue... 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I keep getting this error when I try to use the RecordReaderDataSetIterator  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Once I start my example using eclipse I get the following error:could not scan file org/nd4j/nativeblas/linux-x86_64/libjnind4j.soI'm using the gradle build system well, I get an org.nd4j.linalg.factory.Nd4jBackend$NoAvailableBackendException afterwards  [<-LINK->] my build.gradle treo: you mean line 8 and 10 or 9 and 10? 9 is staying commented right now 
solution: 

issue: org/bytedeco/javacpp/opencv_imgcodecs opencv emulated by javacv... are you using rc3.9? 
solution: JohnTheDang: the only thing I now, is that class is a class of javacv (think that cames from opencv). but I think dl4j with maven gets javac too. 

issue: treo: IntelliJ cant find the dependency if you meant that I should add it to my build.sbt 
solution: 

issue: Hello, If i want to use Canova library for image processing, does it require to have opencv installed in machine ? 
solution: 

issue: it does aFFTso complex numbers are needed for it ... do you know when the API of nd4j will be fully functional again? I'd love to use it more in my projects. 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: actually I wanted to use conv2d in a non-dl4j context, so purend4j. 
solution: 

issue: no, of course not. it's just how we print themprinting full precision becomes completely unmanageable for all but tiny arrays 
solution: 

issue: joachimdb: Hi Joachim - did you solve the "UnsupportedOperationException" problem with the eigenvalues/-vectors? I actually ran into the same problem with a very simple covariance matrix. 
solution: Arvin_Arora_twitter:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: so I'm training a CNN but the training got stuck on some saddle point  or local minimum I tried different updater can not really make it work someone can help? adaptive updaters do not help, I get the best "convergence" performance with momentum 
solution: 

issue: rawhazard: what CNN are you training ? what makes you think that the model could do better ? I mean, the momentum will help you converge faster, so if you see a better performance with momentum, it could be that you didn't run the training with sufficient epochs ? 
solution: 

issue: how can I save my nn iteration score to file? right 
solution: 

issue: guys can I make a newbie question. Training a CNN pass to all the time experiment the best values for the network, acoording to the processed data? for example, 10 classes each one with 100 images probably do not have the same parameters to another 10 class of 100 images each rihgt? or wrong? 
solution: 

issue: treo: ,can we have 32 - bit windows and work on it?? 
solution: 

issue: Does anyone know why I might be getting a NullPointerException on "model.fit(trainIter)"? 
solution: 

issue: wiku: yeah, 3.9 release with CUDA support came out a while ago now, 3.10 (mainly bug fixes) will be out shortly EmilyMazo: impossible to diagnose that without the full stack trace. post the stack trace in a gist (gist.github.com) and paste a link to it here so I just ran MLPClassifierLinear with batchSize=1000, nEpochs=1, .iterations(1000) and I'm seeing exactly 1000 iterations (0 to 999) according to the score iteration listener... rawhazard: open an issue with full details - including hardware, software details, and the contents of the error log (i.e., the hs_err_pid3696.log mentioned in the error) simple solution: retrain your model... 
solution: 

issue: Sometimes during the training of a CNN I get this error:  [<-LINK->] this happens quite frequently hardware and software details are already included in that log I'll upload only that one do I have to provide a runnable source code too? 
solution: 

issue: When will the problem with the image be fixed ? ( don't remember if it's the recordreader or datasetiterator) 
solution: 

issue: How to build nd4j  0.4-rc3.9 for ubuntu from mac.  The following runs correctly in build m/c (mac). But when i copy it in a remote ubuntu, get no jnind4j in java.library.path error.<dependency><groupId>org.nd4j</groupId><artifactId>nd4j-native</artifactId><version>0.4-rc3.9</version></dependency> 
solution: I have a maven project where I added the above dependency & used mvn clean package assembly:single to build the jar. The jar runs correctly on build platform (mac). 

issue: how can I set a decaying learning rate? my optimization algorithm does not converge the error function oscillates do you have any idea what the problem could be? 
solution: 

issue: thisIsNiceName: Did you file an issue detailing the problem you are encountering? 
solution: 

issue: thisIsNiceName: is it about the NullPointerException when using ImageRecordReader together with RecordReaderDataSetIterator? 
solution: Yhea. 

issue: Hi, I've trained a model that recognize 6 different faces. Input dataset was normalized in training process. Evaluation was 96% in the case of Lenet Now when I try to recognize only one example the net is not able to classify it correctly Because initially the normalization was done on the entire dataset , now the net failed to recognize for one image that was also normalized any idea ? 
solution: 

issue: thisIsNiceName: I have found that the error is caused by setting the nbr of pixels when creating the ImageRecordReader if you set it as -1, it should work at least it did for me Nice, that is what Adam wrote right? 
solution: so sad that I can't use rc3.9 yet. 

issue: Hi everybody,  after run the script build-dl4j-stack.sh with -c cuda debug everything runs ok and generates and installs all the jars with the last version 0.4-rc3.10-SNAPSHOT ; what could be an example of a POM with this versions? Amazing Daniel Thanks! 
solution: 

issue: GitLack: the only guy with that issue since 3.9 release got issue solved by reinstalling cuda toolkit you could check that in issues he was recieving the same error code oh, actually@treoalready said the same 
solution: 

issue: sorry if this is documented somewhere, but now that the numerical code is in c++, what can i expect to happen if i build an assembly jar on one platform and copy to another? 
solution: currymj: Just add another dependency with the classifier specified. 

issue: I take a look at the class..is not a good idea when you build the model, the network, to save mean & std inside the json ? and then when I call model.output(testData) to compute normalize my data using the mean,std saved in the model ? I've save it everyone sleep :D 
solution: 

issue: hy, any dl4j developer here? enache2004: so you already get your network working? 
solution: 

issue: my dataset..6 distinct classes with face images 
solution: 

issue: so is class 0, go to the list and get the folder name with index 0 I do not know if I'm understanding what you need 
solution: anyway is not so important because is working. 

issue: enache2004: try to keep confs etc in github gists: [<-LINK->] enache2004: good job! That's what it's intended for 
solution:

solution: 

issue: ng_foo_meng_twitter: Go read actual neural net literature and start actually digging in? You have to frame the problem You can't just run 1 demo from the quick start and expect to solve real problems That means understanding the tradeoffs of multilayer perceptrons vs sequential etc I mean what KIND of classification problem are you trying to solve? sequential? document classification? Go read some actual papers There's no 1 size fits all answer here 
solution: 

issue: and why not the test set? 
solution: you need the normalization for the training. once the training is done you don't need it anymore...you just have to apply the same normalization on the test set. and then aplly that normalization to the test, isn't that?. so like if you normalize with mean=0 and std=1 you want to calculate mean and std over the training set. 

issue: do you have train and test separated or you split when you are training? 
solution: and then when you load your net model, you also load normalization parameters ( mean & std ). 

issue: Do you need to use BufferedImage? Or do you have image data in files? 
solution: I think is something like load a file and returns a NDarray or something like that. 

issue: Hi anyone gave a look at this [<-ISSUE->] ? I see...it's just that I can not complete a training because somehow at some point that error occurs 
solution: 

issue: hello, i have problem with data visualization MultiLayerNetwork Trained_Net = new MultiLayerNetwork(tze_ro_nimo);Trained_Net.init();Trained_Net.setListeners(new HistogramIterationListener(1)); any thoughts?

issue: Hello, I am having  problems making deeplearning4j-nlp:0.4-rc3.9 work with gradle.  I keep getting "Could not find javacpp-presets-Linux-amd64.jar " 
solution: 

issue: What is that code for ? 
solution: 

issue: It's a bit bonkers to be using feedback without having a definition of what it is, really! :) (Actually, I think I worked out what it was last time I was using this. Was it as simple as sum of chosen error function over an epoch?) 
solution: 

issue: well after 5 epochs I get 2. something.. is not good I think so. Anyone can give me a hand and tell me what can be changed? 17:19:16.978 [main] INFO  o.d.o.l.ScoreIterationListener - Score at iteration 94 is 3.216104615581993517:19:47.353 [main] INFO  o.d.o.l.ScoreIterationListener - Score at iteration 95 is 2.965362565915098 my network can't pass from more or less that scores strategys? 
solution: 

issue: can be problems here? log.info("Normalise data...");StandardScaler scaler = new StandardScaler();scaler.fit(iterator.next(params.getNumExamples())); [<-CODE->] raver119: can you see if that code seems well please? 
solution: that depends on what you want to do. code you've posted is supposed to do training in multiple epochs, in batches, and each batch should be scaled uniformely. 

issue: recently google has released SyntaxNet and I installed.  to get it to work better I wanted to know whether using Deeplearning4j  and word2vec help me to turn this part of speach tagging and depandancy relations to some understanable command to a machine? sorry if this question is too simple :) 
solution: WikiDreams: That's perfect for image classification using tensorflow there are some good tutorial in Udacity. 

issue: The details of my computeros: Windows 10jvm: 1.8.0_74I use IntelliJ the run it on my computer,The details of the serveros: Linuxjvm: 1.8.0_91I run it by the following command :"java -cp "target/dependency/*:target/deeplearning4j-examples-0.4-rc0-SNAPSHOT.jar" -Dorg.nd4j.parallel.enabled=false org.deeplearning4j.examples.feedforward.mnist.MLPMnistSingleLayerExample" so what else do you need

solution: yup. 

issue: agibsonccc: can you give a little hand here. I've two questions: first, I am using ImageRecordReader, and bachs, is a problem my data is not shuffled while training? well but using batchs I cn't do that remember when yesterday you said to make something when I've memory problems? something like give more memory? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: assuming that the part of the code is done well, what kind of tests are done to a network? I am using Lenet. After 10 epochs have a score dde .9 to 2215 images (10 classes). The size of batchs influences the score? I have to increase the number of images per batchs? I wanna make something like more or less a debugger for what can be made to tunning the network. Some directions please 
solution: hum but what I am trying if it is possible to do is ok.. this learning rate is not good check this and this l2 value etc. 

issue: why would a nn not be deterministic? 
solution: ye, but its not deterministic whats the problem, its the huge size of parameters and time whats the problem. 

issue: wait, are you sure that@WikiDreamshas saved the transformed data as a new data set? ah, yeah missed the last part 
solution: hum.. I think that data is not been saving with tranformation. but yeah, then you only need to use the saved scaler parameters on new unobserved examples. so to be sure, first time we call fit and tranform and save. then just fit and go, and with new data transform that's it?. 

issue: Has rc3.10 been released yet? 
solution: 

issue: should the pom.xml @ [<-LINK->] be configured to use CUDA and my gpu? 
solution: You aren't going to be able to do much with any java based project without at least being able to modify the pom. 

issue: im not very familiar with maven but the dependency listed there is in my pom file under  the <dependencyManagement> section. I ran an dl4j example and two separate tools show my GPU is at 0% utilization during the entire execution. Is there anything i could be    missing? agibsonccc: that worked for me, thank you for the swift reply 
solution: 

issue: I just want to say thank you for your work Adam! :) I'm looking forward to see your book coming out soon! 
solution: 

issue: Start by reading the docs Great, you have to have some background on it, or youwillwaste a lot of time 
solution: 

issue: can dl4j run on jdk 1.6? 
solution: 

issue: In the tutorial "Customized Data Pipelines for Images etc.", it says "...as long as you make sure to adjust the nIn hyperparameter...". Where (which classes) is the nln hyperparamter? Thanks. AlexDBlack: by every single example, it means every training image or something else? Thank you. AlexDBlack: thanks. I meant nln should equal to height*width. Then if I changed height and width, where should I adjust nln? Sorry, not nln, should be nIn. 
solution: nIn for CNNs is input depth... 1 for monochrome, 3 for color images. Set input dimensions using the ConvolutionLayerSetup thing as per the mnist example. 

issue: OliverScheel: @treoand me are working on cpu SIMD optimizations right at this moment + some gpu stuff is going to be added today hopefully yes, it's fine, and that message already deprecated on master 
solution: 

issue: how to test if cuda it's really used in computation with CudaEnvironment ? Cuda it;s used as backend in pom the only message related to it is: Please note, CudaEnvironment is already initialized. Configuration changes won't have effect I guess is fine 
solution: No one who pays my bills has complained about that. 

issue: if you have only the cuda backend in your pom.xml, then there is nothing else that can be used 
solution: 

issue: hello, i trained a CNN network with 4 layers, with images from two classes.. and i am trying to find the probability matrix for a new image.. 
solution: alekospj: use .output(). Yeah load the trained net with the ModelSerializer. 

issue: when saving the dataset into a file, is there any particular extension to the file ? 
solution: thisIsNiceName: You could?. You name it. 

issue: is it not that increasing the iterations variable to 2 here [<-LINK->] just means doubling the learning rate? 
solution: 

issue: I asked a problem yesterday about opencv exceptions: UnsatisfiedLinkError: no jniopencv_core in java.library.path; UnsatisfiedLinkError: no opencv_imgproc310 in java.library.path. Actually I had the same exceptions when I was using javacv. The way I fixed the problem with javacv is to change Gradle "compile \'org.bytedeco.javacpp-presets:opencv:3.1.0-1.2:windows-x86_64\'" to compile "\'org.bytedeco.javacpp-presets:opencv:3.1.0-1.2:windows-x86_64\'". In other words, I need to specify the classifier in the gradle command. However, how can I fix this problem in dl4j? Anybody can give a hint? Thanks a lot. Sorry, the way I fixed the problem with javacv is to change Gradle "compile \'org.bytedeco.javacpp-presets:opencv:3.1.0-1.2\'" to compile "\'org.bytedeco.javacpp-presets:opencv:3.1.0-1.2:windows-x86_64\'". 
solution: One thing that MAY work for now is specifying it as a dependency in your project. 

issue: I have problem regarding getting nd4j 0.4rc3.9 through sbt 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I am trying to find an information about how to implement some word prediction algorithm in Java. So basically there is a lot of theory in different resources, but no real examples or experiments found. Is it possible to somehow use word2vec or maybe a different way? Some starting point needed. 
solution: 

issue: another silly questioni am trying to use nd4j 0.4-rc3.9 in scalai put this in sbtclasspathTypes += "maven-plugin"libraryDependencies += "org.nd4j" % "nd4j-native" % "0.4-rc3.9" classifier "" classifier "macosx-x86_64"but i got an error say[error] 1 not found[error] [<-LINK->] i tried several things but couldnt\' make it workany way to get it working? agibsonccc: thanks,  i was in traffic just now agibsonccc: i don't need nd4s, just nd4j libraryDependencies += "org.nd4j" % "nd4j-native" % "0.4-rc3.9" classifier "" classifier "macosx-x86_64" 
solution: 

issue:  [<-ISSUE->] , a issue filed. 
solution: 

issue: @agibsonccclook at tensorMmulit's dot product, I want to do cross product, like elementwise I can't reshape [1,2] to [2,2,3] without broadcasting agibsonccc: ok I prepare an example with numpy equivalence and expected results agibsonccc: I have tried the muli(reshape(1,2,1).broadcast(2,2,3)) and it fails, while muli(reshape(2,1,1).broadcast(2,2,3)) works fine, but it not what I want ;) the broadcast works only on the slices of the first dims.... 
solution: 

issue: dou you know if there are a cross validation test for testing the neuronal networks? agibsonccc: yes but the api has a tool for doing cross validation ? 
solution: xuskorea: We'd have to build that. Again file an issue. 

issue: hey guys I have a few problems working on the example on word2vec more specifically on the ParagraphVectorsClassifierExample i built exactly the same folder extructure and i provided in the labeled folder a lot of data(3000 files) when i run it it gives me this problem: uncaught exception illegal argument length must be >=1 at this line INDArray documentAsCentroid = meansBuilder.documentAsVector(document); 
solution: 

issue: Hi @agibsonccc, yeah, so my network is giving me the following output:Examples labeled as 1 classified by model as 0: 44 timesExamples labeled as 1 classified by model as 1: 5956 timesWarning: class 0 has never appeared as a true label. This class was excluded from the average recallWhere, 1  is Spam and 0 is ham. My dataset has 1500 ham and 4500 spam emails. I understand it has tuning issues, but I do not understand why it’s not identifying ham emails at all. 
solution: AkshitaT: it might take a few epochs before the network is trained well enough to classify as 0. 

issue: Hi, I am quite new here. I installed latest packages with maven, also VS2013 and Cuda 7.5 (compiled cuda exmples which work), and when I try to run your exmple, I get this error:Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no nd4j in java.library.path I can't find nd4j.dll anywhere (only jnind4j.dll), so I guess I must be missing something. The example I tried is MLPMnistSingleLayerExample, but it also happens for others. 
solution: 

issue: hello. How do I fix the error "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unable to evaluate. Outcome matrices not same length" I am not sure what this means 
solution: Either way your datasets are mismatched, it could be you calling eval on JUST the input?. 

issue: I can't seem to find any release notes for 0.4r3.9.  Can someone point me in the right direction? Thanks for the quick reply. I was wondering if the cuda stuff is usable now.

solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: a question, when I call model.score() during a training, over which data set is the score calculated? the whole training set? I know that you can call it giving as argument a DataSet, then it is clear how it is calculated I'm trying to figure out from the source code, but I can't 
solution: rawhazard: score() is computed during training. 

issue: so basically it is over the last minibatch, right? 
solution: right. change nd4j-native into nd4j-cuda-7.5. 

issue: how to use gpu instead of the cpu ? if it's not by default is using  [<-CODE->] and Nd4j.dtype = DataBuffer.Type.DOUBLE; the same ?

issue: hello anybody? I got a problem that "no jnind4j in java.library.path" error osx Im running spark example on google dataproc 
solution: 

issue: tonythefreedom: using maven, or gradle? 
solution: You're building the jar locally. 

issue: I have a maven-based web app that is using dl4j-0.4-rc3.9 - works fine on OS X, but gives the following errors when running on linux, Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no nd4j in java.library.path - I have read [<-LINK->] but it seems that it should work on Linux without any changes to POM file. The war file seems to include all the nd4j*.jar files. Is there anything specific that needs to be done with a maven project? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: Just to know if i have to wait a lot or not, do you know when i'll have an answer for the issue ? 
solution: 

issue: tonythefreedom: for what it's worth i never got dl4j to work on dataproc after 3.9, so i just setup my own vm's (on google) and isntalled my own cluster lol you should know because i told you 100 times 
solution: 

issue: how it was impossible to get a working scala 2.10 build ah i already moved away from both google and 2.10 now anyway:P document what exactly how to get it running on google? tonythefreedom: you can build wahtever you like on dataproc, you have root ssh access ... and then you submit jobs with "spark-submit ...." agibsonccc: my problems were 95% scala/3.9-SNAPSHOT related tonythefreedom: seems to be using scala 2.11 for his dataproc thingy though; soudns like trouble, as thre's only 2.10 installed unless they changed in the last two weeks 
solution: 

issue: Does someone know if this is possible to have a HistogramIterationListener for Word2Vec model training please ? (or more basically to log the error rate for each iteration ?) the setListeners allows to attach listeners attached for eachiteration? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: If I'm correct : the idea it is to create a singleton made of one SerializingListener instance which implements VectorsListeners (this one provide the method called at each epoch end). It seems OK to create a listener at each end of an epoch (source seems to implement this). Problem is that I don't see the functionality to fetch the current error for the Word2Vec (extends SequenceVector) instance. I am going to fill an issue unless I only missed how to fetch the error in the API ? 
solution: 

issue: hello guys, can someone give me a hand here? I test some network configurations and the result for activation is tanh (I am working on a CNN using Lenet) What i see people use relu for activation... can be a problem or is no problem if my train do a good job with that configuration according to my data. the same configuration using Activation: tanh gives 0.6 and with relu 0.4... is a problem using Activation: tanh for a CNN classification problem? no one to help? 
solution: 

issue: From my experience relu is mostly used for regression problem at output layer

issue: Ok, one question on RNNs. If I have my DataSet ready for simple feed-forward net, what do i need to change to plug in LSTMLayer + RnnOutputLayer? Is it just change in the configuration of the model, or do I need to change how data is fed to it as well? Ok it's 100, and I have 10000 samples Is there an abstraction that will turn my 2d DataSet into 3d DataSet for RNN? 
solution: 

issue: tonythefreedom: not yet, I build the maven project in windows and submit the jar CenOS 
solution: nanyoullm: You need to make sure to change the classifier as mentioned above then. So the native deps for a given platform are separated now. 

issue: agibsonccc: Sorry, i did not understand clearly, could you explain more detail ?  ^^   i can run the example dl4j-0.4-example on my eclipse maven project in Window7.  And then i run maven install and submit the jar in spark (CenOS).

issue: agibsonccc: I believe that the reason why lagom target java is not because java is considered inherently better but for the same reasons as yours, industry needs. You will notice that it works on top of Play and Akka (spark maybe) that are developped on Scala. Nevertheless, I do understand your reasons about not blackboxing RL in scala so if it's your will to do RL in java, I understand.

I can't figure out how to make predictions once the model was built. this is the shape of the output vector for a 2 sentence translation: [3,2,4097,6,1,12,2,0,-1,99]. i see the 2,4097,6 match the shape of the inputs , vocab size and sentence min length. but it's not as easy as it was with the convnets or the lstms : )

solution: 

issue: Got CUDA working on Mac; still trying to get past Nd4jBackend$NoAvailableBackendException on Ubuntu 14.04, despite re-installs, etc. Is is best to pursue this here or in "tuning help"? 
solution: thealy: are you already on RC3.10?. 

issue: treo: @raver119changed to         <nd4j.version>0.4-rc3.10</nd4j.version><dl4j.version>0.4-rc3.10</dl4j.version> and got many 'package org.deeplearning4j.nn.conf... does not exist; can't find MultiLayerNetwork. This is Spark GravesLSTMCharModellingExample. Here is pom.xml [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Is there a comprehensive installation guideline for people without root access?This one has a lot of sudos: [<-LINK->] , which I can't get around 
solution: 

issue: treo: GravesLSTMCharModellingExample runs, but not on GPU. nvidia-smi shows no activity. 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: I already read and seems is more or less what I did agibsonccc: I already read and seems is more or less what I did 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: For instance, I don\'t have OpenBLAS. I\'m looking for a guideline that does not require me to install software in the sudo mode.I tried to install OpenBLAS to $HOME/OpenBLAS. LD_LIBRARY_PATH Points to $HOME/OpenBLAS/lib, but  I\'m getting "WARNING: Failed to load implementation from: com.github.fommil.netlib.NativeRefBLAS."Having a guideline that does not require me to install to /usr/lib, for instance, would help me debugging my configuration. 
solution: 

issue: Shotgunosine: Upgrade to rc3.10 It was a glibc issue We built it on centos 6 this time Shotgunosine: to be fair that's not hard to fix You just needed a later version of cmake cmake is known not to work from the package manager download a binary and put it in your path That should be enough Post to earlyadopters if ou run in to anything there again nah it's known not to work "Version issues" aren\'t usually an excuse to just stop trying ;) 
solution: If it doesn't work out of the box there's something else going on. 

issue: Testing rc3.10 works great in Win, but in ubuntu got:  no nd4j in java.library.path   &   no jnind4j in java.library.path hit@treo, just using native, worked fine on win64 but not in ubuntu is something needed in the pom for ubuntu? 
solution: 

issue: just discovered that Nd4j.ones(100).eps(1.0) gives me a result array of [0.73, 0.73, ...] seems very strange to me. looked at the code, in BaseNDArray.java, I have  [<-CODE->] the parameter "other" is not even used...  a bug? 
solution: That looks very much like a bug. 

issue: mossaab0: ,@treo,@agibsoncccJust gave 3.10 a try on Centos 6 and it built successfully. Running runallexamples.sh it seems like at least some of the examples run successfully. Just to clarify, 3.10 doesn't depend on OpenBlas any longer, correct? 
solution: 

issue: Do I need to scale my features ?  Or does Dl4j do that ? 
solution: qbert65536: No yo need to do that there\'s no "magic". 

issue: It looks like there's not a 3.10 for dl4j-spark, is one in the works or should just use dl4j-spark 3.9 with dl4j 3.10? 
solution: Shotgunosine: you now have to specify the scala version you are using. 

issue: JuhoKupiainen: Could you please clone the examples from scratch? and run those as is? 
solution: You mean building with maven instead of sbt?. 

issue: Hello, anyone to help with this error?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Is there anyone using dl4j for image classification? 
solution: 

issue: while mvn compile:canova-nd4j-common ................................. FAILUREI have installed javacpp, openblas, maven 3.3.9, java 1.8how set up canova? Could not find artifact org.nd4j:nd4j-api:jar:0.4-rc3.11-SNAPSHOT 
solution: 

issue: thealy: re: the minimum file size for GravesLSTMCharModellingExample: there wasn't intended to be any minimum. probably just not handling that case properly in the iterator. open an issue (or even better: send us a PR, if you work it out) 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I am writing my master's report and I am going to describe DL4J for a short paragrah in it. What would the main features of DL4J considered to be? I think I've read the main features here in the chat before, but I ask again just to make sure that I get it right 
solution: 

issue: I am new to this world of deep learning and I am intrested in programming a CNN to classify images, more presicely to label images into two classes: imgs with horses and images without horses, I got a labeled dataset and I want to do this task with a CNN, I have download these packages from maven central : deeplearning4j-core-0.4-rc3.9 and   nd4j-api-0.4-rc3.9, slf4j-api-1.7.21,  I just want to know where can I find a book or a tutorial to do this, and if I already got all the libs I need, cause I have been testing the example of CNN in deeplearning4j-examples-0.0.3.1 and is something about MNIST dataset but I cant make it work and I dont know if it is the same that my problem of horses.  Thanks in advance and forgive my english I speak spanish!!! 
solution: 

issue: hi, I dowload the rc-3.10 version ran the example MLPClassifierLinear in Windows system, but it did stop on line 84(model.fit()). I debug and find it stoped in org.nd4j.linalg.api.ndarray.BaseNDArray.  I can run the rc-3.09 in Windows but not Linux, but now I can run the rc-3.10 in Linux but not Windows. I just click the Run as Java application, and the console prints nothing... A little strange  , the program ends in BaseNDArray. But I cannot see the source code. 
solution: And while I changed the version in pom.xml to rc-3.09. The program can run normally. 

issue: Thanks@treolooks like linux-ppc64le linux-x86_64  macosx-x86_64 windows-x86_64  ,  I understand ARM is not there yet? First test on cpu are fantastic, great work guys :-) GPU is slower for me with small networks need to try with a bigger and longer one 
solution: 

issue: hi , downloaded dl4j-0.4-examples and imported in Intellij in my Mac (OS X EI Captain) when i run the Word2VecRawTextExample , it gives me an address in use exception while starting the UIServer there is no other process running on port 8080 or 80 how do i work around this any help ? 
solution: 

issue: Hi,for the  DBNIrisExample you delete ,it is not accurately only 0.6667,could you change some parameter to improve accuracy.I need this example. 
solution: 

issue: cuda never uses sli sli is for gaming only doesn't matters it's still sli inside 
solution: It automaticly handles it or uses only one. 

issue: Has someone  got the examples working with sbt? 
solution: Has someone  got the examples working with sbt?Yes, I only use SBT. 

issue: im trying to understand batchSize when passed to a ListDataSetIterator , is it updating parameters every batchSize # of passes ? 
solution: batchSize is the number of samples fetched from iterator for every iteration. 

issue: Do I need to import something for HistogramIterationListener ?  I can't seem to find it hah, I saw it in your gist just now 
solution: thisIsNiceName: I think the bias thing with the charts is just a display issue, maybe because they are all still essentially one value. 

issue: Hello guys, I got here some problems with memory.  [<-LINK->] 4096 or 6000 gives the same rror

issue: raver119: I am Karlisle from that issue with the weird groups raver119: this is my output: okay 
solution: 

issue: JuhoKupiainen: Im getting that error again after adding deeplearning-ui ,  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/bytedeco/javacpp/Pointer .  Is yours still working ? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: did you get the email with my corpus?= 
solution: 

issue: is there some way i can test/check whether  DL4J is using a second GPU? 
solution: 

issue: treo: yeah, it kinda worked...the error is another now: "make sure you have an nd4j backend on your classpath". But I never got this on windows, I wonder what I\'m missing to import/do to my other maching 
solution: 

issue: Added canova 0.0.0.16-SNAPSHOT, cleaned project (from cmd line) and still having same issue 
solution: jvence: You shouldn't need snapshot. 

issue: raver119: I\'m using SBT, so my build includes deeplearning4j by adding the following dependencies:, "org.deeplearning4j"          % "deeplearning4j-core"             % "0.4-rc3.10"//, "org.nd4j"                    % "nd4j-native"                     % "0.4-rc3.10" classifier "" classifier "linux-x86_64", "org.nd4j"                    % "nd4j-api"                        % "0.4-rc3.10", "org.nd4j"                    % "nd4j-cuda-7.5"                   % "0.4-rc3.10" As well as the resolver: resolvers += "sonatype snapshots" at " [<-LINK->] " raver119: Ok, that's my bad, I didn't include my platform classifier in the nd4j-cuda-7.5. , "org.nd4j" % "nd4j-cuda-7.5" % "0.4-rc3.10" classifier "" classifier "linux-x86_64" This works fine 
solution: 

issue: I\'m building on my windows the project to be run in linux. I get the error "Please ensure that you have an nd4j backend on your classpath.". I\'m probably missing a dependency? Can you help me? 
solution: 

issue: Has anyone had success running dl4j on a GPU without jcuda Do you just use CUDA then? 
solution: but at this (THIS) moment you can't compile yet, master is broken. 

issue: pretty much everyone who uses a version >= rc3.9 because it doesn't use jcuda since then 
solution: 

issue: Anyone have any 'big data tools' that they want to share ?  I'm starting to struggle to visualize all this weather data its becoming cumbersome 
solution: 

issue: If there's anything missing feel free to send us a pull request on the documentation We'd LOVE community involvement there It's just github pages markdown 
solution: 

issue: Hello there, need your help in understanding the ImageRecordReader and Labels mapping not having any exceptions  [<-CODE->] recordReader labels-->[TL, HD, ND] i believe the folders i have are transmitted into labels 
solution: 

issue: please don't paste that walls of text, use gist for that... and anyway, the labels look right you can't just put symbolic labels into a nn they have to be encoded [1, 0, 0] just means the first label in your case probably TL 
solution: there are two ways of using it, one is to put in a dataset, which will result in a list of strings. 

issue: Hey everyone, I have a new problem that is quite irritating. I'm trying to use a 3 dimensional INDArray. Apparently it doesn't let you use (0,0,-1) as a valid index. Though (0,-1,0) is fine. This makes no sense to me, almost seems like a bug. Any insights? 
solution: 

issue: justineyster: File an issue: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: hi all, I'm trying to make sense in to dl4s as it's a bit out of date right now.  My question is that what happened to outputPostProcessor?  also the override variable seems to MIA. if that sounds a bit generic, I'd really rather develop in scala, but it doesn't compile as of now so I can't start.  those two are and a couple others are the problem, so I was hoping that maybe I could just fix it. ok, same deal with the override and hiddenLayerSizes? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: thanks. Sorry I have the brain of a potato. I had installed the DL4J examples.. but not the full DL4J core 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I'm following the quickstart guide, when I try to run one of the examples I get this error: Intel MKL FATAL ERROR: Cannot load mkl_intel_thread.dll. 
solution: you will have to lookup your system environment variables, and see what you have set for PATH there, find where mkl_rt.dll is, and remove that from your path - so dl4j doesn't try to use mkl. I think that may actually be a bug, as it is supposed to load mkl correctly if it is on the path. 

issue: Does anyone have some experience using the Computation Graph? I'm doubting between making 3 separate models or combining the 3 in one Computation Graph. 1 input and 3 outputs. What would be the pros and cons? 
solution: 

issue: right, I mean you can maybe use fixed length plus padding, not sure how much performance will suffer though but yes, no max pooling over time yet 
solution: 

issue: The score in itself is meaningless, only the relative change so if your training score goes down, your system is learning if it goes down fast, it is learning fast if you want something more meaningful, you have to test your model based on its actual performance with your test set this looks very much like you have a custom repository set somewhere so it looks in a place where it can't possibly find anything 
solution: 

issue: hmm... not really sure what is going on there,@saudetcan you comment? 
solution: 

issue: Rupashree12: @JuhoKupiainenCan you guys chime in on what specifically you would like to see in the example? We get a lot of these questions so obviously we are missing a piece and it would be really great if you guys helped us fill it in. 
solution: 

issue: treo: I see you have suggested "org.bytedeco" % "sbt-javacv" % "1.6" as a solution to a problem similar to java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/bytedeco/javacv/OpenCVFrameConverter$ToMat treo: So the error changed its name: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no jniopencv_core in java.library.path Did you mean to link to this site? [<-LINK->] Just for completeness, I'm getting the twelvemonkeys error despite having the latest version of canova and  nd4j-cuda ^ the error that I linked to earlier. 
solution: 

issue: I am trying to run the ImageClassification example. As discussed here, I simply created a dir -img  and made 2 folders of labels with images inside it. I put this line in the code File Mainpath = new File("/home/vncuser/Desktop/img"). This throws the error \'no jniopencv_imgcodecs in java.library.path. I am not sure where am I going wrong saudet: @qbert65536I have libopencv_java249.so file in /usr/lib/jni and I am running my application with -Djava.library.path = /usr/lib/jni/libopencv_java249.so  but still getting the same error. 
solution: 

issue: HiShould i add the nd4j-jblas to my pom.xml file if I want GPU suport? 
solution: 

issue: yep, proper example is going up too, soon. probably won't be merged until next release though, because it relies on some functionality in canova master  [<-ISSUE->] butmostof that example is usable now path label generator is in latest canova release the idea for that is to go from image path -> label anyway, have a read of the comments in that example, see if it answers your questions the example is here: [<-LINK->] the path label generator stuff is here: [<-LINK->] for images - data augmentation is just stuff like random crops, warping etc - again, see the example I linked above it's brand new, so it's not documented yet 
solution: 

issue: is there any more to that stack trace? 
solution: no. 

issue: Rupashree12: if you are getting that error, you are most likely using gradle or sbt? 
solution: 

issue: @raver119I added the following lines to my pom.xml file for the GPU support<dependency><groupId>org.nd4j</groupId><artifactId>nd4j-cuda-7.5</artifactId><version>${nd4j.version}</version></dependency>However, maven says that the artifact is missing. Missing artifact org.nd4j:nd4j-cuda-7.5:jar:0.4-rc3.8 ok, thx 
solution: 

issue: Improving writing that way was one of the ideas I had as well... But I don't think it will help anyone write any clearer at least not if the person itself doesn't really know what they are talking about :D 
solution: 

issue: I'm trying to run the MLPClassifierLinear example and I'm getting an error: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/canova/api/split/InputSplit. Can someone point me in the right direction here? 
solution: saudet: @treoThank you very much! Workaround for gradle works. 

issue: How can I import DBN into my code? I have tried the followings and none of them work for me: [<-CODE->] And [<-CODE->] Anyone? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. raver119: that helped thanks. 

issue: agibsonccc: Hello guys, I'm trying ro run some training on a centOS machine but I've got some errors. On windows the same code works well. There is any change I've to do? alirezahajibagheri: sorry the message is not only for you *@agibsonccc The error is like some classes are not found on the class path. I\'m running like this "java -Xms6144m -Xmx6144m -cp "app.jar:lib/*" org.deeplearning.test > stdout.txt 2> stderr.txt" if I run on windows works well changing the ":" to ";" sure  [<-LINK->] seems some native libs are miss right? 
solution: 

issue: cewhitridge: are you using eclipse by any chance? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. and i guess mvn clean install had finished wirth build success?. 

issue: hi everyone :) I'm trying to get nd4j + cuda working on my OSX machine on a Clojure project.. my deps look like [<-CODE->] but I keep getting: [<-CODE->] and then core dump and exit  [<-CODE->] any ideas? :/ 
solution: 

issue: several things first, use rc3.10 
solution: third: a full coredump is needed to see whats up. 

issue: hello guys I need a hand. I've a project running on windows without no problems. I want now run on a unix machine, waht I've to change? when I try to run I've got some error,s I think was miss native libraries perhaps I've a folder with all jars and I'm starting it with a .sh file. 
solution: 

issue: Guys, I'd appreciate if anyone could point out how the deeplearning4j-examples-0.4-rc0-SNAPSHOT-bin.jar is different from deeplearning4j-examples-0.4-rc0-SNAPSHOT.jar , and why both were provided as part of the package? 
solution: and they aren't provided - you only get that if you run something like mvn package. AlexDBlack: Cool. I\'ll keep that in mind. Also, any idea how we can implement the equivalent of -Djava.library.path="" when compiling from command line.. 

issue: merishav: HiAny body there ?I am training word2vecit treats each single word as token ...but I want it to treat paired words together like prime minister, software engineerwhat should I do ? 
solution: to treat words together,it should be aware about the semantics. 

issue: agibsonccc: @AlexDBlackI am taking a break so I won't hang around on gitter but if someone want to do RL and find [<-LINK->] useful and need support, tell him to shoot me an email 
solution: 

issue: Oh thanks its a bit complicated for me now :). So what should i start with if, as output, i want to receive simple java app for image recognition? should i just read docs on deeplearning4j page? i guess image recognition is not the simplest one to begin with right? 
solution: to be fair, dl4j targets a slightly different audience. so more powerful, but less beginner friendly perhaps than neuroph. 

issue: merishav: You're moving from java to python for production? o_0 You're a first I've done quite a bit with UIMA already. Are you using cleartk or..? 
solution: Python has zero features for scaling. 

issue: hi i am trying to setup [<-LINK->] with the lfw example but i am getting a nullpointer like this: [<-LINK->] 
solution: wahed_he_twitter: Take a look through this: [<-ISSUE->]. It's not done yet but should give you an idea of what the tutorial is trying to do. 

issue: while training ? 
solution: or, once again, use another (not-whitespace one) tokenizer. 

issue: Hey guys, I'm getting  'Process finished with exit code 2' when I run model.fit(dataset).  I can't figure out why.I'm running version 0.4-rc3.10 (dl4j and nd4j)- POM is same as dl4j-examples POM. I wasn't having this issue yesterday, and today I've tried running a snapshot of yesterday's working code, and now model.fit(dataset) is returning exit code 2 and not finishing execution.Any ideas?  What is exit code 2?? 
solution: 

issue: Are you using anaconda? 
solution: I woudn't know how or why.... but it sounds plausible. 

issue: At the Word2Vec page on Dl4J it is written that Skipgram is a 2-layer neural network. But in some articles they explain hidden layers of the Skip gram model (transposing and inverting the matrix) hidden layer* 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: What's the process for getting a pull request approved and merged? 
solution: Did a brief look - fairly simple fix. 

issue: Anyone can explain me why there is such a variation in model scores? Sometimes it starts at 12, other times 3, or even 0.10.. 
solution: You guy come in batches on purpose don't you? :P. 

issue: agibsonccc: is there  a  separate deeplearning4j-nlp library for scaleout as I don't see any train method for Word2Vec  ?  I have this dependency           <dependency><groupId>org.deeplearning4j</groupId><artifactId>deeplearning4j-core</artifactId><version>0.4-rc3.10</version></dependency> [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: right, specifics really help - screenshots and hardware configurationsfwiw some configurations (like a gtx970 vs. a 5930k or similar) we're definitely seeing gpus as faster still not perfectly optimized though faster on rnns that is 
solution: 

issue: In my model I want to predict t+1(many to many case), and I have time series that are quite long - 100k samples. Is it better so specify some fixed time series length, say 1k, and slice that training data into 100 x 1k samples? Or rather keep is as a whole? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: got the output working - turns out my 96% accuracy isn't so useful after all xD think I need to extend my training data somewhat..  but, it's all working! :) 
solution: 

issue: I need to merge two datasets but I can't seem to get the merge syntax correct. Can someone help please? DataSet trainingData = DataSet.merge(List(DS1,DS2)); isn't working 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: sorry, went to a meeting. thanks for the info! gonna do a proof-of-concept using just the native libs first, to convince my team... 
solution: ... then my plan is to try and set it up to run on cuda for machines that have that, and cpu (maybe via mkl) otherwise. 

issue: yeah, understood, I've gone through similar things in the past with e.g. custom builds of theano on top of multicore openblas... not in the jvm world tho 
solution: 

issue: Headsup; I think either WordVectorSerializer.writeWordVectors and/or WordVectorSerializer.loadTxtVectors is also broken in 0.4-rc3.10 
solution: If you can give us something to reproduce it please do. 

issue: It's already fixed in current master Other issue is fixed too Yes 
solution: A; great!. 

issue: I don't quire understand how this works. With mini batches we calculate updates for multiple samples using GPU parallelism and then make single update to the parameters, right? Does this work different with Spark? 
solution: 

issue: Hey, i want to program an event system - dont know if it is better to use one interface and annotations or one interface for each event. Can anyone help me? Pros and cons? 
solution: paister, this is support channel for one specific deep learning framework. 

issue: Hello, this may be a silly question but I\'m getting a "java: package org.canova.image.transform" does not exist? Does anyone know what how I can resolve this issue? 
solution: 

issue: Ah, that second INDArrayIndex does the trick. How do I interpret this? Does this mean get me an interval (start, end) starting from point (0)? 
solution: and you get the sub array for the interval along the rows dimension, but just one point on the column dimension. does that make sense? essentially you are specifying a rectangular sub-array; the first index specifies which rows you want, the second specifies which columns you want. 

issue: Does Canova provide a functionality to transform libsvm format to nd4j objects saudet: Thanks! 
solution: 

issue: Might I suggest a name change for the read/write methods in WordVectorSerializer? For writing Word Vectors we have writeWordVectors and for reading it back in it is loadTxtVectors. From an API perspective it is better to have these aligned. (Sorry; my day time job includes software architecture and a lot of reviews  Call it an occupational hazard) 
solution: 

issue: Does anyone teach me how to transform libsvm format data to NDArray RecordConverter.toArray return null for Collection[Writable] got by using LibSvmRecordReader. my version of RecordConverter may be old. /** [<-CODE->] I avoied by using latest RecordConverter.java [<-LINK->] libraryDependencies += "org.nd4j" % "canova-nd4j-common" % "0.0.0.16"does not work for LibSvmRecordReader RecordReader recordReader = new LibSvmRecordReader(numLinesToSkip,delimiter);recordReader.initialize(new FileSplit(new ClassPathResource("iris.txt").getFile())); [<-CODE->] Can I use like above? 
solution: 

issue: Say, if I were to setParams on multiple networks using the same ndarray object, would all of them modify it when.fitis called? ok, so no easy parameter sharing that way :D Maybe that is related to@OliverScheel's problem? the Parameters have to fit into memory twice? 
solution: and i just tried, i can write the mdoel with any method (using file and filestream) without errors. 

issue: treo: huh what awefully low 2 GB? I didnt know java could take more .. but ill increase it 
solution: AlexDBlack: I\'m currently re-reading the NLP from scratch paper, and just had the Idea that something like that might "just work" due to a coincidence :D. 

issue: What is the score value is acceptable? depend on data? [main] INFO org.deeplearning4j.optimize.listeners.ScoreIterationListener - Score at iteration 1100 is 2304.285888671875 2304.? I need wait it to be 0.? 
solution: 

issue: the record(uri, dataInputStream) method on RecordReader -- do I actually need to implement that? all I want to do is read from a collection of existing objects (conjecture sparse vectors with labels) and map each one into an ndarray to train on 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys , this may be a silly question. I've updated my Maven dependencies to include Canova 0.0.0.16, but IntelliJ still can't resolve ShowImageTransform. Any ideas as to why? 
solution: 

issue: alirezahajibagheri: just check examples, all of those (except w2v/d2v) run on CUDA all you need is to switch dependency in pom.xml alirezahajibagheri: use nd4j-cuda-7.5 as backend there alirezahajibagheri: make sure you don’t have cpu backend in your pom, and then you’ll be fine 
solution: agibsonccc: you are talking about Dataset from this right?. 

issue: LibSvmRecordReader does not support libsvm format with sparse vector representations ? 
solution: We can set the dimension of feature vector space by usingconf.setInt(LibSvmRecordReader.NUM_FEATURES, 110). 

issue: bigtwindgeny: and are you using eclipse, by any chance? 
solution: 

issue: What is the scale of the dropout hyperparameter? 0 to 1? Is it probability of picking a node and resetting it to 0? 
solution: and yes, it is the probability of resetting an input to 0. 

issue: 0.0 is the default value. "keeping activation" you mean passing along the value of the activation function or passing 0.0? 
solution: keeping an activation means not setting it to zero :). it's rescaled to ensure the average activation is constant. 

issue: nice, so I learned today that I've had dropout way too high in my last experiments :D 
solution: 

issue: What happened to democracy? I WANT MY 100% DROUPOUT IN MY NET! Forking dl4j right away xD

issue: I am loading a glove word vectors model as described in the documentation: WordVectors wordVectors = WordVectorSerializer.loadTxtVectors(new File("glove.6B.50d.txt")); and I got this Exception: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 49 I used to do that with an earlier version of DL4J and it used to work... Hi@raver119:) 
solution: 

issue: I use Maven to load DL4J, can I just copy paste the method? 
solution: Zixxy: still sounds like what I described, you simply put in the distance vector and output points on the map. you can certainly add your reference points on to that, but I don't think that they are going to improve the results. 

issue: Hello, I already have a Spark machine learning Pipeline and would like to try out deeplearning4j. I found dl4j-spark-ml but wonder if this has been deprecated? So there's no pipeline support at the moment? But converting a Spark dataframe to an RDD with LabeledPoint should work? 
solution: 

issue: sounds like an edge case bug... can you open an issue with code that reproduces that? 
solution: 

issue: Does anyone know if the CSVDataSetIterator uses the Google WordVector model to vectorize words 
solution: 

issue: OliverScheel: Read up on your linear algebra fundamentals: [<-LINK->] cewhitridge: No it doesn't OliverScheel: Not sure how you've been using dl4j all this time out the basics - but every other DL framework uses these exact same concepts "Multiple examples" is just a shape of 1 ndarray thanks 
solution: 

issue: can't I ignore them? I'll cook some filter up that'll remove them then. 
solution: Just redo the pre processing there. dl4j comes with apache commons lang. so you have access to most of the FileUtils and the like out of the box. 

issue: Hi! Do you know any working example of deeplearning4j working on android built with gradle? The only I've found is [<-LINK->] . It's is old (uses nd4j-x86 and 3.8 instead of native and 3.10) and it doesn't work. Tested on x86 android device 
solution: 

issue: I have a JavaRDD with org.nd4j.linalg.dataset.DataSet instances in it. As soon as I print an element from that RDD I get a NullPointerException in org.nd4j.linalg.api.shape.Shape/rank. Any ideas? DOes this has something to do with what kind of nd4j backend I use? raver119: sure, here's my stacktrace [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: it’ll be easier to say, when you’ll show your stack trace  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: treo: I found this bug report [<-ISSUE->] I'm trying to get a snaphot or build the latest version 
solution: 

issue: hello, I'm just starting out with dl4j. What iterator do I need to use to convert java objects or matrices to DataSet's? raver119: yeah, trying it out now, I'm a bit confused though.I have a collection of arrays of 3 values (they represent timeseries)Does that mean that the arrays should be 3x1xlist.size or ...? 
solution: 

issue: treo: I had to write my own KryoSerializer because, I actually need 2 of them. Spark 2.0 will allow comma separated classes for the spark.kryo.registrator system property, so I can remove that too soon. Anyway, now everything runs as expected. :) 
solution: 

issue: Is there a simpler way to do data normalisation on images (by extracting DataSet from Iterators)? At the moment I'm loading the files using a ImageRecordReader, then using .next(1000000) to convert it to a DataSet, doing my normalisation (dividing it by 128 to get from RGB to % intensity), then converting it back to a Sampling *SamplingDataSetIterator. It seems clumsy, but can't find a better way. At some point it is causing a bug too, since my Test DataSet  shows a different number of positive / negative examples each epoch. Thanks - working through the examples now 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I am trying to tune my 4-layer network. I am following the tutorials: [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->] , but my network graphs looks  nothing like explained. I have been playing around with hyperparameters, but I am not sure what is possibly going wrong here - [<-LINK->] Following is the gist of my code: [<-LINK->] Sure. 
solution: 

issue: Hi ,First of all, Thanks guys for the great work !I have few questions regarding the library.1- Does it support GPU on mobile device (i.e. Android devices) or only the desktop machines ?2- Is there any benchmark that compares the performance against other libraries such as (cblas or OpenBLAS) ? treo: : Thanks for your reply.so you mean that ND4J does not support Android ? but the main page says that "Deploys on Android." ? is there explanation for that 
solution: not a priority for us right now, as none of our paying customers are asking for it. 

issue: malzantot: at the moment android isn't supported at all and, internally openblas is used, so no reason to benchmark against it 
solution: 

issue: Are there any methods to train MLP classifier concurrently without spark or any other frameowrk. just only using threads or Akka. 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: yaeh, my red/black/diff are very small. I multiply them to get in the range of 100 to -100.If I try to train it using a LSTM, my fourth epoch has a score of NaN though a range of 1 and -1 makes no difference 
solution: 

issue: Hey, which model does version 0.4-rc3.9 of paragraph vector uses? Is that PV-DM or PV-DBOW ? k, thanks! 
solution: 

issue: I am working with the ParagraphVectorsClassifierExample and tried to enable GPU use to speed up the training. In pom.xml, I changed only <nd4j.backend>nd4j-cuda-7.5</nd4j.backend> and to my surprise, it runs significantly slower. 
solution: 

issue: raver119: Hi again :) I tried to create my jar file again and now I am getting the no backend exception even on the server Here is my pom [<-LINK->] 
solution: print out your PATH env variable from java. 

issue: I am trying to train a deep MLP with 32 embedding layers (12 have dimension of 64 and others 32), two hidden layers of size 200 and a softmax of size 22 possible outputs (with batchsize of 10k). When I start to train with 48 threads by setting OMP_NUM_THREADS=48 (my machine has 24 cores), based on what ScoreIterationListener reports, each iteration takes 30 seconds (my data has about 2M instances). Am I doing sth wrong that this takes this much? 
solution: 

issue: rasoolims: could you please file an issue about your performance? 
solution: from data dimensionality perspective - you’re fine, you data is big enough for parallel stuff. so we should check what’s up there on java side, and i’m wrong guy for that. 

issue: raver119: before check the nearest word to "day", vec.getWordVectorMatrix("day") is [0.08 blabla] and is the same in file "pathToWriteto.txt" , after it run the nearest word to "day", vec.getWordVectorMatrix("day")  changes to [0.00496 blabla]. Why is that?  My program is as follows."String filePath = new ClassPathResource("raw_sentences.txt").getFile().getAbsolutePath(); [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: chuchuhuang: , pastebin is block sometime, can consider using this: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: saudet: ok thanks, i see. for me though the problem is that i have my results to test in a different folder, or i load my model so when i do the testing i do not have the train iter ... thus i dont see how i can call initialize with the labels again? 
solution: 

issue: ThatGuyFromFinland: i don't want to disappoint you, but ANY framework that uses CUDA - behaves the same way. CUDA do NOT honor small data dimensions. That applies to ANY framework, so i'm not sure how that might feel bad for anyone, who's using CUDA daily... 
solution: 

issue: thisIsNiceName: , I prepared my data with batch renamer (added a letter before the file name), and kept all samples in the same folder. I'm not sure if classifying the data into folders will work. I guess that imput data should be randomized. 
solution: if that's fine for you - then AbstractCache is the implementation you want. 

issue: also I don't see a learning rate there. or an updater at the very minimum, you'll want Updater.SGD but pretty much anything else (momentum, adagrad, rmsprop, adam, etc) will be better 
solution: 

issue: raver119: but individual axes can't go about Int.MaxValue, right? 
solution: I meant size of each axis, not number of axes, sorry. andrewclegg: The length can yes. but if you look at something like putScalar the coordinates are ints or arrays of ints... is there another way to get data in, that gets around that?. 

issue: Hi there. First day with dl4j. Wanted to check Word2Vectors. Git cloned the native blas libs and executed the two scripts. ./setuposx.sh and ./buildnativeoperations.sh -c cpu (on osx). Created a new maven project, added dependencies and wrote a few lines that takes sentences from System.in  and instantiated a Word2Vec that iterates using a BasicLineIterator(System.in). When i try to run the application it throws an Runtime and IOException Caused by: java.io.IOException: Resetting to invalid mark and printed debug info could not scan file org/nd4j/nativeblas/macosx-x86_64/libiomp5.dylib ... .m2/repository ...What's wrong, do I have to set a path or something. How do I get the native libs installed in the local .m2 repository? What does the error want to tell me? 
solution: 

issue: I found a bug in the code and reported it (and now it is fixed). How can use the bug-free code? [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: raver119: one more Q: is there any implementation of ASGD in DL4J?. rasoolims:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Does anyone know if installation of the CUDA toolkit is now required for nd4j-0.4-rc3.10? Earlier it looked like you could get away with just using the CPU. Can you just not make that subproject in nd4j? 
solution: you still can use cpu-only. 

issue: Are there any tools that work with dl4j to visualize models, i.e. see which inputs have more weight, how they interact, etc. ? 
solution: That's an open ended research question in deep learning. 

issue: damn, I need a job where I have to work with all this stuff xD 
solution: 

issue: how do i utilize the model i trained in an aws gpu instance? or is it gone once i shut it down? 
solution: sheetalgiri: There is probably a way to save the model to disk and to load it when you need it.. I guess the model only contains the trained results. All settings could be easily stored in a properties file or as static fields in a Constants class or sth. like tha. 

issue: Hi. How to add custom activation function? Just having some idea I'd like to experiment. I guess I'd need to validate it on some other prototype before giving it more effort. Calculating derivative is not so hard ;)

solution: 

issue: So, I have local word2vec running on rc3.10 fine, and now I am trying distributed word2vec. However, I get a NullPointerException caused by "cannot evaluate org.nd4j.linalg.cpu.nativecpu.NDArray.toString()"  when Syn0UpdateEntry.getSecond() is called. (i am a startup with scala btw, :-) ) 
solution: 

issue: What\'s the data_path ? public static final String DATA_PATH = FilenameUtils.concat(System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir"), "dl4j_w2vSentiment/"); 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: So for the sentiment analysis I have to provide two sets of positive and negative sentiment? That's too much work to do. my vectors are based on political news articles. what else can I classifiy? topic? 
solution: 

issue: Here is the gist@agibsonccc: [<-LINK->] Not very useful, I get more interesting data with a breakpoint in intellij and inspecting state. 
solution: There's usually a root cause somewhere. 

issue: When I try to execute the code  "UiServer server = UiServer.getInstance();"      ----------    I am receiving these Exception ------- Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerErrorat org.deeplearning4j.examples.nlp.word2vec.Word2VecRawTextExample.main(Word2VecRawTextExample.java:58)  [<-LINK->] I had insstaled the latest on my system 
solution: 

issue: Is this with a fresh clone of the examples as is no customizations? I told you what the error was already hm hold on let me reproduce it first Which example are you running? I'm 100% sure the problem is between chair and keyboard here I just ran it fine Fresh clone I'm not sure what your'e doing different but I can't reproduce it You having a version clash is you either not updating your pom right or it's you not having a fresh clone of the examples  [<-LINK->] Here's my run of it All it does is starts the UI 
solution: That gist came from those exact set of actions. 

issue: agibsonccc: Cheers! its work for fresh clone, Thank you for your help indeed! 
solution: but untangling that hairball usually means understanding a bit about maven. It can be do able but I wouldn't recco for just running an example. 

issue: Does anyone know the serialization incantation for org.deeplearning4j.spark.models.embeddings.word2vec.Word2Vec? It looks like [<-LINK->] does not have a good overload. For serializing spark generated word2vec models. I can't find the machinery in WordVectorSerializer. Its methods have overloads for many subclasses of WordVectors, like Glove and Word2Vec, but not for the spark version of Word2Vec. 
solution: WordVectorSerializer does not have overloads for the spark Word2Vec neither for the general WordVectors interface, so I don't see how I can serialize the spark Word2Vec.. 

issue: Hi, still playing with spark word2vec. It is definitively super fast, so fast I was even a bit suspicious of it. And indeed results are not making much sense. When I run about a 1M phrases over both the local word2vec implementation and the spark word2vec one, I get very distinct results. My corpus is the portuguese commoncrawl, but one easy check to see if things are healthy is check whether english words get close to each other. See the results: Spark Word2Vec predictions for day:me, proprias, uol, sorvete, melhoriaDriver Word2Vec predictions for day:guide, five, number, song, makingSpark Word2Vec predictions for google:borboleta, carrinho, pinos, importa, moldesDriver Word2Vec predictions for google:chrome, firefox, explorer, windows, mozilla So, it seems that Spark Word2Vec results are not making much sense.@raver119, are there any known bugs in rc3.10? Did you check the spark implementation from the result quality perspective? Would love to help if there is anything I can do to collect further information and nail this. 
solution: 

issue: davireis: spark w2v was fixed at 3.9, and in 3.9/3.10 should be giving proper results can i have mode details on everything you have there? i need details to investigate what could go wron 
solution: 

issue: hey@raver119, sure, let me paste some details on [<-ISSUE->] now. 
solution: problems you're referring sound like and old problem i've investigated few months ago on standalone. 

issue: I tried to run DeepWalk on a graph with roughly 150k vertices. I got an exception while it is trying to build Huffman tree - "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: Cannot generate code: code length exceeds 64 bits".  I observed that the MAXCODE LENGTH is defined as 64 in GraphHuffman. Please do advise. 
solution: 

issue: I see. But in my case I have a lot of data per epoch, which means that each partition is quite big (e.g., 1 hour training). Won't the vectors deviate too much from the seed? 
solution: Right. The context is the corpora, and the partitions share each one the same distributions. So, the partitions will learn similar models.. 

issue: Hi! I'm trying to set up a convolutional network to classify rgb images and I keep getting a NaN score I was wondering if any of you guys encountered this issue and also was wondering if it might be because the images aren't normalized 
solution: 

issue: yep, looks correct. post the full error/exception in a gist? 
solution: 

issue: Im getting "package org.deeplearning4j.models.embeddings.loader does not exist". This package should be included with dl4j correct? 
solution: it's deeplearning4j-nlp. 

issue: Hey everyone.  I have a short question about the code example from the CNN tutorial ( [<-LINK->] ).I had a look at the mnistdatafetcher. If I understand correctly it's fetching the image as float[]. Is it correct that the image is represented by a feature vector instead of a feature matrix?How do square kernels work on that? I guess I missed something somewhere. I hope you can help. 
solution: but yeah, the 1d vector gets reshaped to 3d (height/width/depth) by a preprocessor. 

issue: No 3.10 version of nd4s? 
solution: 

issue: a lot of boilerplate@wmeddie:D 
solution: 

issue: Also@savan77python is just an interface, it doesn't make the DL slower 
solution: 

issue: Thanks.  My first question is how do I know what backend I am using??   It was really easy to get working.  I expected to have to install mkl or alternative native library but it looks like maven does that automatically?? Using windows 10.  Maven and eclipse. 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: following the morning's question about the MNIST classifier, it works for me as is -- Thanks! wonder if there any code implementing the elastic distortion? 
solution: 

issue: The word vectors are already dense They are already pre trained It wouldn't help much and if anything you'd lose information Maybe if you were combining it with other features? I'm talking about word2vec not bag of words 
solution: 

issue: Now, I'm constructing the developing env. for dl4j on intellij. but,  In the NeuralNetConfiguration.java, I got an error about "Cannot resolve method \'getLayer()\' " for Layer.java . 
solution: 

issue: I read somewhere that DL4J could read Caffe models (and others?) but I couldn't find this in the javadoc -- is this still a work in progress? 
solution: 

issue: but they still have to be configured, even if it is just copy & paste 
solution: 

issue: i\'m a beginner in eclipse and maven. How can i know the version of JVM 64 bits or 32 bits?  I am using Eclipse and Windows 7 and i have this error  "no jnind4j in java.library.path". i use windows 7 32 bits. i can install JVM 64 bits ?? 
solution: 

issue: Hi there ... I am trying to use the CUDA support but can\'t get it to work. The java process starts on the GPU and nvidia-smi shows me some GPU utilisation. But then suddenly I receive an "Can\'t allocate [HOST] memory" exception from the cud layer in dl4j. Actually the system has 128GB RAM and I tried already assigning huge heap sizes (90GB) without any success ... do you have any advice? The current error message is : CudaZeroHandler.memcpyAsync H2H failed 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I have a stupid question, when I follow the instruction to run the maven clean install there are always error message

issue: Hi again.I\'ve got an "Length must be >= 1" IllegalArgumentException during ComputationGraph.init().Any idea where I have to look to fix this?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: How do you write  1.0 / 1 + exp(-error) in Nd4j? (particulary how do you negate an INDArray)? oh hold on. I see a Transforms.neg 
solution: wmeddie: there's lots of ops available. and all of them are cpu/gpu native. 

issue: Is there a way to make an executor that only runs on the gpu or cpu? 
solution: include required backend, and it'll be used. no, not at this moment. 

issue: hello again. I removed the native reference in my cuda NN application and cleaned up all artefacts and build caches to make sure there is no "obsolete" native nd4j stuff used anymore. Unfortunately the issue remains the same. I tried to tidy it up a little bit in the following gist: [<-LINK->] 
solution: I would love to send it but unfortunately it is a customer project and I am not allowed to share it. Is there a particular part that would help? Maybe I can free it from all customer related stuff?. 

issue: I don't seeNd4j.getExecutioner().iamax()??  Do I need a newer version or something??  I am using 0.4-rc3.10 
solution: 

issue: We're now running with spark on the same 8 K80 linux server. I can see that it uses the GPU with nvidia-smi, but the utilization is very low and highly fluctuating: from 5%-63%. It also still uses only one GPU. I am running your GravesLSTMCharModellingExample spark example. Here's a typical performance result: [<-LINK->] raver119: I did this, but it made no difference. I see lines that indicate all the threads are assigned to device[0] See [<-LINK->] raver119: Here: [<-LINK->] OK, see here: [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: manuelesimi: @fac2003please, build from current master libnd4j and nd4j, and run again. 

issue: fac2003: i guess it's due to forced single gpu there's such an option for cuda add CudaEnvironment.getInstance().getConfiguration().allowMultiGPU(true); add this as first line of your main() method show full output please fac2003: file an issue please, that's definitely wrong behavior multi-gpu handling is already changed/improved on current master, but i'd like to make sure your issue isn't reproducible now

issue: Beginner question. I downloaded dl4j-0.4-examples and ran LenetMnistExample.java successfully, but then I tried to use gpu acceleration ( [<-LINK->] ) by changing the nd4j-native to n4j-cuda-7.5 in my pom.xml, and I get this error:Caused by: org.nd4j.linalg.factory.Nd4jBackend$NoAvailableBackendException: Please ensure that you have an nd4j backend on your classpath.Am I missing something trivial? 
solution: 

issue: Hi...I just swiched for CPU to GPU backend, but i din't noticed any difference in terms of speed is this normal?

solution: 

issue: Hello. I would like to ask if someone has created a class in Scala that inherits from DataSetIterator. I can't manage to override setPreProcessor. The definition states that it returns void in Java, but when I define it as returning Unit in Scala it doesn't recognize it as overriding the original function. and if define the function only with def and not override def it asks me to override it properly. So I'm stuck   Any help or hints will be really appreciated The definition in DataSetIterator.java is void setPreProcessor(DataSetPreProcessor preProcessor); 
solution: 

issue: I have no problems extending DataSetIterator.  Are you using ScalaIDE? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I'm having trouble reloading a word2vec model, both when saved/reloaded with writeWordVectors/loadTextVectors and writeFullModel/loadFullModel. Is this a known issue? I'm using  0.4-rc3.10, the exception I get with loadTxtVectors is [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: Hi, running example word2vecrawtextexample.java, gives dropwizard error: unrecognized field at: template. Removing template and defaultName field from dropwizard.yml solves the issue. So was wondering, is it a bug?

issue: Quick question guys -- I am trying to write a new "NaNToNum" Transform, but it doesn\'t perform any action when I feed it to the executioner turns out that the issue is with overloading opNum() could you tell me where this number is used? 
solution: 

issue: I followed the steps for running the example files but it seems that it is not able to download the required files. I am getting around 100 file not found errors. Any idea to resolve this problem? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: just to confirm, would I have the CudaEnvironment.getInstance().getConfiguration()... in my java code? 
solution: 

issue: Sorry, from earlier when you gave instructions  on how to set the max single device memory allocation for GPU... The method setMaximumSingleDeviceAllocation() is something that I would just call once in my java code, correct? 
solution: yes, in your case you want to call it only once, somewhere at the beginning of your main() method.  however, technically all options could be changed in runtime as much, as you want.. 

issue: Hi, I am a newbie for word2vec, just follow the document to have a taste but got an error, could anyone give some suggestions what's going on?

issue: Hi guys, I'm using spark module for convolutional net training and I'm experiencing a lot of executors lost during training. I have 1 master, 6 workers with 8 cores and 6G memory each, training a dataset of 15k images with a 6 layers network. I noticed that playing with batchSize, and examplesPerFit and numPartitions parameters in fitDataSet function the situation change a little bit but never gets stable. I tried with batch size 1 (very long training, not handling parallelism I guess), 32 and 5 (gets broken at some point) and using 48(tot. number of cores) as examplesPerFit and numPartitions.  Do you have any suggestion about how to set those parameters? Is my cluster enough or I need more memory? 0.4-rc3.10 is not enough then? ok, I noticed myself some performances issues, i'll try new version

When i try network.output(loader.asMatrix(new File("data/20img/1.png"))) I get an error : java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid input: expect output columns must be equal to rows 32 x columns 32 but was instead [1, 32] 
solution: 

issue: are you using latest nd4j/dl4j? 
solution: Yeah, I just figured it out. Was using the wrong build . Found the solution [<-LINK->]. haven't seen sbt classifiers. It's outside the scope of DL4j, but was a bit confused. Thanks for the help. 

issue: yeah, that's a known issue with native binaries build on windows results in windows binaries being  bundled but not the linux ones there is a workaround using maven classifiers no, you just need to change your pom file to bundle the linux binaries instead I thought we had it written up somewhere 
solution: kkunan: anyway, I think it should just be a case of using <classifier>linux-x86_64</classifier> under the nd4j-native depedency. Now it caused 'Caused by: org.nd4j.linalg.factory.Nd4jBackend$NoAvailableBackendException: Please ensure that you have an nd4j backend on your classpath. Please see: [<-LINK->] ' both on windows & linux. 

issue: Um... maybe this is a stupid problem but really confuse me. With the progress of regression training, the error becomes bigger and bigger. Did the "identity" activation have some special requirements about input? For example, between -1 and 1? thanks first, I will try it hope it can solve the problem The train result is always converge to the mean of  train set output when using "identity". It seems the model is just a line. What\'s wrong? I just want to fit a curve. So maybe i stuck into a local minimum value... I am sorry about my words. 
solution: 

issue: Theoretically, can all the functions be fitted by neural work? I used to think if there is enough complexity, we can at least get an enough small error in the examples. 
solution: Right but the more the parameters the larger of a space it needs to search. 

issue: I\'m trying to run the word2vec example on windows 10. However it gives an exception  "java.lang.RuntimeException: com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException: Can not instantiate value of type ...]". I didn\'t modify anything. What is the problem? treo: Thank you! 
solution: 

issue: I've create a list( each for training/testing), add my huge DataSet, create a ListDataSetIterator with my list I hope that works :D //Get the best model:MultiLayerNetwork bestModel = result.getBestModel(); this line doesn't work casting to MultiLayerNetwork seems ok 
solution: 

issue: I'm using MultiLayerConfiguration, pretrain=true, 4 hidden layers, 400 neurons each, learning rate 0.01, l2 regularization coeff 1.00E-03, dropout rate 0.5, 1000 epochs. My train error is always going to 0, but my verification error is around 9%. I'd like to increase the regularization to keep from overtraining, bring my train error up into a more similar range with my verifcation error. making l2 reg 10x larger (1e-2)didn't seem to do anything. Any advice on how i accomplish this? I'm not sure the configuration is relevant since I'm just asking how to increase regularization so as to raise training error. but sure.  [<-LINK->] is this a big enough chunk? er.. it pasted it into the chat window it's from an example; idk if i need it or not k well i have 2 tihngs to look at anyhow any advice on regularization? 
solution: for both the learning rate and the momentum. 

issue: Hi, I'm using dl4j:0.4-rc3.10 and trying to load glove model withWordVectorSerializer.loadTxtVectors. I getArrayIndexOutOfBoundsline 1107 (vector[i-1] = Float.parseFloat(split[i]);)  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: anybody have issues with the dropwizard.yml file upon running examples i.e. i tried running the word2vec example and get an error saying the template and defaultName fields aren't valid when i comment them out i start to get log info but the error i get is Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: java.net.BindException: Address already in use: bind 
solution: 

issue: m also facing this issue C:\\Users\\hp\\DeepLearningProjects\\dl4j-0.4-examples\\target\\classes\\dropwizard.yml has an error:Unrecognized field at: templateDid you mean?:\nserver\nmetrics\nuploadPath\nlogging so i commented out  UiServer server = UiServer.getInstance();System.out.println("Started on port " + server.getPort()); 
solution: 

issue: that sounds like some version mismatch issue... pretty strange though file an issue about that please  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Are you actually using cuda? If you're doing NLP it's slower 
solution: also, you hadn't mentioned dl4j, have you raised it's version to rc3.10 as well? it's important for neural nets, sicne there were implemented many optimization viable for both cuda and native stuff. 

issue: Oh so xeon phi work already? Is compiling with mkl very involved? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: is there any word on when 0.4-rc3.11 will be released? 
solution: We're currently benchmarking spark. it*. 

issue: can I load pdf data ? Word2Vec model contains textile -0.042775820940732956 -0.10344646871089935 -0.17570629715919495 0.03134290128946304 what it indicates? 
solution: 

issue: Hi everyone. I followed the Word2VecSentimentRNN example and applied a different dataset.Now I get the following message during Evaluation: "Warning: class 1 was never predicted by the model. This class was excluded from the average precision"What could be the cause? I guess there is something wrong with my dataset? 
solution: could be, but it's not the only possible explanation. Colud also be for example normalization or tuning issues. 

issue: Just to make this clear.The featuresMask has a 1 set for every word in the sequence, while the labelsMask has a [0,1] or [1,0] set  at the  index of the last word in the sequence. correct? 
solution: 

issue: for features: 1 for every word and 0 for any padding time steps for labels: 1 for where the class label occurs - i.e., index of last word 0 elsewhere that's masks 
solution: I've seen some sequence classification stuff where they just duplicate the label across multiple time steps. 

issue: I'm just getting started with deeplearning4j and would like to visualize weights and biases in a given neural network during forward/back prop.  I wonder if that exists, as I think a dynamic visual display of the network would be a great learning tool. Will take a look@raver119, thanks! All of the examples so far run for me, but when I add the following line for visualization I get an error.  What is best way to rectify?model.setListeners(new HistogramIterationListener(1));o.d.e.f.m.MLPMnistSingleLayerExample - Build model..../Users/jamesweaver/dl4j-0.4-examples/target/classes/dropwizard.yml has an error:Unrecognized field at: templateDid you mean?:\nserver\nmetrics\nuploadPath\nlogging AlexDBlack: Yes, it works now.  Very cool. 
solution: For a presentation that features dl4j I want to create a visualization that illustrates a neural network including its weights and biases as they are dynamically calculated.  The visualization will contain nodes and edges that represent the neural network's architecture, sort of like this image: https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2014/11/01/~/media/ECG/visualstudiomagazine/Images/2014/11/1114vsm_mccaffreyfig2.ashxMy initial investigation into relevant API classes and methods seems to indicate that I can iterate over the layers of a MultiLayerNetwork, but that obtaining individual weights in the nodes of a layer may not be as straightforward.  In addition, I see that there are listeners that may by suited for reporting this sort of information as it changes.  What approach would you suggest for programmatically obtaining all of the biases, weights, and node values in a given network?. 

issue: Guys, I would like to make a JavaRDD of a list of INDArray, but I get NullPointerException when I try to do anything -- let's say arrRDD.foreach(arr -> System.out.println(arr)); Is there a simple workaround? thank you! I guess the data buffers are not being serialized/copied and the pointers in the INDArrays refer to the local machine memory? 
solution: 

issue: instead of sentences would it be possible to work over descriptions? for example if I have a description of a credit card transaction that includes the company and the amount of money spent there, can i use a file containing all the transaction descriptions instead of sentences? would i have to have a separate vocabulary for financial terms? 
solution: 

issue: I want to run dl4j on a remote server where I cannot use IDE. Where can I find the appropriate information about setting up dl4j on a server.  (Server is not AWS) 
solution: 

issue: well, "possible" =/= easy currently@atollFPwill be doing some work/implementation for RL with DL4J starting soon as for CG: I don't believe there's equivalent methods that allow you to pass in external error, as is available in MLN open an issue and I can try to take a look at some point 
solution: 

issue: Hello, just a quick question.. i have a pb with INDArray.reshape that doesn't seem to work. i am sure dimensions match and also the example from [<-LINK->] doesn't work either.  Any ideas?

issue: Hey, so I am transitioning to 3.10 and I am getting this error.Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no jnind4j in java.library.pathI am quite sure its my fault but I did what was mentioned on the quickstart page. OS: Linux Ubuntu 12.04 output ofjava -version  [<-CODE->] any idea on what I am missing?

issue: hmm...I am getting:'dependencies.dependency.version' for org.nd4j:nd4j-native:jar:linux-x86_64 is missing. on using  [<-CODE->] oops. Looks like I did not read what you wrote carefully. wait. 
solution: You also need the version there. 

issue: Hi guys, I have created a program which is designed to recognize the classes in the cifar10 dataset.  I have downloaded the dataset and assembled it in a parent path structure, where the subdirectories represent the class labels.  Unfortunately, when training the net, it plateaus at a score of roughly 0.45 (about 10% accurate).  I think it is a problem with the way I am training the net.  Could someone take a look at my code and explain to me why this might be happening.  I am using Maven 3.0, Java 1.8.0_25, on a Windows 10, 64-bit computer.  Here is my code: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Does training paragraph vectors , outputs any model file , because I can't see any when I did ? 
solution: it contains all possible combination for reading/writing models. 

issue: By normalization u mean that the elements of each example used for training sum to 1, right? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: Could you tell me, what did you exactly mean in [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: When you dorecordReader.initialize(trainData, transform);Does the recordReader will contain the original data + the transformed data, or only the transformed data ? recordReader.initialize(trainData, transform);Does the recordReader will contain the original data and the transformed data, or only the transformed data ?

issue: Hi, I had a problem with Netbeans+Maven and dl4j version 0.4rc3.10, it compiler but at runtime I got this error:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: With Netbeans the execution fails, with Intellj IDEA, I get the same error but execution goes. My question is.. how do I check what backend is effectively using dl4j ? 
solution: 

issue: https://github.com/deeplearning4j/ComputerVision-examples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/cv/animals/AnimalsClassification.java@raver119 Where in that code do you guys normalize the datas of the image ? Using StandardScaler is still fine in rc3.10 ? 
solution: nd4j-native is cpu backend. it includes only itself.. on rc3.9 I used the StandardScaler object but it's this code example of rc3.10 I don't see any normalization. 

issue: Fellows, I am trying to choose a library for working with csvs in java (kotlin).  Any suggestions here?   Spark dataframes seem like the obvious choice . . .  I ask it here because it, along with DL4J, seems like another important part of the story for doing ML work in java. 
solution: jcarv: try MNIST!. 

issue: Hi, I'm here again :-), I'm going to launch a long training on a very large dataset :-) , I need a last confirm: In my tests, I'm not able to benefit of my multicore CPU during learning, during learning with my conv network, dl4j with 'native' backend always uses 1 core (1thread). Is there a way  (using  other backend or code tricks) to take advantage of multicore in order to speedup learning? AlexDBlack: I'm currentli building a list of DataSet, each dataset containing 20 rows (that I understood are examples) and I submit the DataSet list to the fit() method thru ListDataSetIterator. I have understood that every DataSet in the list is a minibatch. Am I right? currentli == currently 
solution: 

issue: @rikima deeplearning4j/dl4j-0.4-examples#118Will be this pull req merged?  I could not succeeded to run this example. 
solution: rikima: @eralywill be working on it. agibsonccc: I got it.. 

issue: I am getting  [<-CODE->] caused by the code: 
solution: well the rest of the stack is my code. That wont make sense to you. 

issue: is there any reason when using Updater.SGD why I would get wildly different results each time I predict() from the same feature vector? 
solution: 

issue: if I want to write individual vectors to an intermediate data file using CSVRecordWriter (or any RecordWriter), is there a utility function that can help with this? RecordWriter.write wants a Collection<Writable> not an NDArray don't worry -- found it 
solution: 

issue: saudet: Thank you, i don't know if im getting this right but does this mean the DataSetIterator calls the fetcher internally? And on the case of the MnistDataSetIterator it calls that specific fetcher? If i was reading a standard scv file, then the basefetcher would be used? 
solution: 

issue: OK, so next question about writing CSVs. I'm doing this (where listingVec is just a row vector, and outputWriter is a CSVRecordWriter): outputWriter.write(RecordConverter.toRecord(listingVec)) but the CSVs are all formatted to only 2 decimal places [0.51, -0.11, -0.32, -0.33, 0.01, 0.22] ... obvs. this isn't great as far as using them later goes ;-) how can I set the precision? can't find this anywhere in the docs oh, wtf... I tried SVMLightRecordWriter instead, and it still came out in CSV format maybe it's the RecordConverter's fault? well, that's what I'm getting... ok, 5 mins AlexDBlack: is scala ok? 
solution: andrewclegg:  [<-LINK->]. so yeah, recordConverter just wraps the INDArray. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] no reason for it to be limited to 2 decimal places  [<-LINK->] if it's a DoubleWritable, again, no reason for 2 dp give me something I can run locally to reproduce it? 
solution: 

issue: Umm. A little help needed here guys  [<-CODE->] I'm getting this when i'm trying to run iter.next() I've corrected the label count issue earlier. I found using recordReader.getLabels() has an extra label in the end But I'm still getting the exception. Any ideas? :-/ 
solution: 

issue: Can i get this dl4j-example through maven by any chance? I don't seem to have it in my current version of dl4j-examples........ 
solution: bewareofuser_twitter: git clone here [<-LINK->] then to get any updates "git pull". right, you need to do it another like for example@nyghtowlwas just talking about. 

issue: saudet: but correct if i'm wrong, the base fetcher does not do any normalization? 
solution: And i don\'t mean to be anoying, but if that is the case, the line on this tutorial [<-LINK->] , at least for me its misleading:"Typically, a DataSetIterator handles inputs and data-set-specific concerns like binarizing or normalization. For MNIST, the following does the trick:".

solution: 

issue: Hey guys, are there any known issues with the org.nd4j.linalg.api.ndarray.INDArray.putScalar(int i, double value) method? After I put a double the value in the INDArray is not the same as the double.  [<-LINK->] that's my code 
solution: which is the default setting for computational reasons. 

issue: In rc3.10 is Double the data representation by default ? because i have memory issues since 3.10 
solution: no, double has never been the default, ever. no changes to memory management or anything that should affect memory use in 3.9 to 3.10, that I can think of....

solution: neema99: try the csvExample in the DataExamples. 

issue: does nd4j have an idiomatic way to find the indices of the top n highest values in a vector? 
solution: yeah, saw that, was hoping for top n... no matter, can write something for it. 

issue: Hi. Are there any benchmarks on processing speed of word2vec in deeplearning4j vs tensorflow you are right i dont know if i did something wrong, but when i run the Word2VecRawTextExample it takes 14 minutes and if i run the raw_sentences.txt with mkl it takes 10 secounds i used the raw_sentences.txt file so a rather small training 
solution: ahhh. 

issue: I was in here [<-LINK->] and looks like the code could need some updating ? 
solution: if you see anything like that file an issue. but I suppose it's for beginner purposes ?. 

issue: agibsonccc: Adam, why do we need to work with the computation graph for the siameselike nets ? 
solution: Anytime you do something custom that isn't a feed forward op really. Google computation graph and read up a bit. 

issue: Dunno if anybody can help, but would this be the correct way of getting the generated values from network? And if it is, how would you go about iterating through an INDArray? [<-LINK->] It can produce classification or probabilites, will it in this case give me the generated values from the encoding part? Because i'm getting exactly the same values on each iteration, not sure if this is overfitting, poor configuration ou poor pre-processing... but that's on my side now I'm gonna look into that link, thank you

issue: Hi guys i'm struggling to install dl4j/nd4j on amazon's EMR. Is there any step-by-step tutorial on the quickest way to do so? I mean, what do I need to install in order to get dl4j running on my machines? Does ND4J require some installations besides the native libraries? or is including org.nd4j:nd4j-native:... enough? 
solution: 

issue: So I do not need to include netlib in my jar at all? It applies to 0.4-rc3.10 as well, right? 
solution: thoroughly. and then tried to use some examples.

solution: 

issue: there seems to be problems if you are using kryo serialization, and 300mb of csv usually shouldn't result in 100gb of ram usage are those 100gb acually used memory, or just java heap size?

issue: AlexDBlack: what if after initializing the layers, I assign the W and b parameters of the first layer to the other embeddinglayers? is it safe to do so (in terms of thread safety)? Can you elaborate a little bit more about theuglycustomization? 
solution: so if you want 2 shared layers, you'd have mergeAlongMinibatch(in1, in2) -> yourLayer -> splitAlongMinibatch (first half to out1, second half to out2).

solution: for the first question, I drilled as far as "return get(NDArrayIndex.point(r),NDArrayIndex.all())" in BaseNDArray.getRow and then the logic in get looked kinda complex... it looks like there are some cases that cause a copy and some that don\'t. 

issue: Hello everyone I had gone through using RNN doc where it talks about importing  time series but in lot of papers I had read about the data being encoded by sliding window etc.According to my understanding it is not a necessary step since RNN tries to find the sequence from the input.Am I correct on this 
solution: right, sliding windows are not necessary with RNNs (as a general rule). 

issue: Guys, If I run dl4j locally, is there any thing similar to MLUtils.fromLabeledPoint(...,batchSize) where you can partition the dataset into batches - but assuming i'm running dl4j locally? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: Is there any RecordReader that just takes a java/scala collection of DataSets or should I implement it? I'm trying to transform an Array[String] (comma-delim values) into DL4J compatible DataSetwith batchses. When using RecordReaderDataSetIterator, it is required to provide a RecordReader. Is there a RecordReader that just iterates over an existing collection? I know I can map my comma-delim-string to DataSets using RecordReaderFunction and CSVRecordReader, but then how do I use RecordReaderDataSetIterator when I have an Iterable[DataSet] ? 
solution: 

issue: So I'm trying to create a custom image pipeline that uses spark and I'm a little stuck. I want to have the vectorization of all my files be distributed; I'm thinking of using  wholeTextFiles() to create a PairRDD with <key,value> = <file path, contents of file as string>. From here is there any way I could get a canova recordreader to work with my PairRDD 
solution: 

issue: hey @AlexDBlack. For when you are around. I'm having a problem running an example with Cuda. Here is my pom.xml and the error I'm getting:http://pastebin.com/gtn2diHwhttp://pastebin.com/aF7uhDJBI should mention that it works perfect with nd4j-native switched on. Am I missing something? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: can you please explain more that what I should do? Now the only way that I have access to the result of word2vec is with giving one word as a string query to the methods like similarity and etc., how I can retrieve the whole vocabulary? thank you and please bear with me if my question is too  simple. 
solution: 

issue: i am trying to figure out the best way to run my code that I now run in intellij on an amazon ec2 machien machien machine ha i know there are a lot of options here, but i am just looking for something simple.  something that would be the equivalent of copying the jar manually and calling "java -jar" any suggestions? 
solution: 

issue: please, explain what you're doing, i still can't understand why you'd need to turn it on/off constantly. 
solution: 

issue: I have a column vector "col", and another (shorter) column vector "idxs" containing indexes, and I want to retrieve the elements in "col" that are at the locations pointed to by "idxs"... i.e. "fancy indexing" but I'm having a nightmare getting the syntax right I ran into this bug first: [<-ISSUE->] so then I tried to transpose them both and use them as row vectors, but no joy I can make an index like this: val rowIdxer = new NDArrayIndex(NDArrayUtil.toInts(idxs.transpose):_*) "rowIdxer: org.nd4j.linalg.indexing.NDArrayIndex = NDArrayIndex{indices=[1, 3, 5]}" which looks right but then if I do this: col.transpose.get(rowIdxer) I get the whole of col back, not just the indexed elements help! same if Idon'ttranspose idxs when creating the NDArrayIndex from it 
solution: 

issue: raver119: When I run the code the first time, the server starts. Then when I run it the second time, I get "java.lang.RuntimeException: java.net.BindException: Address already in use: bind" maybe because the instance in the port is still running

issue: and how does the plotting work ??! 
solution: 

issue: raver119: I've attached a gist of the issue I'm hitting with the broadcast function. I am trying to broadcast a 6x5 INDArray into a 3x6x5 INDArray but the resulting array gives me a shape of 6x6x5. I hope I am using the broadcast function correctly. [<-LINK->] raver119: do you have any recommendations for me with the broadcasting function? I can't seem to get it to work properly. eraly: yes broadcast is the op. I will try broadcast op as well and see if I can do what I want to do that way 
solution: 

issue: rahulpalamuttam: Post an issue with what you're running in to Broadcast shouldn't be difficult to use..bit confused here Can't look atm though

issue: dwhite4: did you pull this from the batch norm example in ComputerVision? If so those examples need tuning Its a work in progress in the midst of other activities and input is welcome For more in-depth tuning talk, check out the tuning  channel: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: nyghtowl: In other words, my issue is probably a matter of incorrect tuning and not incorrect logic?  I just want to make sure I am not simply misunderstanding how to use the DL4J functions.  As far as I can see, the rest of my code is correct, can anyone verify that my logic is correct and that there aren't any other mistakes that could be attributable to the problem besides tuning?  I have had success training a convolutional neural net on MNIST data, but CIFAR seems to be giving me issues.  Here is my code again: [<-LINK->] nyghtowl: Cool, I will experiment with the tuning a little on my own and be sure to post in the tuning channel some time tomorrow.

issue: vin101: of note here: That's a compilation error You shouldn't be ignoring that Make sure you're using an ide 
solution: 

issue: Hello again. Regarding RNNs for regression: in the documentation you refer some ways of importing the time series data to use it on the RNN, but you don't mention the simpliest case, which is when you have the input, the time series and the output all in the same file. This may seem basic but how would I import and use a file like this on an RNN? AlexDBlack: could you take a look at this please? Also, I can't seem to figure out how to extrapolate from the BasicRNNExample to the situation where I would have a CSV with sales data. 
solution: 

issue: andrewclegg: If I understand the paper that you linked correctly, they are proposing to simply use a bag of ngrams input with a single hidden layer and softmax classification... Nothing much to implement there from my understanding the hierarchical softmax is only useful if you havelotsof labels and yes, just a speed optimization as far as I understand it 
solution: 

issue: yeah, I think so -- plus feature hashing but that's pretty simple they use hierarchical SM tho -- is that in dl4j? IIRC it's used by the SequenceVectors learner or something? I guess that's just a speed optimization tho...? yeah, I was planning to use this for something a bit like the tag classification task from the paper 
solution: I have a simple bag of words based nn in production, that while about as good as the interns, could be a bit better. 

issue: Hi, am able to find find the vector of the words from sentence. can you directly find the vector of sentence ? to find the word2vec, I follow : [<-LINK->] my sentence is "He lives in Evora." and I got  lives -0.3491044044494629in -0.30449551343917847evora -0.33498069643974304he -0.41326963901519775 
solution: 

issue: sorry im still having the main class issue is there a folder of calsses i can navigate too and link as the main class actually no, this looks to be a bit more updated let me try that first 
solution: I have your examples, it just has less files in it. 

issue: All the models in the model zoo [<-LINK->] point to dead links, will there be fixes or can they be found somewhere else? 
solution: 

issue: ddsky: hi david - sorry for the misnomer. all we have are the preconfigured models. we know they learn well on the data, but we don't have prebuilt parameters for the time being. 
solution: and there might be probems. if they are NOT intersecting - which guarantee is YOUR task - you'll be fine then. 

issue: ddsky: I haven\'t run it on the full imagenet yet. What is your definition of a "standard desktop"? 
solution: 

issue: nyghtowl: I mean no multiple GPUs etc. my desktop ist 16gb ram, i7, one GPU with 2gb ram - I just wonder whether that would take hours, days, or weeks to train myself. I was sure somebody trained that already just like tensorflow's inception-3 model was already trained on imagenet 
solution: 

issue: stephanduq: yea but if I'm not missing anything here, the pom  is an alternative for downloading the APIs and importing them, it won't make you have a copy the whole project. let's take dl4j-examples for instance, to have the examples classes in your IDE without having to copy paste them on your own, could that be done with maven? 
solution: 

issue: Hey, I have build my own DataSet now. What is the best way to get mini batch learning with it? Is there already a class that I can use for that or do I have to code my own Fetcher/Iterator? Hey, I have build my own DataSet now. What is the best way to get mini batch learning with it? Is there already a class that I can use for that or do I have to code my own Fetcher/Iterator? 
solution: But I think that if you pass the dataset directly it only uses full batch learning, or am I wrong?. 

issue: Goldado: i’m not sure why exactly they failing for you, for me they are passing on both linux and windows, and i know that they are working, since that simple class is used in multiple other tests and examples so it would be really hard to miss, if that thing suddenly break :) i’ll check once again sure, but right now i’m fighting other test, that uses classpathresource itself, and it definitely working

issue: Hi everyone, I was looking for a linear least squares implementation provided by nd4j and I found this : [<-LINK->] is there another implementation I am missing out on? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, if I want to normalize my own raw data in dl4j, should I use thenext()method to getDataSetfrom Dataiterator to get the mini-batch data, and then usenormalizeZeroMeanZeroUnitVariancemethod to normalize the mini-batch data? Is there any way to normalize the whole data together? Thank you! raver119: 
solution: 

issue: Question about a dl4j use case:  After training a model, how does one run one example through for a prediction?  Sample code seem to be on training and testing a model, but I'm not seeing where a trained model is used to make a prediction on one example. 
solution: AdamJWong: check canova, it has recordreader suitable for wav files.

issue: sorry dude spent 6 hours the other day trying to get it to work in NetBeans just frustrated and trying to get it to work ill figur eit out on my own these chat windows are useless 
solution: 

issue: If you're having trouble troubleshooting that stuff, take the barebones tutorials the site gives you and follow those before trying it with dl4j, or better yet run through the sample and that side by side intellij has amazing docs unlike netbeans That's why I'm telling you to run through that stuff first

solution: JavaFXpert: nd4j-native. 

issue: For demo purposes, I'm trying to run the jl4j examples in CloudFoundry (on top of AWS), and the program prematurely exits when it uses the nd4j library [e.g. Nd4j.zeros(4, 2)]I'm reading about ND4J Backends [<-LINK->] but wanted to ask what a safe choice to try would be, given that I'm trying to run on top of  a cloud platform. raver119: Thanks, and congrats! 
solution: 

issue: but you do include nd4j-native as a dependency? Maybe Nd4j implementation discovery logic doesn't work well with uber jars? 
solution: 

issue: FelixVoelker: I don' t remember regression ever being broken? I'm not sure how new you are to ML, but you have to TUNE a neural net Instability CAN happen Problem between chair and keyboard there ;) Have you saw our regression examples there? You'll need to give us more information about what you've tried, but it's not the lib

issue: This line is not any more in the latest pom.xml <nd4j.backend>nd4j-native</nd4j.backend> How to select GPU for training now? 
solution: 

issue: In one of my models I get F1 score of 0.6. I just tried removing the hidden layer, and I still get exact same F1 score of 0.6. What can explain this? This is classification problem, and by removing the hidden layer it just performs logistic regression as far as I understand. 
solution: 

issue: jfolt: Add deeplearning4j-cuda-7.5 as dependency, and it will use cuDNN (or you'll get a warning if it doesn't) 
solution: 

issue: cuDNN dlls are in the same folder as CUDA ("c:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v7.5\\bin"), so it is on path. And training with Cuda works. I added issue: [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: ThePrecisionand theRecallin this picture is not right, isn't it? 
solution: 

issue: I recently updated to version 0.4.0 and now I'm getting the no jnind4j in java.library.path error. But I can't seem to fix it with the tips from the quickstart. My code and all the examples were working fine with rc10. Okay, I did try it again. Cloned the examples repo, ran mvn clean install and tried to run the MLPLinearClassifier with IntelliJ. Still the same error. I also cleaned up my .m2 folder as well as my Temp folderr. 
solution: and to double check that it is in fact the version that is causing the problem: can you do the following on your examples directory, and try again?git checkout c2bd75a1cec2673c4488fffee39edf25c6d0edf8that'll give you an older version of the examples with 3.10. 

issue: The example of  StackedAutoEncoderMnistExample is using labeled data to tune.  if I don’t have that much of label data, can I train the stacked autoencorder with unlabeled data and use some of the labeled to tune? 
solution: 

issue: I've updated to 0.4.0 and appear to be having the same issue as Timo Nolle ( jnind4j.dll: Can't find dependent libraries ) Running Dependency Walker on jnind4j.dll in the javacpp temp dir Says that MKL_RT.DLL is a dependancy which cannot be found. (it's true that it is not on my system) I'm using Windows 7 We'll probably wait for the update.  Thanks for verifying the issue.

issue: raver119: just following up to see if you received my reply yesterday about the nd4j related problem when running in Cloud Foundry on AWS raver119: AFIACT there are no exceptions being thrown.  There are raver119: no stacktraces 
solution: will be glad to help you when you get something there. 

issue: I\'m getting a exception, when using 0.4.0 with the cuda backend. I just tested it with the official examples (MLPClassifierMoon).The exception also exception occurs if I just call "Nd4j.zeros(10)" as first instruction in the Main Method. With the last version (rc3.10) everything worked with cuda.The exception: [<-LINK->] raver119: Strange thing: reinstalling the Cuda Toolkit helped...

solution: 

issue: I'm having the same problem with@saurabhgith tried with both intellij/eclipse 
solution: 

issue: apoliaki: do your own research. we don't know nearly as much about our competitors as we do about our own framework, so we can't be really objective. DL4J is the most widely used open-source deep-learning tool for the JVM, so maybe that says something. 
solution: apoliaki: adding to that - we're happy to look at comparisons from 3rd parties. 

issue: Can I run it without the web stuff? 
solution: I don't use it right now, and I also removed the ArbiterUIServer: [<-CODE->]. right, that should be all you need. 

issue: ok, that's a bug with arbiter, shouldn't be starting the UI server but is even without the UI listeneranyway, best workaround I can provide for now is to add the following two lines to /resources/dropwizard.yml:template: Hello, %s!defaultName: DL4J-Examples I assume you are running the examples? or is this your own project? 
solution: 

issue: Should I copy the one in arbiter jar to my application resources folder, or just fresh file with these lines? 
solution: 

issue: not sure where to best ask this question - but does ND4J do parallel execution based on the number of cores by default? I keep running into Java OOM errors - can't allocate more native threads I definitely will but am i observing this correctly? Cause im doing nd4j ops in spark - and if nd4j's linalg ops are being done in parallel - each of my spark threads are trying to launch more threads?

issue: Hi, what should I do if adding \'-Djava.library.path=""\' does not fix the no jnind4j error on windows with 64-bit JDK? raver119: perfect the solution at the end worked.  Thanks a bunch! 
solution: 

issue: Does upgrading from 0.4-rc10 to 0.4.0 require adding further dependencies in pom.xml? Code working fine with 0.4-rc10 won't start, with the UnsatisfiedLinkError: jnind4j.dll: Can't find dependent libraries. This with using nd4j-native on windows. I'm trying to upgrade because there seems to be a bug in loading Word2Vec models in 0.4-rc10 that seems to be fixed in git now. That's it, thank you very much

issue: Hi all are there any constants in DL4J for the names of activation functions? I tried searching the source code, but only found magic strings like "tanh" and "softmax", etc. ... no constants. raver119: that's a JavaDoc, not constants I was rather looking for something like Activation.SOFTMAX, Activation.TANH 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys, I got this error: [<-ISSUE->] with a Windows 64 bit JVM.. 
solution: 

issue: can we use cuda 7.0 or 6.5 with dl4j? or is 7.5 the bare minimum. 
solution: there's solution proposed. I remember there was a discussion on this, so what is better dl4j + mkl or dl4j + openblas. 

issue: chrisvnicholson: I had looked at TestOptimizers.java, but it does not mix a custom estimator with a MultiLayerNetwork.    MultiLayerNetwork seems to be limited to the optimizers in Solver.getOptimizer(. eraly: If I file the issue, I won't mention that I was put up to it.  In the mean time I think I may try wedging it in by overriding BaseOutputLayer in a strong-armed fashion. 
solution: 

issue: MKL is faster, but by how much depends a lot on the what's being computed...

issue: Hey there, um your page on the Iris example ( [<-LINK->] ), the code in the big block does not match the code as you go line by line, so the tutorial doesn't really make sense 
solution: 

issue: jmoney4769: thanks for pointing that out. we're steering people away from the iris example now, since the iris data set is too small to produce stable results. we have a couple more examples on the way.

solution:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Mask arrays indicates if data is present (1) at that time step for that example, or 0 if data is just padding. I think that my labelsMask should be "null"? 
solution: so, you will have a mask array with a lot of zeros and a single 1 at the end. 

issue: ok, I  have a 3 dimension array (i.e. 30x30x1000) and I want to get a subarray 30x30x300 (let's say the first 300). I am using the ndarray.subbarray(offset,shape, stride), where offset = {0,0,0}, shape = {30,30,300}, stride {1,1,1}. Still I am not getting the result I am expecting. Am I using the incorrect method or am I missing something in my linear algebra calculations (possibly the stride...)? 
solution: I would be using INDArray.get (see [<-LINK->] ...)) for that.

issue: I see in nvidia-smi that Volatile GPU Utilization is 10% Does this mean that deeplearning4j only uses 10% of available GPU resources? How can I increase the load? between batches there is some CPU time involved that will dilute the load anyway. Does DL4j do something like parallel batches? Is it even feasible? I have enough data, will try increasing batch size 
solution: 

issue: akhodakivskiy: actually that should be extended to gpu usecase somehow too... with pascal generation everyone and their grandma's will have 8gb of gpu ram initially i was going to use asyncdatasetiterator for that though with just larger prefetchSize but static cache on gpu might definitely work for some usecases

issue: Hey, I train a ConvNet with WordVectors. It goes well but after the 16 epoch I get an error:https://gist.github.com/astier/af15a99810e8223c01eb9002f0760be0OS: Linux Mint 18 64Bitnd4j-/dl4j-version: 4.0 
solution: 

issue: I have some problem while running example in linux : Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unexpected state occurred for AsyncDataSetIterator: runnable died or no data available sometimes it happens ,but sometimes it runs perfectly. 
solution: huwenshayu: I believe that has been fixed here: [<-ISSUE->]. for now, you can use "while(iter.hasNext()) myNet.fit(iter.next())" instead of fit(DataSetIterator). 

issue: I think, If I go to the folder where my pom.xml exist and type "maven clean install" would do the work? 
solution: It's not our job to step you through every minute detail. 

issue: s0taka: had a look through your gist, can't see any obvious issues there. data and mask arrays seem to be okso it could be a tuning issue, perhaps yeah, shouldn't have any issue with non-square filters just define width/height in network config as normal 
solution: 

issue: Ok, thank you. I'm running the code on my laptop right now and therefore can't feed the network with enough examples. Might work if I try it on a different machine.

issue: So I'm new to LSTMs, but they seem like they might be perfect for what I'm trying to do. It's noted in the guide that LSTMs can map many sequential inputs to one output, which is exactly what I need, but I don't think I understand how that would work. Could anyone explain that concept a little further or link me to resources on it? 
solution: 

issue: basically the RNN consumes inputs one at a time and updates its hidden state (oh and i almost forgot, the DL4J docs on RNNs are actually very good: [<-LINK->] ) 
solution: turambar: indeed they are. I think Alex wrote them.. 

issue: Good morning, another newbie question: Given a dataset with x,y values. How would you normalize this using the framework? Or should we be normalizing our data before using the framework?The regression samples RegressionMathFunctions.java and RegressionSum.java seem to give themselves pre-normalized data. 
solution: use NormalizerMinMaxScaler or NormalizerStandardize. 

issue: are you using dropout? afaik that doesn't properly use seeds atm (was recently changed to a c++ op for performance reasons) 
solution: 

issue: gks141270: i hope you're using maven? 
solution: Yes. 

issue: Can I send you pom.xml through this chat? 
solution: 

issue: I have modified the "RegressionSum.java" example to try and fit a straight line through points from a csv file.  I run into the exact same error as this issue: deeplearning4j/dl4j-0.4-examples#126 .Is this something I need to wait for?My code here:https://gist.github.com/AltASoftware/724b270198bd2019ef0f46184f9ac415 Or have I simply messed up? Thank you. 
solution:

issue: Hey guys, I\'m having a bit of an issue. As a simple test, I just wanted to modify the two layer MNIST example a bit by manually uploading the dataset and labels. I used the Image Pipeline tutorial as a guideline, as well as a few examples online. Here is my code, as well as the "Index Out of Bounds" error I\'ve been receiving. Any help would be sincerely appreciated!: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: AlexExplorer: you're getting this error because of .bash_profile but your env vars to .profile instead that matters. put it there, relogin, and you'll be fine devarajphukan: show your pom.xml please  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: That would be a bit complicated mainly because of libnd4j Wecanbut haven't gotten around to it I'm working on docker automation atm  [<-LINK->] Go through the readme Everything else is just mvn clean install 
solution: Yeah, linbd4j is built already. I was hoping that there is a script that will do git pull; mvn clean install for all the projects :P. 

issue: don't worry. you can't break dl4j/nd4j etc master without us reviewing and manually merging a PR :) 
solution: 

issue: I got it. So dl4j implemented similar thing like caffe to use c++ codes(nd4j 's backend can also blas/cuda) and will implemented similar thing like theano or tensorflow to support symplic diff or auto diff? 
solution: Aside: I think the dual encoding LSTM wouldn't be too hard to implement in DL4J. You just need a custom loss function. But the rest of the arch is just an LSTM..

issue: saudet: I found that programs running on ND4J 0.4.0 works very slow, but on 0.4-rc-1.0 it is fine. So maybe that is caused by the same reason you mentioned? saudet: So now, the nd4j (0.4.0) is based on another lib? Following your view, I think the simple way to accelerate the processing is to link with MKL . Is that right? 
solution: saudet: But how to use it in the program? I cannot find any info about it in the pom.xml file of the dl4j examples.. 

issue: AlexDBlack: I am talking about the different number of training examples. Foe example, for task1 I have 1000 training examples, for task2 500, for task3 250 and so on... In DL4J examples for multi task it was shown that the number of labels is the same for both tasks, but what to do if I have the different number of labels for each task? Also, multi task learning is supposed to produce the more accurate prediction results compared to the single task, but with DL4J I got the much worse. Have anyone tried to do multitask modeling? 
solution: 

issue: I noticed my old word2vec files stopped working, so I made some new ones,  using the writeFullModel function. But it seems the only thing it stores are the vectors, not the words? and loadFullModel also can't load the file the fitted model in the memory works fine, it seems saving it is where the problem is. Should I use writeFullModel, or should I save it in a different way?

How to iterate throughMultiLayerNetwork. I understand what in the loop I get a new file with model, but how to feed it intoMultiLayerNetwork? Ok. In theMultiLayerNetwork network = ModelSerializer.restoreMultiLayerNetwork(File);I createnetworkwith my Net configuration, right? But when I upload 600 models,  I have to have 600networkvariables. Is any way to get around it? Well, I have not said what it is you fault. I just ask is any way around ... 
solution: 

issue: Sure. I want to send thousands examples (feature vectors) to get prediction from 600 models.

issue: AlexDBlack: , I created a CVS reader for TimeSeries. And I created label file for each data file, as you mentioned: "myLabel0 contains a single number for the class". But it claims: "Input and label time series have different lengths: 30 input length, 1 label length". I.e. it wants label per each row, but it is confusing since the whole time sequence of 30 rows  represents label/digit in my case.

solution: 

issue: Hi, our team uses the deeplearning4j for CNN with Apache Spark. We meet a bug of [<-ISSUE->] . Can you fix the issue? 
solution: jcooky: That's not related to dl4j - that means you had a network error when download.

solution: that\'s called "uber jar". google that. 

issue: raver119: Noise is just another example of a nonsense variable that it should be ignored. It doesn’t require ‘magic’ to learn to ignore a nonsense variable, it’s the easiest thing in the world and neural nets have done it for decades (weka, for example, handles it just fine). I’m not saying it’s a major bug, but it is a bug, and it is detrimental to the development and experimentation process because it causes DL4J to break for no reason and gives no indication of the cause. These things are very difficult to debug.

issue: I am looking for help with word2vec and RDD. Anyone wants to help? raver119: I am having difficulties transforming my DataFrame to the sentence iterator ... raver119: exactly, but I have a Parquet file ... 
solution: 

issue: romusters: what’s up there? dl4j w2v supposes that data is coming from either file or hdfs actually vocab is built from those 
solution: 

issue: raver119: can't figure how to wrap a map<label, text> into an Iterable<LabelledDocument> to insert into paravec. do you have a short example? 
solution: grab label and text from your db. 

issue: I'm trying to add my own custom layer (java class), but it seems its not possible w/o forking the whole dl4j, or have I missed something? I've extended my conf class for layers, but when the network is being built, it looks like the factory is a bunch of if/else statements - and I'm not able to pass my own factory as well

issue: hi all, I have using NormalizerMinMaxScaler object to normalize my dataset but whenever after i invoke .transform method it's transform the dataset into 0 0,1,3232235777,1456888991,1456889891 input before transform 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00 after transform i referring on this example [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] agibsonccc: @raver119I have a question, is the sparkNetwork, generated above serializable? Can i pass it as the model, to a function inside an RDD ? i ask so because if i am doing so, i am getting Serialization Error 
solution: since you can easily create one youself anywhere. 

issue: raver119: So what is happening is that i train an RDD inside a method, which returns the model. Then i take the model and individually go inside each vector in the RDD and transform it to lower dimension . I do it using map. Thus for this reason, the model has to be serialized by the driver before passing it to the worker.

issue: Seems like Canova has some support but not really, as of December. Anyone know if progress has been made since? 
solution: Canova has been renamed DataVec recently. Lots of progress has been made since December.... 

issue: Hi, I want to use deep networks for image super resolution. But I can't find any examples with deeplearning 4j for it. How construct output layer with 2D output array?

issue: hi, I add a histogram iteration listener using the following code:MultiLayerNetwork model = new MultiLayerNetwork(conf);model.init();model.setListeners(new HistogramIterationListener(1));here is the output of console:D:\\dl4j-0.4-examples-master\\target\\classes\\dropwizard.yml has an error:Unrecognized field at: templateDid you mean?:\nmetrics\nserver\nuploadPath\nloggingwhat should I do? Thanks for your attention. 
solution: 

issue: saudet: , I have done that. I added all entries one by one and all together also. but no luck. Saudet, I have observed that it shows error in msvcrt.dll. It does not copy msvcrt.dll in javacppXXX temp folder. 
solution: msvcrt.dll is a system file, it's always there, you can ignore errors related to that. 

issue: So... you are trying to use cuda? Ok, so I should probably read the log gks141270: I can't seem to find a pom file in the log, have you shared a gist of it yet? 
solution: Paul, I haven't share pom.xml yet. Let me share it.. 

issue: HI I am testing the CNN example (MinistExample), but I always get the exception java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Cannot allocate 136389554 + 1209830400 bytes (> Pointer.maxBytes). Is it possible for me to change the max bytes of pointer? I think the Xmx value is only related to the max memory used for JVM, and the maxBytes of pointer is another thing. I will try it. 
solution: zhuangxududu: the native backend still respects the -Xmx value. 

issue: hello i'm using mlp with dropout as a regulasation function and i need to extract the outputs mlp of dropout before it combine them can anyone tell me if it is possible and how can i do it AlexDBlack: so i can't have the mlps( with desactiving some nodes) of dropout before combinig them 
solution: i need it to add some rules to optimise my prediction it's a new approach that i want to relize it ,it's originale never treated before so i wanna know if it's possible practiclly. 

issue: Hello, I edited [<-ISSUE->] with some updates, I'm having problems in training with spark even with the examples in dl4j-spark-cdh5-examples. Maybe it's some kind of Spark configuration that I'm missing? AlexDBlack: ok thanks, I have time to dedicate to this, and I really need to make spark+dl4j work properly on my environment, anything I can do? some further tests? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, is there any easy way to get an array out of an INDArray? what function gives the copy? can't seem to find it in the docs 
solution: 

issue: No is this medical? Or..? 
solution: That sounds like it'd be useful. Hmmm, that could maybe work, though I am working for a company right now, so I'll have to ask my supervisor for that. 

issue: Hi, I've got bugs of java.lang.IllegalStateException: Mis matched shapesat org.nd4j.linalg.util.LinAlgExceptions.assertSameLength(LinAlgExceptions.java:38)at org.nd4j.linalg.api.ops.BaseTransformOp.<init>(BaseTransformOp.java:47)at org.nd4j.linalg.api.ops.impl.transforms.Set.<init>(Set.java:25)at org.nd4j.linalg.api.ndarray.BaseNDArray.assign(BaseNDArray.java:1097)at org.nd4j.linalg.api.ndarray.BaseNDArray.put(BaseNDArray.java:1787)at org.nd4j.linalg.api.ndarray.BaseNDArray.putRow(BaseNDArray.java:3224) when I load the saved MultiLayerNetwork for testing. But no error occurs if I do the test immediately instead of saving and reloading it. I save the model by File tempFile = new File("model"); ModelSerializer.writeModel(net, tempFile, true); And load the model by MultiLayerNetwork net = ModelSerializer.restoreMultiLayerNetwork(model); 
solution: 

issue: Paul, In first commdn "mvn package", the error was a missing <version> entry in dependency of nd4j. I added that entry and first command worked. But second command ("java -cp") does not work What is the URL for fork? 
solution: 

issue: ok so I have this 1, 2, ..., 25 sequence I trained my RNN on. when I input 0, it outputs 1 and then I use that output as the next input to rnnTimeStep. this gives good results up until 25, but after that, quite bad ones. is this just a tuning issue or am I using the RNN wrongly? 
solution: 

issue: pedrofale: so if your inputs are of varying length and you have masks then the current state version of the normalizer will not account for that. The master branch has this functionality now and so will the next release. *current stable not state. Duh auto correct 
solution: 

issue: guys, I'm doing some testing about the spark bug i'm facing. I just found out that if I do not specify any of --executor-memory or --driver-memory (so spark uses 1g per executor), the training works fine. Can this mean that dl4j needs a lot of memory for itself even in training with spark? 
solution: It will cause a lot less gc churn. 

issue: I don't know about that, but right now i'm running the code that was causing problems in a 7x6g cluster and I had to give 2g to the driver and 2g to the executors. It's working smoothly. By the end of the day I can have some better results with bigger datasets and different amount of memory to Spark and i'll make a note in the issue. it's trange to me that dl4j uses memory outside the one I assign to the executors processes but xmx in spark is set with --executor-memory and if i assign all the memory of the node to that it crashes 
solution: It\'s more just like: "Oh I\'m running something besides an sql query in spark". spark has horrid scaling problems without a lot of tuning from us (and we STILL see stuff). 

issue: Hi, I wondered: is there a function for the tensor product (or dyadic product, or outer product, cf here: [<-LINK->] ) with nd4j ? otherwise I could do it line by line I mean the outer product between two matrices, not vectors 
solution: 

issue: see here for solution: [<-ISSUE->] clone the example repository that is linked there, and try again 
solution: 

issue: Finally got around to running dl4j on my new (and very cheap 970) So much faster. GPU usage is at 70 % CPU at 50% working perfectly. :-) 
solution: 

issue: Hi, when using ExistingMiniBatchDataSetIterator, is there any way to divide the data into training and validation? 
solution: 

issue: So the mnist images are of a certain size and the flower pictures are all different sizes. And so they would have to be resized first. Then you would have to pick the right filter etc etc. You could get nans for all sorts of reasons. Try scrolling through the tuning help channel also.  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Hi, can dl4j make predictions for only one testing instance? Two or more testing instances are ok, but only one instance will cause mis matched shape error. I use a MultiLayerNetwork (2 layer LSTM with softmax as classifier) to distinguish between human sound and noise. After training the model I use different sizes of testing instances. It is ok when testing size is 2/3/4..., but mis match error when only one test 
solution: 

issue: saudet: oh, didn't know that you could work with DICOM through ImageJ, but after a little googling, it seems like dcm4che 3 is a lot easier to use (could be because I've used it in my project), though there is almost no documentation on how it works, so it's a lot of trial and error with dcm4che Didn't get any answer when I asked last night, so I'll try again.When using ExistingMiniBatchDataSetIterator, is there any way to divide the data into training and validation? 
solution: 

issue: hey guys, got a problem while importing the examples in intellij, cloned them but after importing in intellij I get a git problem "can\'t start git: git.exe" the path is probably wrong, on win10, can\'t find it in my folders I have it as I cloned it from git shell 
solution: in indellij settings set git path then. 

issue: Hi, sorry for this question that is maybe stupid, but I am trying to copy the weights of a network every T iterations of a loop, is it OK if I just do net1 = net2, or should I use clone() ? 
solution: 

issue: I just found the "update" function, that seems to copy both weights and updaters, maybe this could work ? net1.update(net2) 
solution: I want to do reinforcement learning with target network, so I do not need to store networks on the hard disk, I just need two networks in memory and sometimes I make one be like the other. 

issue: Is this up to date? I'm not seeing a 'getFirst()' method on DataSet: [<-LINK->] if not, how does one access individual input rows from a DataSet? or iterate over them? 
solution: dataset contains features and labels. optional features mask and labels mask. dataset.getFeaturesMatrix. also, eval use is covered in our examples. 

issue: AlexDBlack: Found this issue; [<-ISSUE->] ; that's exactly what I was attempting to solve using DataAnalysis. Will wait for a fix

solution: and it shows medescription: 3D controllerproduct: GF117M [GeForce 610M/710M/810M/820M / GT 620M/625M/630M/720M]vendor: NVIDIA Corporation. 

issue: Hi! I'm newer in dl4j. Tried to run examples with http://deeplearning4j.org/quickstart, but in all example app's I've got an exception like this:Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: ..\\Temp\\javacpp7740422829691\\jnind4j.dll: Can't find dependent libraries.Looks like there are missing dll's for C++ code inside dl4j. How can I fix that? Sorry. I had to scroll down to Troubleshooting. It's common problem( 
solution: 

issue: eraly: - I see that it can't be used to fit 3d DataSetIterator, but it looks like it can used to transform 3d slices. 
solution: And the result is all 1s - that is subRowVector and divRowVector correctly handle 3d / 1d case. So 3d slice is 2d so that works fine.. So the real issue is handling masks for timeseries properly.. 

issue: hi guys I have question How can I skip a feature from DataSet object in DL4J? How can I remove this feature from my original data set instance after reading from the csv file? in the iterator? 
solution: well, parsing a CSV and removing a column manually isn't exactly difficult to do manually... probably < 10 lines of code. 

issue: Hi, I would like to build a complex NN just like this example [<-LINK->] However, I am not sure how the dataset iterator should be constructedDoes anyone have experience working on that matter? ops my apology, just found that I should be implementing the multiDataSet iterator interface 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: I've seen the issue [<-ISSUE->] and I'll wait for the next release and try. Thank you sooooooo much! 
solution: next should be out very soon - being prepared as we speak. 

issue: Hi there, I have a problem to get the 0.4.1-SNAPSHOT version. No problem to get the stable version 0.4.0. Snapshot repository is set up as well. [<-CODE->] Is something missing? Alright, thanks for the info. Is there a date when 0.4.1 becomes stable? 
solution: 

issue: My program compiles and runs, but when I try to make it into a jar, java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no jnind4j in java.library.path. I got it to work under 0.4-rc3.6. Whats going on and what can be done about it? 
solution: No luck. posted an issue with full error and pom.xml [<-ISSUE->]. 

issue: GrtAndPwrflTrtl: try cloning my fork (also mentioned in that issue) and see if that works, if it does start from there you'll have to simply clone my repository and try to run the examples from there 
solution: 

issue: Im looking to implement [<-LINK->] in deeplearning4j which is in essence a bidirectional-lstm + crf. I was able to see lstm implementations but not linear chain CRF. Is it possible to build such a network using deeplearning 4j ? 
solution: 

issue: QA as in questions and answers or quality assurance? 
solution: presumably it's not pulling in javacpp as a transitive dependency, when it should be. 

issue: yuanzhenjie: POM project:imageNet-Example.The <dl4j.version>0.4.1-SNAPSHOT</dl4j.version> version of the dl4j package can not be found; It can be replaced by 0.4-rc3.10?There is no big difference between the two versions, right?

solution: 

issue: raver119: Hello. You helped me with this issue over the weekend: [<-ISSUE->] Tried following your workaround. 
solution: so as long as you're using it - you should be fine, just import that class.

issue: raver119: i have an INDArray : data -->  shape (1000,2225) and INDArray: labels --> shape (1000,1)when i do model.fit(data,labels)I get (java.lang.IllegalStateException: Mis matched shapes) however, I pass in 2225 as input nodes and 2 as output nodes in my model. Quite odd...Also my system is able to train and predict properly when i do model.fit(data)So I dont understand why the spark version of it wouldn't work raver119: I have identified the problem for both systems to originate from adding labels when fitting the model. When I add labels in the form of Array[Int] and when I input an RDD[LabeledPoint] using SparkMultiLayer this corrupts the model.Any ideas for why this would happen? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: I used the standard example's pom.xml to start my project as you suggested yesterday. The jar now runs in linux, which is my final target enviornment, but not in windows. This is an improvement(thank you btw), but still would like it to run on windows too. Also, my linux test machine has CUDA installed so I don't know how to verify it's not using CUDA. Windows test pc was the one with no CUDA installed.

issue: Hi, All. I tried to utilize CUDA-7.5 to burst my "Word2VecRawTextExample" run performance, but program is stuck after printing "Starting learning process...". The example works well with "nd4j-native". I installed CUDA-7.5 well with my GTX950 on Linux and could run nvcc. Is there any way to use my GPU? raver119: got it! Thx for the fast response! 
solution: 

issue: Hi all, I am using 0.4.0, I have tried MNIST data set example and it worked. Then I tried to copy the neural network configuration, and substitute it with my own dataset (all .bmp files) using "ImageRecordReader".When I use opencv based "NativeImageLoader", it gives an exception "java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no opencv_imgproc310 in java.library.path", but when I switch to imageio loader, the dimension of parsed data seems to be wrong, anyone had the same problem? saudet: Thanks, opencv loader worked by adding the dependency for my platform (windows). 
solution: 

issue: raver119: Hi, I don't mean to rush you or anything, just wondering if you have made any progress on my GPU issues <.<? raver119: ooooh! can't wait ^^! 
solution: It also melts your gpu. 

issue: Jydago: hypothetically - yes. I can't confirm your issue, since after 0.4.0 there were huge changes, but we got fixed issue with exactly the same CUDA error code. lks21c: unfortunately, dl4j w2v impl can't use CUDA efficiently at this moment, implementation is suited for CPUs. Though, we have CUDA version for skipgram/cbow in our roadmap Jydago: sure Jydago: +- now dl4j-ui deeplearning4j-ui 
solution: 

issue: All right, will the fixes come in the next version? heh, so then my question is, when is the new version going to be released ^^?

solution: also, please use link i've posted in future :). 

issue: garam0419: if I understand your diagram correctly, that should be possible with ComputationGraph + MultiDataSetIteratorinput to the embedding layers is an integer value for the index; everything else is pretty standard there 
solution: also unit tests, and there's a version of the rnn character example (not using input size stuff). no, just one inputtype for each input, in same order they are defined in addInputs. 

issue: I saw the warning... However, I want to get it working. I'd be happy to PR a fixed version to you, but at the moment, the nIns seem to not be calculated properly. At least that's the impression I got from debugging this error message: [<-LINK->] Or am I wrong with that? The scala code of@antikantianspecifies the nIns manually for every layer... Do you have an idea why the nIns aren't calculated properly? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, there is a problem when using this scaler [<-LINK->] .

issue: danielr2e: : what loss function are you using? i\'ve done some work (in research, not using DL4J) on RNNs with regression outputs and have several friends who\'ve done more. The "word on the street" is that the standard linear regression loss (squared error) does not work especially well 
solution: 

issue: turambar: - thanks for the tip! Unfortunately, looks like the various configs I have used employ MCXENT (cross entropy?) and Negative Log Likelihood - all yield the same converge to 0.0 predictions result 
solution: raver119: it does not recognize org.deeplearning4j for some reason. 

issue: turambar: anything else stick out here as a no-no for continuous prediction?  [<-CODE->] 
solution: also, what is the distribution of your targets? Do you have a large number of small (close to zero targets), such that the model can get a really small loss by just predicting zero?. 

issue: And how do I get from my JavaRDD<List<Writable>> to Iterable[Pair[INDArray,INDArray]] ? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I just installed a CUDA compatible GPU and configured my project to use it. I don't see any performance gain during training, is that normal? 
solution: During training, I see some debug output about CUDA caching so I assume it is correctly using it. Starting with the GeForce GTX 750 Ti, this is NVIDIA’s flagship GM107 product. GTX 750 Ti packs a complete GM107 implementation, comprising 5 SMMs, 640 CUDA cores, 16 ROPs, and 40 texture units, and fed by 2MB of L2 cache. In terms of design GM107 is a clear successor to GK107, as evidenced by use of just 16 ROPs.. 

issue: 0.5.0 is out? Intellij seems to get pretty pissed off when i use it on the default examples in cpu mode changing it to gpu or reverting nd4j.version, dl4j.version, datavec.version, and arbiter.version all to 0.4.0 makes it go away "Failed to read artifact descriptor for org.nd4j:nd4j-native-platform:jar:0.5.0" 
solution: 

issue: raver119: Good morning! Has there been any progress on my GPU issue? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: updated to 0.5.0 and this \'        Pair<Gradient, INDArray> backpropGradient = trainingNN.backpropGradient(errorBatch);log.debug("test2");        trainingNN.getUpdater().update(trainingNN, backpropGradient.getFirst(), 1, batchSize);\' does not work any more ah sorry bad format. second call with manual update doesnt work any idea why? 
solution: 

issue: no, method know, seems to throw some internal exception, im executing it within a completable future so i dont see the error message in the debugger right now method known will open an issue. I guess i can try switching to computation graphs now where you provide a way to feed manual losses so with SGD it works, RMSProp fails 
solution: actually, try calling initGradientsView() after creating your network. 

issue: publicly? not that I'm aware of what's the use case here though? if you are submitting to an existing cluster, uber jar + spark submit should be all you need 
solution: i want to be able to just run a spark instance when ever needed to test things, that would be most comfortable with a docker, that i can just boot up when needed. 

issue: Hey guys, I'm still struggling with the GoogLeNet with the computation graph. In order to work around the issue found yesterday (nIns not calculated properly), I specified the nIns manually. However, now my dataset iterator does not seam to work. As the documentation states ( [<-LINK->] ), it should be possible to use a normal DataSetIterator when there is only one input and one output (which is the case atm). I did not change the DataSetIterator implementation and it worked with a MultilayeredNetwork before. However, with the ComputationGraph I get the following error when I call train(). [<-LINK->] what do I need to change? Is there a Documentation on it? Do I need to switch to the MultiDataSetIterator? Version is 0.5.0 (but it was the same with 0.4.0 
solution: 

issue: hello, I met a issue like this when fitting my network on spark clusters. 
solution: 

issue: I still get the missmatch error (although I now have the correct number of outputs specified). This is the error message [<-LINK->] do you have an idea what I'm doing wrong? 
solution: possibly a mix of 2d (feedforward) and 4d (image/cnn) activations or something. 

issue: Is canova no longer a part of dl4j per the latest update? What's up with that? Can't import it anymore. 
solution: DataVec. use that instead. it's like Canova on steroids. 

issue: I have a model that I built a while back using "0.4-rc3.8" I would like to update to using "0.4.0" but I was usingorg.nd4j.linalg.cpu.NDArray and I can't figure out where it (or its replacement) is in 0.4.0 I was having trouble finding some of the artifacts for 0.5.0 also, I wanted to create array explicitly, isn't INDArray just the interface ? 
solution: 

issue: what does it mean when the ScoreIterationListener returns NaNs ? 
solution: dan-lind: that training goes wrong.. dan-lind: yes, that's one of possible issues. other one - mistake at data feeding. many possible reasons.. 

issue: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.nd4j.nativeblas.NativeOps.enableP2P(Z)V  is a message i am getting its like the munging isn't being understood

issue: it didnt install the samples, making me thing the installer actually failed to work right checking to see if thats the problem 
solution: 

issue: regarding CUDA, i installed it and re-ran doc2vec. the CUDA code seemed to kick in, but the code ran extremely slow. i did a jstat and there was constant full GC collection even with a 2GB heap. maybe something isn't configured properly? ok, my understanding is it's just a shallow network, i assumed by batching you could send a lot of ops to the gpu. ok, thanks! 
solution: 

issue: apologies for interrupting - but is there anyway nd4j can throw an serializability error instead of npe's? in the case users don't set kryo registrator if its set - no problem 
solution: 

issue: so is the nd4s collection ops still broken ? [<-ISSUE->] im seeing it break in my project once i upgraded 
solution: map/filter etc. seem to not be doing anything to the array. 

issue: rahulpalamuttam: map/filter don't work because that would require supporting custom ops in Java, which is not the case anymore (for now?) 
solution: 

issue: there's boolean ops - i.e., apply some op where some condition applies is that what you are looking for? 
solution: needs to be documented properly - have a look at the class and the tests [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Can I can use deeplearning4j to identify text on image? what should I do? saudet: thanks for response,I'm makes A-Z picture,and then how can I do ? saudet: Sorry,My English  not  good,I can't understand your mean,Which class should I use? chrisvnicholson: thank you,I'm very happy

solution: 

issue: what's the slicing syntax for nd4j? i.e. the nd4j version of what you can do in nump -> npArray[0:5, 24:78] etc. nd4s had the apply((int, int)*) function 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: I'm trying to figure out how to implement custom loss function.. Is there an example to do this? I'm looking for MCXENT loss that supports class weights. Is this achievable in DL4j as of now by any chance? This is to deal with unbalanced classes Unless you can suggest a better way to deal with this issue :P yeah, I'm trying rebalancing, and it seems to work well would you suggest inflating the data, i.e. duplicating under-represented samples or deflating - removing over-represended samples?

solution: 

issue: Hi. Can anyone paste their pom dependencies for deep learning 4 j? I'm trying to set up a project for the first time and I can't find the nd4j  dependencies. 
solution: Yeah that pom is a little bit of a mess/confusing. What are the direct dependencies? It seems like a lot of the {refences} are missing or in multiple files. Easter doesn't come for another 8 months.. 

issue: I\'m attempting to run the \'dl4j-examples’  MLPLinearClassifier example.  i have this error :  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no jnind4j in java.library.path.

solution: 

issue: BDUG: Just post an issue for now We'd have to look at the configuration as well as the source code to id issue 
solution: yeah if it wasn't the wrapped model it wouldn't take long to look at. but it'd take a bit more to look at because of the model. 

issue: Thanks for beating up this computation graph api :D Definitely needed A lot of these things should be pretty easy/minor fixes 
solution: 

issue: eraly: To verify my understanding, would the RNN have exactly one neuron in its input layer? 
solution: 

issue: What would be the meaning of a regression model with multiple output nodes? In classification models one picks the node with highest value to identify most likely class. Is there any dependency between output nodes in regression models? Or can I treat them as independent predictors? Are there any major changes in 0.5.1-SNAPSHOT? When I switch over from 0.5.0 my score shoots into Infinity after few iterations 
solution: 

issue: Dear sirs, from the source code  [<-CODE->] I think the label should be named from 0. Is that right? Users of dl4j should manage the map of label by themselves 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: if I want to classify examples with nominal labels (i.e. string value), I need to convert the labels into continues integers that start at 0. Is that right? 
solution: All this stuff is just straight linear algebra. 

issue: Guys, I seeorg.deeplearning4j.nn.api.Modelinterface has no getUpdater/setUpdater, but bothComputationGraphandMultiLayerNetworkhave those. Would you consider add those toModel? Following that, shouldn't we want SparkDl4jMultiLayer to work with any implementation ofModel(e.g ComputationGraph)? Am I missing something here? Please ignore my last message. I just found about SparkComputationGraph 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: Sorry for late reply, I've posted an issue as suggested here: [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: qorrect: in case you are doing classification the labels have to be integer numbers 0 to numClasses

issue: if I run the LeNet example in dl4j-examples with nd4j-cuda-7.5-platform does it only use one gpu? 
solution: Just running on plain dl4j atm.  Will try the Skymind stuff tomorrow.. 

issue: hey guys, I'm still trying the GoogLeNet. Atm, I'm getting a NullPointerException in SubsamplingLayer. See [<-LINK->] do you have an idea what's causing this? wmeddie: : no, no cuda atm. AlexDBlack: : I think I found it. I had an orphan node (no follow up node towards the outputs). After I removed that, it seems to not occur any more yes, it seams so 
solution: 

issue: Are you using cuda? 
solution: 

issue: andreas-eberle: not sure. got something I can run? ok, cool. another thing to improve checks for in the config 
solution: 

issue: But how would I import UiConnectionInfo into my Spark project then? 
solution: also, right now i'm moving away all listeners out of dl4j-ui. 

issue: Hi I'm a newer using the deeplearning4j. I try to run my own example, but get an exception like: Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: org.nd4j.linalg.factory.Nd4jBackend$NoAvailableBackendException: Please ensure that you have an nd4j backend on your classpath.

issue: raver119: I've build a faster Spark (scala) wrapper for MultiLayerNetwork. So i'm not using the higher level methods, and I just didn't have the time to migrate to rc4.0 yet *built 
solution: can you credit me if you use it eventually?. 

issue: Does DL4J use CuDNN?  Does it run without it? 
solution: you can use it, and you can skip it. I see.  It should work on the LenetMnist sample then right?. 

issue: Is it normal that the ScoreIterationListener reports a score of NaN for a lot of iterations during the first epoch? 
solution: 

issue: It is supposed to use cudnn transparently or do I have to tweak the code somewhere? 
solution: however, i can’t confirm/decline that yet, since cuda8 isn’t available. i hadn’t read that paper, but if you’ll set your nn conf to use dropout - it’ll be definitely applied. There’s inverted dropout used in dl4j, though.

solution: 

issue: so you means that i could load my data from a CSV file? 
solution: But i think that I loaded the data from either Hive or HDFS csv file, the rdd is the same. And therdd.count()is not wrong/. 

issue: Hi, I’d like ask for some help, and I am sure you all must be sick of this question, so apologies in advance but I too suffer from 'no jnind4j in java.library.path’ though I am using 0.5.0 of the dependencies, and so my understanding is that trick with setting the java.library path to the empty string is no longer needed (not that it worked) here is my stack trace [<-LINK->] I am using sbt to build 
solution: Again check the sbt config there. 

issue: Hi guys, I asked about NaN scores yesterday. I can now confirm that the GPU and the CPU backend both give me NaN scores after about 200 iterations. Therefore it doesn't seam to be a Cuda issue. 
solution: 

issue: andreas-eberle: Also check your input data for extreme outliers. They can cause NaNs even if you are using zeroMeanAndUnitVariance normalization. We had this problem a few days ago… 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys, I'm trying to use the HistogramIterationListener, works well with the AdditionRNN example. When I use it in my application, the URL is correctly produced but it get stuck when it comes to open the browser or a new tab, so the training doesn't go any further (it does without the listener). As I don't get any error message, would you have an idea where it might come from, or if there are known issues about that ? 
solution: 

issue: wmeddie: Damn nice feature request That has all sorts of uses for me actually 
solution: Yeah, it also helps you size your layers.  When it starts going down you know you’ve reached the limit of your hardware.. 

issue: wmeddie: what’s your input data size? image height/width and num channels 
solution: Still messing around with LenetMnistExample. Is there something like that in dl4j-examples?. 

issue: could you please fill in detailed status there on your system? like gpu util etc for both w/o cudnn and w cudnn 
solution: for my own purposes i’ve used lenetmnist example with just different dataset resized to 200x200x3. 

issue: Hey, is there anyone experienced with CNN's here? I'm having serious trouble in terms of, my predicted values are the same regardless of input i say the same, it's a regression model whereby i'm predicting the fitness of a matrix( a heuristic)  where the values should vary between 0.64 and 0.95. But the net just spits out 0.85 every time with only varying digits at 5 decimal places.

solution: 

issue: johndemic: please make sure you're using latest examples & latest dl4j/nd4j version that's 0.5.0 
solution: and include your pom.xml there. 

issue: got it, thx@raver119- let me try again with 0.5.0 and make sure im not doing something stupid 
solution: you're probably just have something old in your deps. like canova. 

issue: Hey everyone. I've got problems to set up dl4j for Android. Is it supported at all? Any hints or working examples? So not supported :( ?

issue: Hi, guys, I am using the GravesLSTMCharModelingExample model on a word sequence instead of char sequence. The words are represented as vectors trained using Word2Vec model. But it outputs seomthing like this:23:11:44.038 [main] INFO  o.d.o.l.ScoreIterationListener - Score at iteration 0 is 37.8630733850497523:11:45.656 [main] INFO  o.d.o.l.ScoreIterationListener - Score at iteration 1 is -319.8579961515657723:11:46.681 [main] INFO  o.d.o.l.ScoreIterationListener - Score at iteration 2 is -897.588469960011523:11:48.071 [main] INFO  o.d.o.l.ScoreIterationListener - Score at iteration 3 is -1250.6390296020918 This mean it is not working correctly, right? 
solution: right, probably have the wrong loss function then - mcxent assumes a one-hot vector for labels. 

issue: hi - when we slice an array for a particular index - why does nd4j keep a dimension value of 0 in the shape? for example a 1 x 20 x 20 array has shape (1, 20, 20) i slice for index (0, 0) gives me an array of shape (0, 20, 20) 
solution: 

issue: hmm numpy does that thing of keeping the 0 size dimension as well i posted the issue anyway in anycase i can reshape 
solution: 

issue: May I ask if I want to manually provide the gradient with a feed forward neural net,  what should I do 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] Took three hours but now I know a lot more about time series datasets. 
solution: Might want to train it a little more.  The model included is run on default settings.. yeah I'd likely tweak it. 

issue: Ok. When I run this code, the console prints "Started on port 8080" and keeps running without any other information, and I have to stop it by hand. 
solution: that looks like some legacy overlap for me, it was used for TSNE earlier.... 

issue: raver119: : I think I found a CUDA bug. My config works with CPU, but fails with when run with CUDA-7.5 with this error [<-LINK->] raver119: : Here is the issue: [<-ISSUE->] .

issue: No with us running Eg run us and see if the gpu is used Post your pom.xml as a gist please Exactly as he said? Put it in your project 
solution: AnnaKim77: also check out cudnn if you haven't already. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] Easier copy/paste version 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. Yes. (embedded getTADLength). 

issue: please copy page url not a script start changing things use 0.5.0 exclude canova, and replace it with DataVec also include deeplearning4j-cuda-7.5  for cudnn 
solution: 

issue: Can you show us device query output? The device query installed with the cuda samples under utilities? 
solution: agibsonccc: i see dl4j-nlp in deps. so i'd like to know what exactly the task user runs :). i want to compare cpu and gpu performance using LenetMnistExample which you guys provided.. 

issue: AnnaKim77: great, gpu util is 0%. is it changing after training starts? run it like "watch -n 1 nvidia-smi" so it'll be updated automatically however, i definitely see allocated memory there, so it should work. 
solution: 

issue: With CPU only If i run it with openmp set to 1 core and pinned to 16 threads I can also run it in a little under 9 minutes. 
solution: There's a lot of things we haven't tried yet in that space.

solution: 

issue: one more question, is there any way to read the new DecayRate of my network after passing some iterations? sorry I meant the learning rate not the decay Is there any way to read the new learning rate of my network after some iterations decay? 
solution: You can just create a custom one for that. so do you mean, that learning rate is attached to every layer separately? I thought it was one variable for all... 

issue: When using a ImagePreProcessingScaler, I have to fit the iterator, then loop on every DataSet and use transform on them ? Or is there a new way for data normalization ?  On one of the example I saw transform() being use on the iterator, but it look like you can't do that anymore Ok so I just call transform() on every DataSet, thx

issue: Hi, I think there might be a problem in MovingWindowDataSetFetcher. It callsMovingWindowMatrix.windows with flattened and addRotate both set to true. However, I think this causes a problem since a flattened matrix can't be rotated because it fails the isMatrix test. Am i mistaken? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, when calling f1 score in between epochs of training (on a val set) I get an error about wrong column sizes. 
solution: 

issue: ok so ill have to work with a previous version. i actually only tried to update to 0.5.0 after@raver119told me to because I was getting the exception from org.nd4j.linalg.factory.Nd4jBackend$NoAvailableBackendException, but since this backend thing was introduced in 0.4rc3.8, shouldn't that exception be gone when using a backend (eg nd4j-native)? what about 3.9? 
solution: 

issue: hi everyone, I trained a net for image classification and I reached a 75%-80% score. Now I'm tryin to apply the trained net to new image to predict the label. I trained my network loading images 150x150 as RecordReaderDataSetIterator with size 135x135, saved the batches with BalanceMinibatches and then loaded for training as a ExistingMiniBatchDataSetIterator. I tried to classify images from the training set but I always get wrong prediction and an output like [0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 1.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, ..... ].

issue: FelixVoelker: seeing issues during forward pass on that, but can't see where the problem is that's on dl4j master though mind opening an issue here, and I'll look into today? as@eralysaid, could be an edge case or something I'll need to step through in a debugger to work out what's going on FelixVoelker: see comments here: [<-ISSUE->] xozealotox: what version of DL4J are you using? 
solution: 

issue: turambar: @eralyThank you for the feedback! I think the problem is that I don't fully understand how the RNN training data and output is structured so I'll try to read up more on that before creating my own model. 
solution: 

issue: Hi, could we load data file asDataSetIteratorfrom HDFS? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: Hi! Been some time since I worked with dl4j, but was planning on starting up a new project soon. Has there been any updates for [<-ISSUE->] Or should I just skip training with GPU? raver119: All right! Looking forward to hopefully some kind of answer ^^

issue: Are there any precautions one need to consider when disposing NDArrays? For the context, I'm investigating memory leak when almost all memory is consumed on a server but no tool shows that any process holds it. This is when off-heap storage for NDArrays comes to mind. I haven't found any mention in docs or public methods that there's a way to dispose NDArray so wondering if it's done properly inside and how to check that. version 0.4-rc3.8. thanks

issue: Hello everyone. I've recently learnt about deep4j and asked a one of my colleague friends about it. He tried using it and still does in his research. He admitted that implementation of NN in deep4j is pretty hard in comparison with popular python/lua alternative libraries. He said that not only it is a lot more code it is not easy to follow the logic of deep4j. So, I need a second biased opinion :)

solution: 

issue: rcorbish: most users don't need to worry about orders; in some cases you can get better order by using one or the order explicitly. (time series data for RNNs is one of the few cases that matters, as per last paragraph here: [<-LINK->] )do you have a use case in mind where this might matter? AlexKershaw: two types of termination conditions with our early stopping implementation: iteration and epoch, see this for example: [<-LINK->] you might need to implement your own custom condition depending on what you are looking for rcorbish: right, everything will work with c or f order - just one or the other might be faster in certain circumstances. mathematically, the results will be identical regardless of array orders kftsehk: sounds like you are using an old version... what version are you using?

issue: hey guys, could you give me some pointers for articles on RNNs with multiple examples (i.e. multiple time series) training? I can't seem to find anything explaining how the RNN model is built and what should be the relationship between each time series example. thanks! is it like each time series generates a model independent from all the other time series? 
solution: 

issue: typical approach is one model, trained based on multiple time series examples as input - same as any other model in that respectfor example speech recognition - one model, whole lot of training data 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] Saw this yet? That has the shape of the time series in there You can specify batch size and window length Speech still has windows/samples you extract Same features You have to have a unifying feature vector That is applicable for any ml though Not just time series

issue: Is this the right channel for Cuda issues? I\'m running into this error ("IllegalStateException: Can\'t allocate [DEVICE] special buffer memory!") after upgrading DL4J to 0.5 from 0.4-rc3.10.  DL4J was working with Cuda 7.5 before the upgrade. Should I file it against nd4j or deeplearning4j, or does it matter?

issue: Hi, any timeline for Reinforcement Learning examples? I think someone already wrote an example using Q learning? Did not see that A3C is work in progress 
solution: So if you do end up doing that 'd consider extending A3C...we have one that's ALMOST done in there / cc@rubenfiszel. Async learning: A3C and nstep learning (requires some missing features from dl4j (calc and apply gradients))..

solution: 

issue: raver119: : The model loading problem with half precision is the same with your ModelSerializer... I updated the ticket with the stack trace I cannot load any of my models trained with half precision :( 
solution: when I don't set it to half, the loading works, but it complains that there might be a loss of data due to not matching data types. 

issue: AlexDBlack: Hi Alex,  does every layer in the  computation graph configuration has to be specified with nIn and nOut? I failed to connect the subsampling layer (following a cnn layer) to a feedforward dense layer in my graph configuration... do I need a preprocessor? 
solution: nOut is always necessary for layers that have parameters (i.e., convolutional, dense etc - not subsampling though). nIn can be set automatically using InputTypes functionality, but there was a bug in last release (already fixed on dl4j master though).

solution: 

issue: using  mlpclassiermoon  for iris data but keep getting this error : Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Mis matched lengths: [150] != [200] , any idea? 
solution: 

issue: I mean any of these are going to be related to your neural net config I can't run it right now Your config didn't look off so I'd make sure all your iterators have the same same inputs You shouldn't be manually doing anything at all For CNNs you leave it as is You don't do anything Just make sure your input batch sizes are 4d 
solution: 

issue: I have a feeling that the problem I was having isn't a bug.  It's more of an enhancement.  I'll make a issue once I can make a similar dataset that doesn't have PII in it. 
solution: No problem.  I'm in a similar boat right now.  Customer wants something by the end of this month.. 

issue: I got an error like below in dl4j junit test casehttps://gist.github.com/rikima/a893034f2fe8fa407d706218e9eff80cIt seems that it is very simple classpath setting problem.Does anyone teach me this classpath info. on latest ver. of dl4j 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I was hoping someone could give me an idea on how to evaluate my best model after early stopping in 0.5.0. The code I had for 0.4-rc3.8 doesn't work anymore. It seems that EarlyStoppingResult now returns a Model instead of a MultiLayerNetwork and Model doesn't have an output(INDArray) method Is there something equivalent on Model? Think I worked it out, built a new MultiLayerNetwork using the params from my Model and original config.

issue: AlexDBlack: on updating a cg with external error, as seen in the cg examples ( [<-LINK->] ). This had worked for me with 1 output. I have now added multiple outputs and am calling something like         Gradient gradient = trainingGraph.backpropGradient(vError, lError, mError);This throws a nullpointer in:protected INDArray getLabels2d(){if(labels.rank() > 2) {return labels.reshape(labels.size(2),labels.size(1));}return labels;}the if check of this method. I suppose labels are null. I am not sure if I am supposed to set labels in the first place if I am using an external error. I dont really have labels, I just have errors. Any suggestions? oh and stacktrace: [<-LINK->] rubenfiszel: tells me he solves this by re-arranging from errors and outputs to get targets/labels, but in the example where backpropgradient is computed this is not done, so it seems like a bug in the cg, not sure 
solution: 

issue: Is there any specific reason why DL4J examples go through great lengths constructing iterators for datasets instead of creating simple ArrayList<DataSet> to train a network? I mean, I'm sure there is a reason ;) Just not what the reason is. 
solution: there is ann iterator which takes a List as argument ;). but most of them were actually added not that long ago :). 

issue: I think I asked before, but is there a reason why Nd4j doesn't accept shapes of a single dimension? 
solution: petri_koski_twitter:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: AlexDBlack: re: the issue I posted earlier about cgs. I have found the specific issue. Right now, you can use an external error on a computationgraph only if the output layers of the cg are not of type output layer, but any other (e.g. denselayer). If they are outputlayers when you callGradient gradient = cg.backpropGradient(vError, lError, mError);, this throws a nullpointer on the get label. So pretty sure this is unintended 
solution: 

issue: oh.. I just test it on eclipse .. Just copy pasted code there and trying it on my real spark cluster in near future. So you are saying that I am trying it on "local mode" not on real cluster and thats why I get that error .. ? 
solution: 

issue: thisIsNiceName: nout is the length of your output. That shouldn't change. For eg, If you are doing a classifier with two outputs - one for cat, one for not cat, nout is 2 not without retraining the network... if understand correctly they are not only new but you need more outputs also? 
solution: 

issue: Could slip cat/dog "reminders" in with the bird/flower data. There\'s also a technique that involves using synthesized inputs to help a network remember something it already learned while it\'s trained on something new, although unfortunately the name escapes me at the moment. 
solution: These are not concepts specific to dl4j. They are concepts related to neural nets in general.. Not sure how it\'s done in DL4J, but you should be able to copy the weights from the old network to the new one and then train on the bird/flower data (but also, as@eralysays, you\'ll need to be careful to avoid the network "forgetting" what it\'s learned about dogs/cats).

issue: dear all, when i run a simple code with iris, the warning  occure： Warning: class 1 was never predicted by the model. This class was excluded from the average precision why? how to deal with it? then the accreacy is very low. AlexDBlack: what do you mean? I can't find the answer from it. I have tried for a long time. 
solution: 

issue: @agibsonccc  Okay, now I at least have got a working implementation, thanks for pointing me in the correct dimension :)The problem I have now is that the score at iteration n is stuck at NaN, would you be so kind to point me in the right direction to fix my error again :) ?https://gist.github.com/s103451/adeb8bfc4e2b982cc3e58b040dda78db 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: Dear, I am puzzled by the code in example:  DataSet allData = iterator.next(); the iterartor return the next element in the interation, but the type is Dataset? it is some wield. I think it should be some type like Integer, Float...not a type used in data set.@agibsonccc agibsonccc: a dataset means a lot of  elements, not one element.

issue: Hi guys,is it planned to implement nd.mul() in order to take account tensors with different shapes, by implicit broadcast ? AlexDBlack: yes I tried to do the job by myself with this function but it seems not working fine for broadcasting on  several dimensions so I found a workaround by playing with permute and reshape, but the perfs are not good :/ 
solution: 

issue: wmeddie: could just be a bug, not sure how well that method is tested as I don't think we use it anywhere?we're using native image loader these days (sadly it doesn't have an equivalent method) Jajawah: we do have broadcast mul op as a separate thing (i.e., not by x.mul(y))... but it's not exactly well documented [<-LINK->]

issue: reckart: if you are using the WordVectors instance just to get Word Vectors for certain words, I have a very specialized version with a custom binary format that doesn't load the whole file into memory at once, but instead uses mmap() to get just the vectors, DM me if you'd like to have that 
solution: raver119: i was thinking if there is some default/built-in way of persisting a google vec object in a binary representation, I might be able to save on loading time because there's no float-parsing involved anymore and also normalization already would have happened - also it might be more compact. 

issue: Heya. I'm trying to visualise the first layer of weights in a DBN (one image for each of the 300 hidden nodes). The only way i've found to extract the values of the weights from the model is by using .params(). Is there a way to find out how exactly the entries of the resulting INDArray are ordered? Or is it just W00,.......,W0N,W10,......,W1N,..............,WMN, where the first index is a hidden neuron, and the second a visible one? I'm using arbiter on a network with RBMs, but I get the following error message [<-LINK->] . This is how I set up the network: [<-LINK->] The problem seems to be that RBM can't be used with MultyLayerSpace? What else should I use?

solution: AlexDBlack: Dear Alex, I can't find the way to access the elements, if can I use the function just as the function 'foreach' in scala to access the each element in a INDarray?. 

issue: medinamanuel: multi-dimensional LSTM is definitely possible, but we'd need to think a bit about data structures and the like there, for activations etcI've done a lot of the RNN stuff in dl4j (and about to do some work on built-in custom layer support) so feel free to ping me directly if you want to talk

solution: 

issue: I can code java and feel quite comfortable with it but I don't have much knowledge on how machine learning works. I know you need to normalize your data in order to work with it and have basic understanding of inputs, outputs and I managed to run some tests with neuroph, because its very easy to understand, I guess what I am trying to ask is Do I have to learn all the math behind machine learning in order to work with it? Or I can learn the basics and I will be just fine? 
solution: 

issue: in Supervised learning there are many algorithms that can solve the same problem am I correct? so how do you pick which one to use? so I make my decision by who is going to use the algorithm (client(phone) or Server) for example.. and training time for the data etc but even if it doesn't perform well I still need to know if the problem is within my settings or the algorithm itself so many things to configure with dl4j 
solution: 

issue: is it possible to use TransformProcess to add extra fields that are from the next row in the iterator? basically, I want to predict the next piece of data in a time series input agibsonccc: yes I am!

solution: regardless on whether you insist on using it like that (instead of using the platform artifact) or doing it the recommended way, you will have to have the nd4j-native dependency without the classifier.

issue: the mnist MLPMnistSingleLayer example was explained concisely in a tutorial on the website. Once the model is trained, how would you load a mnist image (a new case) stored in .ppm format, and then predict its label? I have tried for hours to hack it out by using the MnistImageFile, or an ImageLoader classes, solely by reading  the javadocs, but are not quite there. Any help, guidance or sample code would be appreciated. Thanks.

solution: 

issue: Is MSE not GPU compatible? GPU usage 0% odd 
solution: I usually have them commented out but since you mentioned to check the activations..

In every DataSet element in RDD, I set the label equal to feature, and train a autoencoder model. then i want to evaluate the model, and use thepublic JavaDoubleRDD scoreExamples(JavaRDD<DataSet> data, boolean includeRegularizationTerms, int batchSize)method, try to get the difference between normal data and anomaly data. but it returnsNaN. according to my issue, do i miss some configuration about my data processing step? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I'm using word2vec to cluster words via wmdistance and affinity propagation and i'm experiencing weird issue. While clustering I only use methods getWordVectorMatrix and hasWord to compute wmdistance between each word. After that I use wordNearest to get 1 word, which defines cluster. If I make 2 runs of clustering with same settings result is different... If I don't call wordsNearest after first run everything is OK... 
solution: default wordsNearest provider applies normalization to vectors.

issue: Hello. When setting the deeplearning4j project in IntelliJ (git clone) some packages can't be found. Concretely: org.nd4j and org.datavec. pom.xml says they expect version 0.5.1-SNAPSHOT. Am I missing something? Would appreciate if you can point me to the right direction. Checking the actual code. Trying to see if I can implement MultidimensionalLSTM 
solution: 

issue: just to get my head around it.. the NN will 'index' existing responses, and retrieve the best match based on incoming message? agibsonccc:  [<-LINK->] ? no, thats not manning 
solution: 

issue: I'm having trouble using the CSVRecordReader and RecrodReaderDataSetIterator, I can't get the record reader to return my labels, even though I have them set at the top of the csv file 
solution: not sure what you expect, but labels are just a column with an integer index (or, optionally multiple columns with real values in the case of regression). 

issue: Can Datavec balance minibatches so the count of each class is equal? I've been doing it myself thus far. 
solution: blackwingf: You shouldn't need to worry about that. 

issue: when I use custom dataset on mnist feedforward demo it fails [<-LINK->] my code [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: DToother_twitter: two things to check - (a) that you are up to date with latest version (0.5.0) and (b) that your iterator is correct - hasNext() etc correct version first, there was an issue with async iterator that's fixed as of 0.5.0 not worth looking into it otherwise 
solution: 

issue: What do I put on the right hand side? JavaRDD<DataSet> trainingData = ...(I have a DataSetIterator ready) time series locally I'm working from BasicDataVecExample. What I really am trying to do here is filter out some examples from the DataSet. The BasicDataVecExample shows a way to filter extreme values, for instance. Is there another way? 
solution: AlexDBlack: Yes I'm working on that preprocessing step now. I have 180,000 DataSets saved to disk. Some of those have extreme outliers in them. I was wondering whether there was a way to filter those out using some technique besides just recreating the DataSets omitting the outliers?Because maybe I want to experiment with various outlier thresholds and recreating all the DataSets takes time.. 

issue: it depends. what sort of data is it? are you training on a cluster? or locally? don't bother with spark then 
solution: 

issue: I upload the bestModel files to ubuntu . Some errors occur as follow : java.io.InvalidClassException: org.deeplearning4j.nn.updater.MultiLayerUpdater; local class incompatible: stream classdesc serialVersionUID = 5140445576767494002, local class serialVersionUID = 7792279892583822027 I use LocalFileModelSaver to save model to my mac and then upload to ubuntu Thank you for you sugguestion. I train the model with 0.4 and in ubuntu I use 0.5. My mistake So I train my model with 0.5 and the error will disappear, right? raver119: @agibsonccc  it works 
solution: Yeah you don't need it for the model. 

issue: It trains !!! :DD  Accuracy:  0.0434 but it works 
solution: 

issue: I\'m all for anything that helps make using sbt assembly for Spark stuff "Just Work" 
solution: Finally caught up (at the behest of waiting for microsoft :(). and nvidia. Once you know what packages to filter it's not too bad, but wading through all the dependency tree output is painful.. 

issue: Hi - does anyone know why I might sometimes be getting negative outputs from my NN? The output of every single input of the training data is >= 0, but sometimes I'm getting negative numbers outputted for testing data It makes no sense in this context for the output to be < 0, is there anything I can do to the NN configuration for this? 
solution: 

issue: AlexKershaw: I guess you are using your NN for regression? 
solution: 

issue: hmm, NormalizerStandardize doesn't work for outputs ('labels')? So I guess it's not really suitable for regression has anyone found a convenient way to get around this? Yeah I'll do that, cheers! Awesome Susan - I'll take a look thanks :D I guess I can't use that if I'm using dl4j through Maven though :/ 
solution: 

issue: Where do I file bugs? NormalizerStandardize.transform(DataSetIterator) doesn't actually work, because it normalizes each DataSet in turn but because the iterator.next() creates a new DataSet (I'm using ListDataSetIterator), the normalizing doesn't actually modify the iterator 
solution: I have an iterator that represents my training data (each DataSet represents a data point - an input array and output array). 

issue: Guys, silly question -- I'm writing a 1000 x 10 matrix to file via Nd4j.write(...) but when I read it, I get EOFException I don't get the same issue with vectors! any ideas? 
solution: 

issue: (The data I read for vectors is also corrupt... I guess it's another issue with DType) AlexDBlack: sure... I bet I had read/written Nd4j to file before, but I can't get it to work now AlexDBlack: here it is: [<-ISSUE->] AlexDBlack: am I doing something stupid with opening files for reading and writing?! I tried different charset encoders/decoders but that didn't help. 
solution: 

issue: I did normalize based on imagePreprocessingScalar to convert dataset to datasetiteration. Got this error:  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ClassCastException: org.deeplearning4j.datasets.datavec.RecordReaderDataSetIterator cannot be cast to org.nd4j.linalg.dataset.api.DataSet 
solution: 

issue: how does this sound: take predictions, actual values, scale all the values, get % difference between values (error) , track mean/median error? I'd also like to detect anomalies, would just detecting if mean error exceeds a threshold be enough? 
solution: 

issue: Is this an issue that has been reported already?java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Cannot allocate 30541872412 + 1920 bytes (> Pointer.maxBytes)at org.bytedeco.javacpp.Pointer.deallocator(Pointer.java:486) 
solution: ~30GB not enough? It's only a six neuron network.. 

issue: I get a different error between nd4j and numpy when using .std() INDArray arrA = Nd4j.create(new double[][]{{1,2,3,4},{1,2,4,5},{2,3,4,4}}); agibsonccc: should I just stick with nd4j's one? 
solution: This is closer to apache commons math. If you want absolute precision you can use the double data type too. 

issue: Hi -  does deepLearning4j support spark 2.0.0? It seems it works just with spark 1.5.2... 
solution: 

issue: hi@AlexDBlack- any ideas on that data vs model parallelism question? 
solution: i'd say that i see model parallelism viable mostly for multi-gpu cases, when models are too big to fit into single gpu, and you still have multiple gpus available. 

issue: So actually, theParallelWrapperis replicating the model among the workers, doesn’t it? So using 10 workers means 10 models and memory is 10x bigger. Then data is also splitted into 10 nodes, thus if i have a batch size is 64, actual batch size is 64*10=640. Maybe basic questions. 
solution: 

issue: sighlombok doesn't make it easier to trace method calls and variable use across the codebase... 
solution: "eclipse". 

issue: I have used IntelliJ in the past for particular projects - but my cluttered Eclipse workspace feels more cozy. 
solution: On the topic of lombok though, Intellij also kind of complains that it can't find sources that match the compiled jar when you open a class that uses lombok.. 

issue: AlexDBlack: I added the normalization code (ImagePipeline + Lenet combined example), but the "NaN" issue remains.  Latest code can be found here [<-LINK->] What could be wrong? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: are you referring to my post on "NaN" issue?  I merged the ImagePipeline and Lenet examples with no changes to the layer configuration. 
solution: agibsonccc: this is what I have taken as is... [<-LINK->]. 

issue: I think@saudetchanged it a while back to align with one of the caffe examples for comparison, etc but yeah, not best practice really 
solution: Huh, I wonder why that works for MNIST....

solution: 

issue: zharvey-welltok: dedicated machine for model parameters... typically workers calculate and send gradients to it 
solution: 

issue: as an outsider looking in, itsoundslike parameter servers are possibly solved by consensus servers like consul or even ZK. but it sounds like you're implying they're not efficient with binary data somehow? 
solution: well, zk/consul are for lots of things besides config. they can act as a key-value store, implement sync primitives, help with service discovery, etc. but you got me on the binary/size item - they're definitely not geared for huge payloads of data to read/write, especially if we're reading/writing repetitively and often. 

issue: not sure, but can you really have negative labels? the error suggest no 
solution: dan-lind: I still get the same error, any other idea's what might be causing this?. 

issue: DToother_twitter: 3.6 is really outdated, lacks of 100500 fixes and improvements applied after 3.6 
solution: i dont have pictures for a few letters in alphabet. johndemic: it means that your training set is missing examples for class 9. 

issue: Hi everyone. I am new using Maven and Nd4j. I have followed the instructions to install and set up everything. However when I try to do one of the basic examples Maven returns this compilation error: error: package org.nd4j.linalg.api does not exist 
solution: 

issue: IsraelGasperin_twitter: You can follow a few maven with intellij tutorials I'd advise doing that first  [<-LINK->] The docs are great We\'re just "add a nd4j dependency" like every other java/scala based project not much overhead there ChessPoker:  [<-LINK->] Ctrl + f mkl DToother_twitter: It's REALLY hard for us to justify supporting manual dependency management We flat out don't support it here Dl4j has way too many jars You're only causing mutual headaches when you do that 
solution: 

issue: ChessPoker: Updated instructions: [<-LINK->] In a nutshell, make sure libiomp5.so is in your library path 
solution: next release will be out soon with that fix. 

issue: hi, I exported the project to .jar. And it works in local. But it can't work at other devices. it says:Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no jnind4j in java.library.path 
solution: 

issue: my rnn only outputs very small values 0-1, but I want 0-200, how can I fix this? 
solution: 

issue: you want to normalize your data to a small range (like, 0 to 1 or -1 to +1). then undo the normalization to get the 'true' predictions 
solution: 

issue: dev62363_twitter: post the full stack trace in a gist? (gist.github.com or pastebin) best guess there: .nOut() on your output layer not matching the actual label (DataSet.getLabels()) size (dimension 1 size)

issue: Can anyone see my messsage? 
solution: I was wondering how I could pre-train a model so I could only use it for testing?. 

issue: AlexDBlack: @agibsoncccMy plan is to create an RL demo for my Machine Learning Exposed! presentation that uses a dl4j neural net to map states to Q-values, perhaps as discussed in the following article: [<-LINK->] 
solution: But I'm also considering using OpenAI Gym for environment and agent visualization.  Lots of choices to make as I create the demo.. 

issue: dev-682 problems with training?? what are you training, convolutional? 
solution: Yeah if its tuning related I have zero sympathy for you. 

issue: hello, I would like to ask if it's possible to get an explanation of the ImageRecordReader, I can't really understand the description in the Javadoc

solution: 

issue: hi@agibsonccc@treo, have a few mins to come up for air, was hoping to talk more about parameter server requirements. imightbe able to help/contribute here, but can't commit to anything (i work full time + have kids, which means i have approximately no time whatsoever to do anything fun or for myself) either way, interested in requirements Besides parameter averaging, what kinds of ops does the param server need to do? For each of these ops, what is the basic IPOS flow/diagram/API? sounds good - thx@AlexDBlack 
solution: 

issue: zharvey-welltok: I'll direct message you with some notes on the various approaches used for distributed training in neural networks (fyi I've been focused on our spark implementation of late, so I'd want to be involved in any conversations around a parameter server) jdpitt: like in this paper? [<-LINK->] we should have an example for that in a few weeks.@raver119is going to be building that out soon currently missing the pooling across time component, however fixed length sentence inputs should be doable though but not examples for that yet

issue: Hi I am looking an example of how to use word2vect output to train a cnn to classify text yes\\ I am looking how to do it with dl4j is there an example of cnn? because even if its not exactly the same implementation i would like to try if there is a cnn to classify images i think I can make it work with the word2vect output ok cool i already run some of the examples i will try that right away thank you very much 
solution: 

issue: jdpitt: Stick to our examples versions That stuff is in maven central I'm getting the feeling your'e not describing the actual error :( Look closer at th epom.xml in the project No use our examples the main ones 
solution: and so far i fix the erro I mentioned.  [<-LINK->] one has what you need: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: hmmm, not seeing a 'chat privately' option. for instance, if i  mouseover your avatar, i see a dialog pop up that has your profile image, your name & username, #followers, #repos, #following, your website/org and your location....but not a chat option 
solution: looks like you (and likely everyone else here) is on the dl4j gitter channel/thing.

issue: Hi,  I'm new to deeplearning, so thanks in advance for any guidance.  I'm trying to expand on the ParagraphVectorsClassifierExample; re-writing it to fit my needs (mainly changing how the labeled documents are captured for now).  However, when I try to build the paragraphVectors, it fails with a java.lang.RuntimeException: CUDA backend can't find NVCC within PATH environment variable when trying to build the InMemoryLookupTable$Builder.  I don't see anything in the java file that talks about CUDA, and I've tried removing the CUDA module from the pom.xml.  Is there a way to disable this?  Based on my searches it looks like I want 'native', but i'm not how this can be done. Thanks. 
solution: 

issue: Tried importing at different levels... none seemed to fix the CUDA issue.   I see you mentioned I should rebuild my app.  To be clear, this is the examples from the quickstart.  The project is brand new, and just built. I try to run, and I get this error. I also tried to invalidate my cache and restart, but that also had no impact :( 
solution: 

issue: Thanks@raver119I created a feature request: [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: dmallela: FWIW paragraph vectors and word2vec on the gpu isn't even worth it Those need to be redone for the gpu That sounds like a cuda error I'm guessing internal kernel Raver is against cuda-memcheck So I'm not sure what to try beyond that but it'd be good to see if you could isolate wher ethis happens interesting Is this with master? If not I'd want to se what bugs have been fixed before looking at this much further no dl4j master 
solution: Not worth trying to build from master right now?. 

issue: I think I’ve seen this before but can’t remember what this error means: CUDA error at /skymind/libnd4j/blas/cuda/NativeOps.cu:5907 code=77(<unknown>) "cudaStreamSynchronize(*stream)" I’m getting it when running MultiGpuLenetMnistExample on Azure when the server has multiple GPUs It runs fine on a single GPU. (MultiGpuLenetMnistExample on a single GPU that is.) dl4j-examples:master? 
solution: 

issue: pir-dsl: you shoudn’t use parallel wrapper for 1 gpu etc just run lenet example as is wmeddie: you’d better file an issue about that crush

solution: 

issue: raver119: I just saw that you pushed the cuda example. Does that mean you are starting on the parVec CNN example? Sorry for being pushy about that, but I'm really looking forward to see how this should be done :) 
solution: 

issue: Good day! It there a simple way to stop fitting neural network without using early stopping logic ( [<-LINK->] For example, I want to stop training when score reached some constant. Now I only can stop fitting via "ComputationGraphConfiguration conf = ... ..iterations(1000); ...; this.net.fit(this.trainDataSet);" For example, can I request to stop Model fitting in custom IterationListener - looking at current model error score? Thank you. Please answer my question ;-) 
solution: raver119: thx for the suggestion, I will try just Lenet example later.

I am trying to glue together a cnn with an rnn and the existing preprocessor for that doesn't work in my case. In my case, I am trying to convolve over time. So The height dimension (3rd) is time and the width (4th) is the dimensions of the feature vector. There is one channel.

issue: agibsonccc: Can you point me in the direction of the ImageNormalizer? I can't find any information on it 
solution: jamesdbaker: @webstormsI linked it earlier: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: agibsonccc: What would be the preferred way of using the ImagePreProcessingScaler in conjunction with the DataSetIterator? 
solution: and use it to pre process the dataset like that. @webstorms I just did...DataSetIterator trainIter = new RecordReaderDataSetIterator(trainReader, batchSize, 1, outputNum);trainIter.setPreProcessor(scaler);. 

issue: ImagePreProcessingScaler doesn't have state, fyi (unlike NormalizerStandardize or NormalizerMinMaxScaler) so don't even need to fit it 
solution: AlexDBlack: "so don\'t even need to fit it"?. As far as I can see, yes. So I only use the following: set.setPreProcessor(myScaler)?. 

issue: The key with any of the normalizer is to use the trends in the training data Yeah fit on that is a no op Good habit to get into though Sounds like it yeag Yeah All images are 0 to 1? 
solution: webstorms: that means that the fit call does nothing with that normalizer.

issue: Hi, I am working with time series data, and would like to use LSTM.  The problem I have is normalization: I would like to normalize my time-series data based on a moving average or on averages of fixed time frames but I can't find a way to do that in DataVec Do you have any ideas? Standard normalization wouldn't work for my problem, because the distribution of time series features is always changing 
solution: 

issue: njohnst: we don't have moving averages like Adam said. The zero mean unit variance will handle time series. So if you have multiple time series that you want to normalize across, even with different features it will work. But no moving average as is. Feel free to ping me with questions. 
solution: 

issue: I'm trying to run the MultiGpuLenetMnistExample example but get the following output: [<-LINK->] Didn't modify any of the POMs or code Can't I run the example on 1 gpu? 
solution: and no, since you're on mac, i suppose that's a laptop, with mid-end gpu, with like 2gb of ram. so probably multiple lenet models just won't fit there. 

issue: webstorms: to start with, you've got mac with multiple gpus? can i have deviceQuery output? besides that - that error says that you're lacking cuda toolkit installed 
solution: 

issue: I\'m starting a new project based off the simple "RegressionSum" linear regression example in dlj4-examples, trying to figure out which maven dependencies I should start with. is is wise to use the 0.5.X releases yet?

issue: ale86ch: I wrote some code early today that resizes image proportionally, will send you a link now 
solution: I've set this up to work with square images though. 

issue: no way, since it’s not released yet only way to get use of cuda8, is to build libnd4j manually for now 
solution: it’s not a big deal, and libnd4j is already supporting cuda8 rc. so after nvidia releases cuda8 - we do the same. i will try to build then.

issue: Hi Im facing trouble running the rnn sentiment analysis example on an Ubuntu machine. Can you guys help me out? I am trying to load the Google Word2Vec model, which is 3.6 GB,  and run the Word2VecSentimentRNN example application. 
solution: 

issue: getting an exception? post it in a gist (gist.github.com) and paste link here 
solution: 

issue: So does the current release change the padding in order for (input size - kernel + 2*padding)/stride to be an integer? I've got 92x112 sized images that I want to use with the DeepFaceVariant ( [<-LINK->] ), so I'm guessing I'll need to work out the size the images need to be in order for them to work with the CNN What would be the easiest way for me to do so? Matching up the first layer with the input image wouldn't fix things, would it? 
solution: So you would have to have the first layer match. 

issue: Is this right? Any dimension of the image (let it be x) must produce an integer when inserted into the expression: [<-LINK->] And letting the expression equal an integer z I can solve for x and then determine the all the possibilities of x that will work with the DeepFaceVariant config? 
solution: agibsonccc:  [<-LINK->] In the new release we will be migrating that functionality to the config itselfbut same principal appliesoops. 

issue: webstorms: So you meant to pass each input with different sizes? Then the parameters of the net for each input image are different, right? I also doubted that it can work or not Yeah, for images same size should work. 
solution: 

issue: How can I retrieve the error of the model at ever epoch such that I can store it in a variable? 
solution: That is what I was looking for. it averages and propagates arbitrary number of INDArrays. however, it's native and thus on multi-gpu, when averaging should be done on multiple devices at once - p2p should be supported. So that's for serious hardware method there.. 

issue: out of curiosity - what kind of projects are you working on at skymind? Does this involve a lot of image processing? there is a lot of stuff for this in place Yeah you'd expect this.. Do you often build deep models for the projects that make money? 
solution: 

issue: Is there any tuning needed to get training processes distributed across multiple CPU's/cores?   I've got 8 cores assigned to my dl4j virtual machine.  While in the training cycle, I'm seeing utilization move from core to core, but only a couple of cores being accessed at any given time.  I'm running Centos 6.5. I'm trying to get my boss to approve a GPU but I'm not quite there yet :) I've got 24 cores at my disposal for now. 
solution: 

issue: mppurcell: in theory no (it's all vectorized c++ code, should use all cores)... not sure how your VM will impact things thoughI'd go with something lighter weight like docker if you canalso: more in depth performance discussion is generally in here: [<-LINK->] romeokienzler: what version are you using? that looks insanely old 
solution: 

issue: hello sir, I tried to build my own CNN based on some paper, article I read on the internet on java to detect palm. But here's the problem, I trained some images with only 1 output node at the end, with expected result around 0.867... and it work so far, except that it get around the expected result too, when I input the wrong data. I used sigmoid activation. Is there any term I can look up to solve this problem? 
solution: 

issue: Would this work for cross validation (calling fit on the multiple DataSetIterators)? [<-LINK->] Can I call model.fit on multiple DatasetIterators? 
solution: 

issue: here: Can I get some comments and feedback on this? Am I re-inventing a wheel I dont know exists? I really would prefer not to use jackson (but I am not willing to unless I am sure I am not waisting my time) [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Just an FYI - I was very careful to add all the entries shown in the POM provided by the DL4J installation guide for Eclipse. So it may be a nice at some point to add this to the Eclipse installation instructions.  Can't recall if your organization provided the installation instructions or if a link in your installation instructions took me to a place that missed this dependency. But in any case, it appears to at least initialize OK now. I've got some unit testing to complete before I know that it will train ok, but thanks for your helping me which in retrospect is a blinding flash of the obvious. I should have checked this out immediately.  Sorry to bother. 
solution: 1) Agreed. But I'm under a serious time crunch and all my other code is in Eclipse. Right now I'm just shooting for the shortest path to achieve a short-term goal. I am going to check out converting to IntelliJ, but not immediately. Thanks for the tip.. 

issue: I wrote some code to perform cross validation. Pass in the k folds and call train and on completion the mean and std error can be retrieved. Can someone please glance over the code to check if it looks alright? [<-LINK->] 
solution: also, looks like you might be re-using the model for different folds... should be training the network from random parameters k times, for k folds. 

issue: Sorry, I was a bit vague :P What data are you exporting@wmeddie? And when you say to make a graph to you mean a ROC curve? 
solution: Yeah, run the validation set through the network, gather the  labels and output into a CSV, and then plot them in R.  I use rxRoc but you could use ROCR or pROC too.. 

issue: wmeddie: not yet, but in principle it could. it can in theory optimize any real-valued measure 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: Can you help with my question? I am writing my term paper, and I would appreciate your help, Thx! 
solution: I am asking here because I am using the word2vec of deeplearning4j.. Reading a little bit of google cientific article, I found about different solutions with feedforward and recurrent neural net. I did not find what is the implementation used in deeplearning4j, that is the reason of my question. Well, sorry any way... 

issue: groupFWIW I don't expect anything from anybody.  I appreciate whatever help I can get in this channel. I also try not to expect help from just dl4j platform developers, that's why I try to ask questions to the whole community. felipeburin: if I was a little more experienced I would even try to help you. 
solution: Not ideal but community  has grown nicely and expectations are set. Since most people usually need context. 

issue: would the median be differentiable though? I'm thinking probably not if it isn't differentiable, you can't use gradient descent 
solution: (well, RL might be a strategy for using non-differentiable loss functions, but that's a whole other area :)). 

issue: agibsonccc: is nd4s updated to 0.5? Getting CUDA working on spark is a slight pain though.  (If your still going to be using RDDs) 
solution: 

issue: I'm having a hard time visualizing and understanding tensorAlongDimension with 3 parameters on a 3d input.I found this image:https://files.gitter.im/AlexDBlack/8JPJ/tensorAlongDimension.pngAnd that makes sense, but when I see a loop like the one in LSTMHelpers.java, I'm lost.Concretely, input.tensorAlongDimension(time, 1, 0). Suppose that time is from 0 to 2, that will give me (0,1,0), (1,1,0), (2,1,0).  Are these 2d? 
solution: 

issue: So, if I have those 3x2x2, moving along (0,1,0),(1,1,0),(2,1,0) will give me the 2x2 matrix of each time step? 
solution: 

issue: Let's see. If I have a 3x2x4 and I do tad(i,0,1) I will get 3x4 matrices? tad(i,1,0) will give me 2x4 matrices is this correct? (taking notes while typing, sorry for the late replies)

solution: 

issue: I'm seeing much slower performance with GPU compared to  CPU in DL4J 0.5.0.  I first experienced this with my laptop and chalked it up to the poor graphics card (GeForce GT 650M). However, I'm now testing with a GeForce GTX 980 Ti and seeing similar results. Anything I can do to nail down the issue?  [<-LINK->]

Does someone have an idea, what is wrong? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: still working up the issue. Quick question: is there a way to runcudaProfilerStop()orcuProfilerStop()via ND4J? bummer. I can't seem to get nvvp to reliably record profile data without that. I'm using sbt/intellij rather than maven/eclipse, so there's some overhead that I hope to avoid.

(actually, nevermind I answered my own question) 
solution: 

issue: no, paragraph vectors are not really supervised. existing labels are just optional so if you want - you might use inference with paravec, and compare vectors directly on sentence-paragraph level they should give you meaningful results 
solution: 

issue: Any ETA on when you think 0.6.0 will be available on maven?  (not looking for a commitment, just an rough estimate - next week, next month...) 
solution: no problem, I thought maybe you hadn't delivered it yet. Can you let me know the name of the example file, so I can look it up later when it becomes available. 

issue: Hi Guys, i'm trying to train a network using CUDA, but it instantly crashes with # A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment. Any ideas? I'm using a GTX 770 with the nd4j-cuda-7.5 backend  [<-LINK->] what is the deviceQuery output? 
solution: deviceQuery is one of the samples, shipped with CUDA toolkit you had installed earlier. 

issue: which video card are you using? If you are using the nd4j-cuda-7.5 backend, it won't work on the new GTX 10 series graphics card 
solution: 

issue: gowthamnatarajan: hey, sorry no I won't contribute anymore to rl4j, my internship has ended 
solution: I will begin using it next week probably. 

issue: mmh, so, why do you get the impression that the driver, as opposed to the executor, can't be a fork of Spark ? 
solution: D15 V2. 

issue: I'm a hobbyist ArchLinux package maintainer. A linux distro so bleeding edge it could be called hemophiliac. My usual problem is cuda doesn't support my gcc 5.4.0. Then I go work and suddenly I am transported in the world of 2012 . Where systemd and containers didn't exist, and the easiest way to ship complex setups to a cluster is Packer – when you're lucky enought to virtualize. it's quite romantic, really :) 
solution: 

issue: Hi do you have a log of what is new in 0.6.0? thank you 
solution: 

issue: plus honestly, if they merge [<-ISSUE->] and [<-ISSUE->] , it's only rightful that they should merge any changes you implement so that the driver can run with GPU enabled. Simple good sense

issue: Hi everyone, I am a newbie to dl4j,  and I was trying to run the example classorg.deeplearning4j.examples.feedforward.classification.MLPClassifierLinear,  it raised an FileNotFoundException, (~/Desktop/gitHub/dl4j-examples/dl4j-examples/dl4j-examples/src/main/resources/classification/linear_data_train.csv). Where could I get these data files ? just right click the source file in Eclipse and choose run as Java Application 
solution: 

issue: How are you running it?  [<-LINK->] The files should be in there  [<-LINK->] You must have did something wrong when you cloned? They're in there if eclipse is complaining then that's your problem not ours the files are in there they're not missing 
solution: 

issue: Interesting ideas here actually I actually like having an opposing view point Part of the reason we use maven is because we know the bad stuff and can work around it I actually learned a lot from the spark stuff too I didn't know about the internal sbt stuff they were doing That might be a path to us using grale or something else at some point 
solution: 

issue: RL4J looks fascinating. And overwhelming. Any value in me trying to get the [<-LINK->] working inside the [<-LINK->] ? One at a time, starting with the cartpole? 
solution: 

issue: sounds a bit off... only would make sense (a) later in the network (i.e., it's depth), or (b) for non-image data or 'examples' was intended 
solution: 

issue: stupid question: which libraryDependency is needed for the org.deeplearning4j.nn.conf.layers._ ? I am just so far declaring the need for the core.. hmm, thats odd ...I have declared "0.0.3.2.7" 
solution: 

issue: Maybe one of my colleagues reached out? 
solution: but mixing code from 2 years ago with stuff built today flat out wont ever work. 

issue: I see that my testing with schema-stuff works when I use that old core-dependency ("0.0.3.2.7") versus ("0.6.0"). 
solution: 

issue: i can't think of any case, where old codebase would be better then current one :( 
solution:

issue: Hi I have a question. If I train the network on my Thinkpad with an Nvidia 940M and I edit the pom.xml to use gpu, why my cpu use is at 100%? 
solution: sounds like things might not be configured correctly... have you checked nvidia smi (or say gpu-z if you are on windows) to see if your gpu is actually being used?. 

issue: 'Morning! What 'jackson.dataformat' dependency do I need to use to run the cartpole example? Kay, I'll get back to you if I figure it out 
solution: 

issue: Is there a documented example of using ParallelWrapper (or the like) with ParagraphVectors? Looked around and didn't see anything. If running on GPU it will automatically parallelize? 
solution: current word2vec and paravec implementations are not suited for GPUs, sorry. 

issue: I see from the A3C paper that Google used CPUs instead of GPUs to train, but I'm not sure why (still reading).  Does the rl4j A3C work on GPUs? 
solution: 

issue: Hello group. Per [ [<-LINK->] ]  I am trying to sanity check my setup and DataIterator. I should be able to get my loss to 0 by overfitting very few training examples. Using a two layer input->128 hidden (BLSTM) and then 128->2 (Out). All regularization turned off. Using 16 training examples. It is taking nearly 1000 epochs to get the loss down to 0.001. This doesn't feel right. raver119: Will do. That is absurdly slow, though, right? 
solution: 

issue: Opened as [<-ISSUE->] , not sure if I annotate it as a simple question or that is something you do. Certainly not trying to claim there is a bug here with anything besides myself 
solution: 

issue: Hello, why is it recommended to use normalized inputs to RBMs? Can't one just use softmax visible layer at first RBM?

solution: 

issue: cd C:\\Users\\Anand\\Documents\\NetBeansProjects\\dl4j-0.4-examples\\dl4j-examples <- It’s running in the wrong directory Probably needs to run inside dl4j-0.4-examples? (Assuming dl4j-0.4-examples is the git clone root) 
solution: It’s Netbeans being smart.  Which is fine, you just have to update the source to use the right directory.  It’s expecting to be run from the root.. 

issue: I noticed that my RecordReader pulls in the data correctly but once its loaded into the RecordReaderDataSetIterator it converts all of my labels to 1.0 when they can be 0 or 1 and they are at the first index, I defined my RecordReaderDataSetIterator(rr,batchsize,0,1) Line 170 of RecordReaderDataSetIterator states "label = FeatureUtil.toOutcomeVector(curr, numPossibleLabels);" where curr is whatever my current label is, in this cause it\'s loaded from the csv as 0, and then if you look at FeatureUtil.toOutcomeVector line 38 it assumes its an index 
solution: gotcha, i was so happy cause i was gettin 100% accuracy lol. AlexDBlack: that fixed that but it seems to be loading 2 columns for my labels even though i specified labelIndex  = 0 and numPossibleLabels = 1. 

issue: will the changes made in the git cloned files in my IDE reflected in the main git source from where i have cloned?

issue: Hello everyone. After searching on github, i found some reference to dl4j supporting spark ML (aka Dataframe API). But i can't find nothing in the javadoc or in official documentation. Is DL4J (still ?) capable of dealing with dataframe ? 
solution: 

issue: I'm not especially familiar with the RL4J codebase yet, unfortunately.@rubenfiszelwas the developer there 
solution: But what's your business plan? If dl4j is open-sourced, how do you make money?. 

issue: Right now I have a neural net that has a single output (label) and my spreadsheet has a column for it that are either 0's or 1's.  I am using the identity activation on the output layer with 1 outputs, it was recommended that I try the softmax output. How do I restructure my training set to handle that? Just add a second label that is the opposite of the first? it's getting mad that im specifying two outputs but dont have the two outputs in my training sets 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] check that very similar 3 classes vs your 2 last column here is the class [<-LINK->] 3 classes - values 0, 1 or 2 it'll convert it to a 1-hot representation... 0 -> [1,0] and 1 -> [0,1] which is suitable for softmax if you had 3 classes, it'd be [1,0,0], [0,1,0] or [0,0,1] 
solution: I'd step back for a second and learn the fundamentals on how to setup a problem a bit better. 

issue: I am using  build-dl4j-stack.sh to build the entire dl4j software stack, some errors as follows:Failed to execute goal on project canova-nd4j-image: Could not resolve dependencies for project org.nd4j:canova-nd4j-image:jar:0.0.0.18-SNAPSHOT: The following artifacts could not be resolved: org.bytedeco.javacpp-presets:opencv:jar:linux-mips64el:3.1.0-1.2, org.bytedeco.javacpp-presets:ffmpeg:jar:linux-mips64el:3.0.2-1.2, org.bytedeco.javacpp-presets:leptonica:jar:linux-mips64el:1.73-1.2: Failure to find org.bytedeco.javacpp-presets:opencv:jar:linux-mips64el:3.1.0-1.2 in [<-LINK->] was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of central has elapsed or updates are forced -> [Help 1] yech

solution: 

issue: I am trading binary options (investment instruments) and I have a lot of technical analysis algorithms that determine when a reversal in price is going to happen and then it throws out a rough idea if the reversal is going to be UP or DOWN. I am trying to then use a neural net to consume all my technical analysis indicators to determine if I should buy a CALL or PUT option Because my maths can only determine that a price reversal is going to occur it cant super accurately predict if its up or down, so im tryin out a neural network for that I figured i'd try out neural nets before moving on to random forests treo: lol well thats why I have crunched all the raw data to produce 160 features that are 'informative' :D I can with a 66% accuracy rate, I am trying to use the neural net to improve it further I already have an automated trading algorithm that spits out trades it wants to do, I just want the neural net to re-evaluate my trades and process all the side features to determine if it agrees with my CALL vs PUT assessment 
solution: in other words lets say I have an RSI indicator that might have indication parameters 30 means sell 70 means buy. This is a general rule of thumb that a neural net might be able to optimize based on a very specific currency pair. 

issue: Can anyone help point me to some information on how to get RNN's to work with Spark. I can only find documentation on MLP with Spark.  I imagined I should see at least a few more stages pop up, but the only way I could get the RNN to work with the spark wrappings is by using the getNetwork() command  with my SparkDl4jMultiLayer. I can't seem to find a way to properly use the feedworder or the rnnTimeStep commands within a SparkDl4jMultilayer.  I figured I could at least get each timestep to run with a spark cluster for some of the operations.

solution: 

issue: any cuda 8.0 support yet? 
solution: yep: [<-LINK->]. np :). 

issue: AlexDBlack: what do you mean the ratio approach, the article you linked described the ratio for parameters, when you say parameters are you referring to features essentially? 
solution: I mean "Using the mean magnitudes over time graphs: (bottom right)" "For tuning the learning rate, the ratio of parameters to updates for a layer should be somewhere in the order of 1000:1 - but note that is a rough guide only, and may not be appropriate for all networks. It’s often a good starting point, however."as in I usually start by increasing or decreasing learning rate until I get approximately that ratio. 

issue: Is there any information on seed tuning?  Or is that considered bad practice since the net should converge regardless of the seed value?  I ran a randomizer on my seed and noticed it makes a pretty substantial difference in the results F1 can go from .3 to .8 with the right seed 
solution: it's a mechanic of random number generators not specific at all to deep learning. 

issue: you mean when you work with w2v? or do you mean if you can use dl4j in anything other than java? If you understand what you are doing it should work for any language

issue: I'm running Lenet example with my data and ConvolutionalIterationListener.  The data has 3 classes (elephant, chair, balloon).  Often I see the small images in the 2nd layer output to be not matching the input image.  What I mean is, for the elephant input you can see Chair in the second layer.  Is this normal?  Also, what's the 3rd layer of images that are shown?  There are 5 of those, not sure what they correspond to. AlexDBlack: ok, i will.  is there a good sample screenshot of what to expect in the ConvolutionalIterationListener?  And also, shouldn't the final output be a label? logged issue.. [<-ISSUE->]

issue: Hi guys!I've tried to add a FlowIterationListener to my net but get a NoClassDefFoundError (org/glassfish/jersey/spi/ScheduledThreadPoolExecutorProvider).Am I missing a dependency in the pom file maybe? 
solution: no, probably you’ve got spare one. 

issue: what happens if/when you fit data on single gpu? 
solution: appears to run normally when using purely net.fit(). have you run it long enough?. I must admit it takes so long I've never completed one cycle. 

issue: I've managed to build locally before (e.g 0.5 ), but now when trying to build 0.6.1-SNAPSHOT I'm getting an error I haven't seen before when building libnd4j /Users/danlin/git/dl4j-local/libnd4j/include/pairwise_util.h:15:10: fatal error: 'omp.h' file not found anything obvious that has changed since 0.5 ? right, sierra a bad thing?

solution: 

issue: Do you have a suggestion for jointly optimizing the neural CRF? Since now we have the feature weights from CRF and also neural net parameters. The main training loop is contained in my CRF code. 
solution: been alongtime since I've looked at CRFs in any detail (and I never knew them that well back in the day)but basically, if you can calculate the gradient with respect to the parameters, the rest can be done by DL4J. 

issue: Hi a question about DataVec: does it allow to convert time series data in csv format to the svmlight output format? Also: I checked out the DataVec project but in general can't seem to find how you can transform data an a given input format into another output format.  Thought org.datavec.api.transform.TransformProcess would the main entry point for this, but it seems not. Any ideas? Thanks 
solution: take a look at the RecordWriters. TransformProcess is for things like filtering and removing columns.

issue: Hi, I\'m trying to get dl4j working on a spark cluster running a scala notebook, but I\'m having trouble figuring out how to convert my raw Spark SQL DataFrame into a DataSet.  The best I\'ve figured so far is using a org.apache.spark.ml.feature.VectorAssembler to make a "features" sparse Vector, then converting that to a LabelledPoint and then trying to map THAT into a DataSet, but that seemed like an overly-convoluted way to go.

solution: It is just when i train spark model it sets only syn0 but when i am trying to save the model using writeWord2Vec it tries to save full word2vec including syn0 and syn1 in lookuptable. But since syn1 is uninitialised, It is throwing NPE.. 

issue: manvendratomar: you are welcome to file an issue on your use case if we dont support it 
solution: that method just wast suited for spark, exactly due to syn1 absence. 

issue: 1) what you mean by train it online? please expand this term.2) file an issue, because it’s rather hard to understand what you’re doing there 
solution: It sounds like incremental uptraining. 

issue: Why does the 0.6.x version no longer support  hadoop? The 0.6.x version support spark, But I cannot find the hadoop plugin package

Should be quite straithforward 
solution: however, you can check that yourself. 

issue: ampopp04: no, you are seeing 299ms spent on the deallocator thread, which is 53 times less then the next one, which looks like it comes from loading data (I can't really tell though without the  call graph view) that's why I told you to sort bySelf Time (CPU) CPU i.e. the next column 
solution: right, now you see a better distribution of what actually takes time, still you would have to click on snapshot and take a look at the call graph to determine what is calling all that stuff. 

issue: raver119: the problem appears to be the RecordReaderDataSetIterator .next method. I'll try to load my entire dataset into memory once and then not iterate over it and use it as a whole to train each epoch its spending all of its time on the toDouble method while parsing for the next call 
solution: 365 columns (features), by 20,000 rows. that's odd... that shouldn't take longer than a second.

solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: is there much of a performance difference between running it on windows 10 vs ubuntu? 
solution: for cuda difference comes from drivers model and for cpu from better math library in modern linux distros.

issue: I'm trying to get dl4j running on my own private project but when I transferred the poms and dependencies over everything works except the HistrogramIterationListener pops up the window but says theres no active sessions wasn't sure if this was something obvious 
solution: 

issue: Hi, thx for all the help in here! I would have a question regarding the FlowIterationListener.Is it bad if the the score vs. iteration plot does not show a more-or-less consistent/linear drop, but rather a power law function ?Something likes this: ok, thx! 
solution: 

issue: I've attached a histogram listener to my model. But when I'm visiting the local weight page it says no data found. Any suggestions? 
solution: so it has 4 real cores. and 4 cores are used. 

issue: Hyperthreads work by having two threads share the ALU.  There's only a speedup if one thread is waiting on memory while the other thread uses the ALU.  DL4J is optimized enough that it's always using the ALU.  So the other thread is always just waiting 
solution: and with 99% chance you'll see that performance go down. 

issue: I guess what I am confused about is why I've seen 90% utilization across the board on my 40 core aws instance but only 50% on my 4 core instance running the same models granted that aws instance was running a random grid search so maybe that is more parallelized 
solution: I don't think AWS exposes hyperthreads.. aws exposes hyperthreads :(. i've personally checked that, and confirmed the same performance dropdowns for dl4j and caffe. 

issue: is it generally better for me to spin up a single 40 core instance or 10 four core instances and be distributed? I'd assume the single instance because of all the virtualization 
solution: aws 32 core instance. 

issue: Are there any providers that actually let me simply rent CPU cores? When I was working at my investment firm they'd just give me 400 virtual cores that mapped to real cores under the covers and I'd run my simulations, I don't need all the extra ram and disk space from aws

solution: 

issue: ND4j implementation question for you guys: when you really big matrix ops that are essentially just flat array ops, do you do anything with the kernel/block sizes, or do you just set your global work size to the size of the matrix and let the GPU figure it out? 
solution: 

issue: I am running a dl4j based app on an Amazon Linux AMI with NVIDIA GRID GPU Driver node and get ajava.lang.IllegalStateException: MemcpyAsync H2H failed(see [<-LINK->] ). It works fine with native - Any ideas? OK - filing ... OK raver119: @raver120see [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: and i need nn conf that reproduces this crash.

issue: Hi, i am new to deep learning 4j. Someone was already using the deeplearning4j  at my workplace. As I just joined so I downloaded the latest package and started using it. But if I try to use the paragraph vector created by earlier version, I am not able to classify using it in my new version. I get some zip file error. Can someone help me out with this issue? is this related to version or some parameters being set while creating paragraph vector. AlexDBlack: @raver120Please find the error here... [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: @rahulahuja16can you please show me the java code that reproduces your error? 
solution: 

issue: is there accompanying code with Michael's book?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: alright so basically, if I want to replicate results from research papers ==> use Python, if I'm a finance firm, ==> use deeplearning4j ? 
solution: if you want it to run once and forget - use python. if you want to use results in production environment - stay away from python.. that question is usually followed by old good holywar. 

issue: no, at the moment you can only load a single backend at a time 
solution: 

issue: dlnntour: most startups start with python Like I said before we're likely not your stack 
solution: podludek: general rule is simple: it's better to launch inefficient kernel, then copy  gpu->host->gpu. 

issue: Can someone help me find the architecture of the neural network used to build the word2vec model  in deeplearning4j? ( I have implemented it using the library and need the architecture diagram for a paper that I am writing) 
solution: vin101: google. 

issue: When I try to normalize my data using NormalizerMinMaxScaler instead of NormalizerStandardize I get 'mismatched shapes' exception . Here's the same error reproduced with the UCISequenceClassificationExample: [<-LINK->] Is there any obvious reason for this that I'm missing?

solution: 

issue: dgkris: usual mistake there is wrong place to expose env vars make sure it’s in .profile, and not in .bash_rc 
solution: bash_profile on osx, bashrc on linux. 

issue: JLeavell: @agibsonccc@raver119Hi, I am new here. I have tried to run an older lfw face recognition example after porting it to the latest code. But I get an accuracy of 0.002 after using the training data as the test data. Anyone have a better experience with face recognition? agibsonccc: Thanks! I used that pointer. agibsonccc: My code is on gist. Can you take a quick look at it? 
solution: It diverges really easily otherwise. 

issue: agibsonccc: Where do I put the ImageNormalizer? I will need some pointers. xae217: I am trying to get somewhere with face recognition myself. But here's something I used to get started. Hope it helps. [<-LINK->] agibsonccc: I thought of putting it as a transform in recordReader.initialize but its not compatible with current code. 
solution: 

issue: Hi all, I am looking to implement google's FaceNet ( [<-LINK->] )  in the dl4j framework but I was wondering if anyone has done something similar? If not could anyone give me some tips to get me started? 
solution: 

issue: Anyone knows about a concrete project that used deeplearning4j, I need examples for my thesis and I can't find much online. 
solution: 

issue: Q: Is self-organizing Kohonen maps are deep learning? those, instead they should use a deep belief? 
solution: or autoencoders. 

issue: is there a list somewhere of projects that use deeplearning4j (companies that publicly state that they are using deeeplearning4j,) 
solution: 

issue: Anyone getting high benchmarks with LFW faces using dl4j or ComputerVision-examples? 
solution: 

issue: hi :) do we have any example on word2vec or paragraph2vec on spark? probably this should work... [<-LINK->] :) As I understand paragraph2vec is not implemented on Spark at the moment? 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys, could you suggest what should I put in project version??<dependency>         <groupId>org.deeplearning4j</groupId>          <artifactId>dl4j-test-resources</artifactId>          <version>${project.version}</version>          <scope>test</scope> </dependency> Yeah.. I get that, it's for Running Unit tests, and that's what I'm after If i clone, & My maven in IntelliJ downloads it, isn't that enough? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I\'m trying to run the DeepAutoEncoderExample.java but got : Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Unknown or not supported loss function: RMSE_XENTat org.nd4j.linalg.lossfunctions.LossFunctions$LossFunction.getILossFunction(LossFunctions.java:128) 
solution: 

issue: keskella: Remember DL4J is targeting Java developers.  They don’t have the luxury of the beautiful scala collections libraries.  For them DataVec stuff is pretty good. 
solution: 

issue: have you restarted your IDE since installing cuda? if you want it to pick up env variable changes you have to restart it 
solution: It’s an easy thing to forget. Your old terminals all have old PATHs.. 

issue: yeah, I uninstalled and reinstalled various versions of CUDAs because I tried to install theano (and failed) before I went to d4j now I'm getting yet another error.. [<-LINK->] just a sec. 
solution: 

issue: well, is there proper example of deep belief network that also uses the GPU well? (in d4j) 
solution: there isn't even a proper example of a deep belief network :P (take a look at the note on top). we're not creating example to show gpu performance. 

issue: hello. I have  a question on the textbook. Am I correct that it covers both deeplearning in general, as well as a comprehensive guide of using deeplearning4j? And is the current version already fully up to speed? Or will the final book be more exhaustive? 
solution: 

issue: Sorry to trouble again, but I was following https://github.com/deeplearning4j/libnd4j/blob/master/windows.md and was trying to run this [<-CODE->] And I get the following error : [<-CODE->]  [<-LINK->] raver119: thanks for pointing that out... Won't repeat that 
solution: no sense fighting conflicts there. 

issue: What is t he best way (for a practicioner, i.e., newbie) to solve such error exceptions? Post here, or can i find answers elsewhere? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] i built my spark-dl4j project in win7, and put the jar to the spark cluster in centos server, it printed like this.but the jar package can run normally when i built it in a other centos system. i tried the method in the bottom of [<-LINK->] . but it seems did not work.   i would try soon should i add <classifier> for nd4j dependency? 
solution: no, you should use the nd4j-native-platform artifact. 

issue: Cool, got the algorithm up and running. I had to change the numer of input measures. Now I really need the book to interpret the results :) Test set evaluation at epoch 5: Accuracy = 0,98, F1 = 0,28 
solution: it usually takes some epochs and quite a bit of network tuning until you get something useful, so it looks like it isn't that bad. 

issue: Anyone getting high benchmarks with LFW faces using dl4j or ComputerVision-examples? 
solution: 

issue: I get a CUDA error at cudaStreamSynchronize when trying to run using CUDA."Full" stack trace is here [<-LINK->] raver119:  [<-LINK->] raver119: sorry :) [<-LINK->] Should be 200

issue: So I am getting started with CNNs. In the example provided, are the layers connected "in series" meaning:layer0->layer1->layer2->...->outpulayer? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: is there anything you can suggest I try regarding [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: can someone tell me how to reconstruct an RBM output to the RBM input? I can\'t see any such function in "Layer" or "RBM", such function exists in "MultiLayerNetwork" but it doesn\'t seem to work. I\'m getting an error there. I also searched aand couldn't find any examples how to do this in google :-( when I'm typing org.deeplearning4j.nn. I can't see that RBM class exists... but it's not the same as this one   it seems [<-LINK->] oh :-) so it's org.deeplearning4j.nn.layers.feedforward.rbm;... 
solution: 

issue: mind opening an issue on dl4j? the RNG stuff and implementation shouldn't be that hard to add, but the different train/test behaviour doesn't quite fit the API currently again, not too hard for us to add 
solution: 

issue: I could see new examples on convolution (eg. CNNLFWExample.java) in github, that is not in my dl4j examples folder.. How do i get that file? 
solution: 

issue: Is there a good reference to getting GPUs working with 0.5.0 ? 
solution: change nd4j-native-platform dependency.

issue: claytantor: nice work. I've only glanced at it. Will take a closer look this week and send feedback. 
solution: 

issue: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Color parameter outside of expected range: Red Green Blue  is it because ConvolutionalIterationListener no supporting RGB channels? can anyone tell me if i am right? 1. create and initialize ImageRecordReader 2. create DataSetIterator 3. model.fit(DataSetIterator)      is this work for training the model or i have to do some more? 
solution: 

issue: Did you normalize the data? ImageRecordReader recordReader = new ImageRecordReader(height,width,nChannels,labelMaker, 256); This helped in my case. (Line 78) 
solution: 

issue: Up until now, I've been using my CPU to train my NNs. I have a NVIDIA Geforce GTX 960 - would it be quicker to use this GPU? 
solution: 

issue: Does ComputationalGraph model support GPU?  I have a CG model that works on CPU but when I modify the code to use GPU, it seems to hang when it goes into model.fit(). agibsonccc: So, I guess it is safe to say that if I got the dl4j-cuda-specific-examples to work on my h/w, 'everything else' should work with the GPU as well? I've been busy watching football :) .  I just picked up the code again 5 minutes ago and am reviewing it against the cuda-example to see if I've done something wrong. 
solution: 

issue: new error popped up Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Invalid input configuration (layer name = "null") for height: inHeight=19, kernelH=2, padH=0, strideH=2; (19-2+2*0)/2 is not an integer      this is for implementing .setInputType(InputType.convolutional(height,width,depth)) ok appreciate thanks

issue: Infrastructure planning question: If you had production GPU use cases (using Tesla K80s), and a dual-10 core / 256GB machine, how many GPUs would you add per box? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: Have you merged [<-ISSUE->] into master? 
solution: Prechtig: yes. 

issue: Sweet. Is it compiled into a new version on maven or still under 0.6.0? 
solution: 

issue: I tried copying ur example with my dataset and i still get the same error. The only difference i find is that ur DatasetIterator has 10 output numbers for classes, while mine does not. So to get an unsupervised version, i'll have to manually insert the decoder part? 
solution: 

issue: when do you expect 0.6.1 on maven? 
solution: soon™. I was expecting this. :D. 

issue: seiyaa: android support is still something we are working on [<-ISSUE->] in theory, you can do it now, if you build from source (but: no release on maven central - yet)but be warned: android support is still very early and isn't thoroughly tested. could be bugs, etc anandkoirala: it should give you updates every iteration, with nIterations set to 1 like that I've used it a ton, and never had any issues with it... 
solution: 

issue: So I'm trying to train a convnet for the first time and apparently I'm doing something wrong. When testing, non of the classes are ever predicted, which seems wierd. This is the output I'm seeing: [<-LINK->] sure, I'll try, however right now github is saying there are no servers available to process my request :S actually can't reach github at all atm kepricon: I've updated the gist now  [<-LINK->] I've basically tried to combine the ImagePipeline and Lenet examples with some modifications

issue: When setting cudaenvironment properties, what are the difference between device and host? When setting cudaenvironment memory properties, what are the difference between device and host? 
solution: So device memory is GPU memory? Is this per device or in total, e.g. 12G or 24G for two titans?. 

issue: manvendratomar: all good :)so that's compute capability 3.5 I think, so shouldn't be too old...can you post the full error you are getting in a !gist? thanks 
solution: sid-sahani: F1 score is calculated as the harmonic mean of the precision and recall.. 

issue: Guys training a word2Vec model with just 1000 tweets and it is too slow. Can anyone help@AlexDBlack [<-LINK->] is it only with this version? 0.6.0 
solution: no. raver119: so is it safe to use rc3.8 for word2vec on GPU?. 

issue: why negative sample to 0? raver119: 
solution: negativeSample adds you additional iterations during training. Still it if i won't do negative sampling, it will affect  my results. 

issue: with ImageRecordReader? you should just be able to call getLabels() on that yeah, that should work. or recordReader.getLabels() 
solution: 

issue: I am experimenting ImagePipelineExample of DL4J-examples. It seems that ShowImageTransform always displaying the original images, instead of transformed 50x50 images. Is this true? And then the comments in the codes are not very accurate? agibsonccc: Filed. Thanks. 
solution: 

issue: JieZou1: mind filing an !issue ? !issues 
solution: 

issue: JavaFXpert: that's due to a minor issue with DataSet.shuffle, not being sufficiently random (when source data is ordered, like iris). that fix will be merged to master soon, and will be in next releaseone workaround is to manually shuffle the data AlexKershaw: we don't have any feature selection functionality built in to dl4j (yet) 
solution: 

issue: Is anybody here is attending the Nvidia GPU Tech conference in Tokyo? Totally wish I could go, but the spousal unit would not approve. To NIPS 
solution: 

issue: how did you make jar using mvn? mvn clean package -DskipTests can be a way to make uber jar. i recommend this documentation( [<-LINK->] ) 
solution: 

issue: Are there any performance numbers of dl4j vs some other framework (like TF) i am trying to run a simple CNN, and it is taking a lifetime any pointers to speed it up will be appreciated 
solution: You haven't given us batch sizes or anything to work with. 

issue: What's the right way to  reference latest 0.6.1-SNAPSHOT of deeplearning4j? I use scala, and have the following in build.sbt: [<-CODE->] Do I still need the classifiers while referencing the -platform jars? 
solution: 

issue: Please tell me if we can save trained network in JSON format or not? 
solution: 

issue: akhodakivskiy: re: logging, we don't bundle logback anymore. still have slf4j though... adds an extra step, but is arguably better practice (i.e., should be up to the user to decide what logging library to use) check the examples, there's logback added there sid-sahani: no, our RBM examples definitely need work. hasn't been a priority 
solution: 

issue: Ohhh !!@AlexDBlackSince my CNNs aren't giving Results in high 90s, do you recommend RNNs for NLP tasks? (I'm on an experimenting spree) 
solution: Alright, I've seen that example. Will give it a shot, but would need to understand its concept first. I did know about RBMs though. BTW, can I file an Issue for provision of an RBM example, or provide the code I used and the error I'm stuck at?. lack of RBM examples is a known issue. they aren't used very widely anymore (and can be difficult to tune) which is why we haven't got to it yet. 

issue: nyghtowl: I can't find that new AMI with DL4j. All I can find is this one: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Trying to use HistogramIterationListener on the latest snapshot, getting this error: Template "/org/deeplearning4j/ui/weights/weights.ftl" not found. Does the UiServer work for you guys in the latest snapshot? It can't find any ftl templates on my end 
solution: AlexDBlack: Due to another pom.xml issue  you local UI jar might have been stale. 

issue: If I\'m seeing a lot of "Score at iteration 0 is NaN", what could be possible reasons? Too little data? 
solution: 

issue: dan-lind: could be many different things. Check your data. Is it normalized? Also scroll through the tuning channel which will have a lot of info on this. 
solution: 

issue: huitseeker: it's a SNAPSHOT version though, can't be strict in a meaningful way AFAIK ? Not sure what that error is about either 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlac: , can you comment on my query? 
solution: gks141270: can't use it in javascript, but you can set up a REST server and query it from javascriptthat's outside of the scope of DL4J (at least the open source stuff :)). Alex, I also thought of having REST server, but I thought if I can load trained network in javascript somehow. Anyway, thanks for the confirmation.. 

issue: Hey @AlexDBlack, I was going through your SentimentExampleIterator code for Word2VecSentimentRNN, and can't get what happens in the following: [<-CODE->] I specifically don't understand this bit : [<-CODE->] I've a separate Code for pre-processing, where i do majority of all what you've done, Tokenize -> remove words not in GoogleVec -> Fetch embeddings for each word present& so my data is in the form: Rows represent- Sentences & they have Tokens(truncated to 200) x GoogleWordEmbedding'sSize(300)Lemme if I could use it directly, the way I was using with DataSetIterator for CNNs, if the part that i suspect is not doing something else.

issue: Good day! I have sigmoid output layer with 2 outputs - to make binary classification. What is it better to use as loss: LossFunction.MCXENT or LossFunction.NEGATIVELOGLIKELIHOOD? someonedeep: first try to change learningRate, if it does not help - increase network capacity 
solution: 

issue: softmax@AlexSerbul_twitter not sigmoid And mcxent and neg log likelihood are equivalent mathematically 
solution: 

issue: hello, is it possible to change training parameters during training (learning rate, algorithms) etc in DL4J? oops, sorry, I messed up in the last chat, I mean during training. I am not sure what I am looking for. I am playing with a modified binary classification problem with fully connected network, but the training rate seems to be too low after some epoches. 
solution: 

issue: How can I answer a question that has an undefined answer? You shouldn't have any reason to change the config during training If you want to try a parameter search look at arbiter 
solution: I was trying a simple experiment to complete a 2-class classification training of image patches.. 

issue: However, it is a little surprising to me. GPU training is essential for image related DL. I am basically just copying from the examples. I am also just using a common platform: Win7+Intellj+Maven. Nobody faced this issue before? 
solution: JieZou1: can you please show your pom.xml as !gist. 

issue: good evening, does anyone know where MLPMnistSingleLayerExample class loads the data from?  I've looked through the examples project and can't find it ahhh... ok that explains why I can't find any png or jpg files haha... I was gonna swap out the sample with my aweful hand writing for kicks since my hand writing looks more like scribbles on beach sand than actual letters or numbers thanks.. I will try imagePipelineExample once I get that running, I can move on to my robot tag project, thanks Nice to meet you Adam, you guys work late :) 
solution: You sound new. You might like our oreilly book: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: agibsonccc: It's possible users are importing other modules that depend on an older version of JavaCPP, and Maven decides to use that old version 
solution: not cpu though. This channel tells us what else we're missing. as well as bug reports among other things. 

issue: rave120: Hi, I am looking forward to contribute to lib via python raver120: Hi, I am looking forward to contribute to lib via python 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] I\'m running my model in "production mode" - i.e. evaluating some data Is this normal that some javacpp deallocator stuff uses 70% of CPU time? Yeah, it's a lot of single allocations, like 500 doulbes at a times Can't really batch it that much... Is it hard to implement pure Java backend? Will it be much faster? Btw this app is run on native backend, not cuda 
solution: 

issue: Right, are you sure it's not trying to run System.gc() all the time because it's always low on memory? 
solution: 

issue: It's possible, I am not familiar with the kernel internals when checking a process memory usage, but I can't imagine it would block for long Hum, try to set the system property "org.bytedeco.javacpp.maxphysicalbytes" to 0 to disable that check So, I guess there is a problem with that with some kernels... 
solution: 

issue: treo: allocations for ND4J (actually primitive native arrays) are already track separately, checkPointer.totalBytes()and such Does that even work? 
solution: butit looks like it does work when using open/lseek/close instead if fopen/rewind/fclose. 

issue: I'd have to check the literature again... been a while since I've looked at it(and I'm heading off now - after midnight here) 
solution: 

issue: I\'m trying to normalize a dataset for my convnet, but getting "Mismatched shapes (shape = [18, 3, 100, 100], row vector shape =[3, 100, 100])" Is there some special normalizer i need to use for images? 
solution: bnsh: I can fix it in master but if you want to make a PR with the flag changed I'll merge it.. 

issue: Um... Unfortunately I\'m woefully ill-versed in open source methodology... But, it\'s saying "Failed Tests: 287"... Surely that\'s not because of the change from false to true? 
solution: fine, and merged :D. medinamanuel: use that ^^. 

issue: Do you guys have delivery estimate for the refactoring of all the GUI stuff? I'm running of the snapshot because there are a few bugs I must avoid in 0.6 
solution: akhodakivskiy: soon™. then*. 

issue: What is the module <deeplearning4j-graph> working for? 
solution: deepwalk. however, there's pretty much similar impl available in dl4j-nlp via transformers. 

issue: is that with version 0.6.0? and is that the exact exception you are getting? 
solution: thx a lot.. 

issue: gewoonrik: you can just issue a pull request against the gh-pages branch with a warning about it 
solution: 

issue: Any guideline for POM.xml editing? I am going to import DL4J library with Maven, into an existing project. Thanks. 
solution: start with the examples poms, though the multi-module stuff there can make things a bit more complicated to understandthe basics are deeplearning4j-core and a nd4j backend (nd4j-native-platform for cpu). you'll probably need to write a bit of code to wire things together... we haven't got functionality (or, docs) built out for cassandra yet. 

issue: what shape/type is the data (images? time series?) 
solution: it will take into account that it's a time series, and mean/std.dev will be collected over all time steps.

issue: Hey, I'm getting started with nd4j-native-platform v0.6.0, and I'm experiencing some unexpected behavior when callingmyArr.getColumn(0).data().asDouble(). Specifically, all of the data within the INDArray is returned instead of only the data in the first column. However,  the same command for the other indices does return only the data for the specified column. Is this a bug or is there another way to access only the data within the first column?

issue: Hello all, I've run into a problem using deeplearning4j  with CUDA and wanted to see if anyone here knew of any work arounds The be succinct, I'm really only trying to load Google's WordVectors model using Deeplearning4j When I run it using the native-backend, everything goes swimmingly However, when I run it using the CUDA backend, I run intojava.lang.RuntimeException: Can't allocate [HOST] memory: 3600000000 I think this is expected, as I'm pretty sure CUDA can't allocate more than 2GB of memory, I'm just wondering if anyone knows of any workarounds for this Windows 10 
solution: 

issue: Mocuto: Welcome! Here's a link to Deeplearning4j's Gitter Guidelines, our documentation and other DeepLearning resources online. Please explore these and enjoy! [<-LINK->]

solution:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Thank you very much, how can I specify my labels if they are vectors? And is there any way that I can specify my own loss function? 
solution: as for labels: assuming you are doing regression, use this constructor (line 107) [<-LINK->]. marapapman: balanced batches with classes matter more. Usually 100 or 1000 is good for small problems. 

issue: I'm reading through ImagePipelineExample and was able to run it this morning unlike MLPMnistSingleLayerExample, the ImagePipelineExample just does some transformations. Is there another example that does MNIST aside from MLPMnistTwoLayerExample thanks... I found it looks like all 3 examples for MNIST uses the same mnist binary dataset, instead of jpg/png files... I'll write one using the images from the ImagePipeline

issue: AlexDBlack: for the xor network, more general than just dl4j, is it necessary to have two outputs? Why can one not use a sigmoid activation function and binary cross entropy as a loss function with only one output? That's what I thought... Is my logic incorrect here? [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: I haven't been following that discussion, let me take a look. 

issue: AlexDBlack: do you mind merging [<-ISSUE->] Thanks, I have an automated script that pulls master and doesn't include branch changes 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: since WordVectorSerializer.loadFullModel is deprecated, which method should I use instead ? dl4j 0.6 
solution: 

issue: Okie, I see.. I have also read some articles that seems to try solve my problem by "averaging" (taking mean) of all words in a sentence.  But I dont fully understand it. What are the uses of averaging all words in a setence (or just words in proximity to a word). ? 
solution: So this is just nonsense talk (from stackoverflow) to my problem: You could measure the similarity between the original sentence and the transformed sentences using the word2vec embeddings to generate a vector representation of each sentence. For example, you could have each sentence representation be the average of the word2vec embeddings for each of the individual words in the sentence. Then you could measure the cosine similarity between the two sentence representations. The sentence with the largest cosine similarity to the original sentence might capture the property you are interested in..

solution: 

issue: Does setting a group ID version and omitting the artifactID in dependency management force all artifacts for a group to use that version? oh wait. it complains. 
solution: I do have a couple other questions. I have a bunch of examples in data without a list of what labels will exist (I know it's a finite set), so I made a lazy counter that parses through the data, creates a set for each feature column that's a list of possible labels... I then turn the string into a category in a transform after converting the Set to a List.How would I then load the resulting JavaRDD<List<Writable>>  after that transformation into an nd4j array (or into a DataSetIterator)? Or do I have to do a further transform to get the categories into int or onehot configs?Or is there a tool to do this and I'm approaching this in a dumb way....

solution: 

issue: how should I deal with error values? Like sometimes the sensor reports an error code, should I just disregard that timestep completely, or have it use its output from the previous step? 
solution: I also feed in a timestamp component, wouldn't the network be confused when it sees a sudden jump in time? Normally it sees data at 5min intervals. 

issue: qiguangyang: any reason you're compiling from source? You don't need to do that 
solution: 

issue: If I have my data stored in a database and do not want to use file paths as a key for each item in a dataset are there any good starting places for that.? The image pipeline example works on files and I am looking to abstract that a bit. It like its very tied to file paths and I didnt really plan to do things that way. I guess I could though... 
solution: 

issue: couple of ways you could approach that: build a RecordReader that does the reading from the databaseor, export it to something like CSV firstI'd recommend the latter if you can - you don't want to be reading from your database multiple times (or waiting for queries to run) - in most cases you are going to be doing multiple passes over your data when training a neural network 
solution: 

issue: you can delete it now that it\'s merged - surefor later work, you can just update your local fork though... "git fetch upstream" followed by "git merge upstream/master" I think that'll sync your fork with whatever is on nd4j master

solution: 

issue: Hi Alex/Adam, i almost finished reading the (draft) book. How far along is the final version, and would you be interested in some (high-level) comments? okay, do you have an email i can send them to? Btw, I have tried many different network configs on my dataset, also including some of the hints from the book. Results are not that great, I expect that the dataset is too noisy. 
solution: So i have a timeseries with (noisy) sensory data. The timeeries  is at some points labeled by a human expert. The label indicates the start this labeled sequence, the end is unknown. Now, I simply take the next ten timesteps as inputs per sequence. Based on domain knowledge, I am almost certain that the timeseries should discriminate between classes. For example, if current X,Y is 10,10, then if the next is 12,12, then this should tell us something about the class. But are LSTMs capable of generalizing, i.e., does it also learn if the X, Y are 40,40 and next is 42,42?. 

issue: i met this problem [<-LINK->] and i have added those jars to the path [<-LINK->] i built my maven project in windows and submit the spark job on centos server

issue: hey guys, I just cloned the examples project and ran the examples, they run fine but I wonder if it would be nicer if they were made into tests so they could be more easily run/debug from within intellij You're right, I mostly write examples as tests but I get what you mean, but the run examples script can only be run on unix or cygwin I am new to this whole area, so please accept my apologies in advance if my questions are a bit basic :-)

solution: 

issue: I have to say, after a week of using tensorflow... I LOVE COMPILERS AND HIGHLY TYPED LANGUAGES (sorry for yelling), keep up the good work... its important. the issue is that as they upgrade all the old examples dont work, and there is no way to track it down because everything is weakly typed and no compiler is there to help you figure out what its wrong. The difference just between 9 an 11 broke typing all over the place and you just have to wanter through the weeds... I wont write my post here but know that making a java implementation for DL is very valuable.

issue: Hi all, I'm trying to use the WordVectorSerializer.loadGoogleModel() function on a file that is store in an Amazon s3 bucket using Java. Right now I'm reading the file from s3 into an InputStream, but the API for loadGoogleModel() only accepts a File. Is there a way for me to us that function without having to copy the file stored on s3 to a local file system? Do you know how java can do that for you? In my experience with python I've used their StringIO package to do this.

solution: 

issue: I remember you told me that in CNN you cant' handle decimals in filter sizes. But I actually wouldn't mind at all to lose information about borders of the image (I can use some zero padding so I just lose some zeroes).

issue: OssamaAlshabrawy: great, so at some point apparently your data doesn't have labels -- the error you are seeing is unrelated to your chosen loss function Still, what you are seeing isn't due to the loss function you have chosen, but because of something else OssamaAlshabrawy: I don't know where exactly it goes wrong for you, but your error comes from [<-LINK->] which means thatlabelsthere isnull that is not a warning, it is just a log message which tells you that your rbm is training during pertraining and as your batchsize is 256, it uses 256 elements at once for pretraining

issue: Am looking at SMAC for my own hyperparameter optimization (not NN) and possibly HPOlib - I remember you saying you have Spearmint, but a parallel version in your commercial offering . That isn't available on the normal (git) versions - is it something you have done yourself (obviously you have done a Java port) or based further work for the parallel aspect by Jasper Snoek ? 
solution: 

issue: that is precisely my line of thought. This library looks excellent for its UI. In fact I came across it when looking for ideas on how to debug my DBN. So you are suggesting theano is faster for development? It looks like I will be learning to program in Java in the near future then... I'm currently working on a research project with a tight deadline and theano's more general applications might be relevant in the job I'm starting in the next few weeks. I've favourited this library though and it looks like it has excellent docs and support

issue: define "learn continuously?" yeah that makes sense. if by learning continuously you mean online learning, you technically can do that (since training uses stochastic gradient descent, i.e., online gradient descent), but it's challenging to get that right ^^^^listen to this guy indeed. but i think if you're in a true online setting with nonstationary data, that is likely to be tricky. 
solution: 

issue: Hi All,I'm working on a template that shows how to use dl4j with Spark Cloudera CDH 5.8.x.During this job I was looking at APIs for converting RDD[LabeledPoint] => RDD[DataSet] and I noticed that dl4j uses collect for doing this conversion I wonder if it can be done fully in parallel, since using collect and then parallelize, means transferring all the data to the driver 
solution: If you're using scala you maybe interested in scalnet. 

issue: hi, does dl4j has POS tagging, dependency parsing, NER in its NLP module? Or, is there any plan to implement these functionalities in dl4j? I see. I am looking at TensorFlow's syntaxnet, and investigate the possibility to transplant it to dl4j. 
solution: If there's anything in that community point us at it. 

issue: Hey guys, what is the status of the UI stuff in master?  [<-ISSUE->] I'm experiencing this for a while now. So it's still in the progress? Is there something to play with? I'm pretty good at spotting bugs here and there :P lol ok Did you guys figure that Play is the best tool for the job? 
solution: 

issue: Is there any recommended paper for implementing POS, NER, etc.? besides the one implemented by syntaxnet

solution: 

issue: thanks@agibsonccc. Updating maven made it work. The message on the violated enfore-rule is actually quite a bit hidden by maven - I didn't see it 
solution: yeah, maven could make it more visible. I couldn't find a way to make it do that.

issue: hi, i'm trying to reach the bugfix for: [<-ISSUE->] however i'm having some trouble compiling dl4j... hmmm you're so responsive, that's nice, I actually got a java incorrect checksum for freed object error and supposed it was fixed in the latest version hmm ok wait a min that's when using dl4j-spark 
solution: 

issue: alexandre-a-denis: i highly doubt you was ever affected by this bug it was introduced long ago, but it wasn't possible to face it in practice before 0.6.1 hm. show me your source code that reproduces this issue hm. so, not on mac? 
solution: 

issue: that's half precision 16  bit floats not sure what you expected they're more tricky to tune that's what you get for precision that's the trade off you make is more tricky tuning or it diverges 
solution: 

issue: tasuk: Welcome! Here's a link to Deeplearning4j's Gitter Guidelines, our documentation and other DeepLearning resources online. Please explore these and enjoy! [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: one quick check. Does the LossFunction.MSE means the average square error for each sample (each neuron accumulated,i.e. for data (n x m, n sample size, m input dimension), sum(Avg(error for m) for n)) or the average of each neuron of each sample (Avg(Avg(error for m) for n))? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: You were right about glibc being a too old version - I have two nodes now at glibc 2.17, and it gets further (collect at Word2Vec.java:207), but now getting a different error: [<-LINK->] It looks like it got through word2vec.train(corpus), but then died when calling: Collection<String> lst = word2Vec.wordsNearest("obama", 10); Last error after a bunch of tasks died was: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerExceptionat org.deeplearning4j.models.embeddings.reader.impl.BasicModelUtils.wordsNearest(BasicModelUtils.java:161)at org.deeplearning4j.models.embeddings.reader.impl.BasicModelUtils.wordsNearest(BasicModelUtils.java:88)at org.deeplearning4j.models.embeddings.wordvectors.WordVectorsImpl.wordsNearest(WordVectorsImpl.java:246) the worker nodes have this error: [<-LINK->] sorry for the noob question - where do I file an issue? 
solution: 

issue: Is this a valid (up to date 0.6.0) example? [<-LINK->] 
solution: raver119: - I think the issue is in FirstIterationFunction.java where the function is trying to return an public Iterable<Entry<VocabWord, INDArray>>.  In Spark2, this needs to be an Iterator instead.. 

issue: we're not supporting 2.0 yet so if you use it with 2.0 - you might have troubles, yes 
solution: 

issue: I am new to nd4j/dl4j. I want to use 0.6.0 but seem to have maven dependency issues with the perf/jblas libs. can 0.6.0 be used with perf/jblas. Are there any other recommendations for specific dependencies. Specifically I need the newer BooleanIndexing class methods that are only in 0.6.0 
solution: 

issue: fatsmcgee: file an issue please and provide source code there file an issue please 
solution: 

issue: raver120: @jobernbergerthat's a version conflict with spark that's not a bug a lot of the boilerate stuff there was yarn error messages then the stack trace at the top You setup the classpath for spark wrong that's the reason you're getting that What version are you using? 
solution: 

issue: It's your internet I keep telling you that t's sole your internet I mean look at the error message Your internet is bad pure and simple If you see any corrupt jar files or anything like that it's not us it's your internet every time 
solution: all scenarios. 

issue: I keep getting this error with nd4j 0.6.0: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.nd4j.linalg.factory.Nd4jBackend.getConfigurationResource()Lorg/nd4j/linalg/io/Resource; on windows in eclipse... any ideas 
solution: 

issue: jxarms3: dl4j, nd4j, datavec versions must all be 0.6.0 - same as examples 
solution: 

issue: can we expect more comprehensive documentation for RL4J anytime soon? or is it not a priority atm? 
solution: 

issue: Mind posting a gist of your spark job? jgainesau: you don't want to use sc.paralellize we get burned by that a lot If you can try to use datavec on spark 
solution: don't auto specify master use spark submit. 

issue: why would you use saveAsTextFile on a RDD<DataSet>?? right, well it's not what you want (obviously) :) 
solution: To be fair that's specific to us :D. 

issue: Hi!I\'m trying to construct  hyperparameter optimization for RNNs, but get an  "IllegalStateException: Cannot get value: ParameterSpace index has not been set" Exception in the IntegerParameterSpace.getValue.Is there maybe something with the way I assign the ParameterSpace in my  MultiLayerSpace setup? [<-CODE->] sure thx AlexDBlack: Issue [<-ISSUE->] created :) ( [<-ISSUE->] ) 
solution: 

issue: ehh, I'm thick. I'll try to rephrase that,, if I initialize, why do I need inputsplit? if I already passed it to spark, with this bit: [<-LINK->] but, so it should be automatic then, when I create a datasetiterator from the csvreader?  doesn't seem to work, I get a nullpointer exception.  transforms work just nicely. 
solution: 

issue: Hello All,I need help with this error [<-LINK->] gist updated [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: So I'm noticing that although by GPU is quite busy now, my CPU's not doing much. It's roughly using 1 thread out of 8. Does it make sense to have both GPU and CPU work together on training? 
solution: 

issue: at the moment only a single backend is supported so you get either cpu training or gpu training you can't have both in the same JVM 
solution: hmm... 

issue: Hi all. I'm trying to upgrade from DL4j 0.4.0 to 0.6.0 and I'm observing that 0.6.0 seems to consume a lot more memory, even when just building a config for a tiny NN via NeuralNetConfiguration.Builder. Is that a known fact? 
solution: 

issue: I\'ve tried DBN as a preprocessor to MLP and it works very well. With CNN, I\'ve got thato.d.n.c.l.InputTypeUtil - Automatic addition of FF -> CNN preprocessors: not yet implemented (layer name: "null")Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Invalid input for Convolution layer (layer name="null"): Expected CNN input, got InputTypeFeedForward(50)So, how about LSTM with BPTT?I mean if I tried LSTM with BPTT, does DBN will work as a pretrain/preprocessor? 
solution: 

issue: also I have this in logs.. is it ok?DEBUG org.reflections.Reflections - could not scan file org/nd4j/nativeblas/linux-x86_64/libnd4j.so in url jar many similar logs

issue: Any clue why this happens?CUDA error at C:/projects/skymind_deploy/libnd4j/blas/cuda/NativeOps.cu:4979 code=77(<unknown>) "result" hahaha, sorry, teasing a little bit 
solution: 

issue: What's the nd4j equivalent of numpy.where? I have a feeling that it's something to do with NDArrayIndex and slice, but I can't figure it out. 
solution: 

issue: I was just wondering why the scala RNN example (GravesLSTMCharModellingExample) was taken down. It ran fine on my laptop. Any reason why it is deprecated? I have a usecase which needs LSTM using scala + spark and it perfectly fits my purpose AlexDBlack: Did you guys try running LSTM with spark + scala? Thanks much!  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] Is the error specific to mac again? But this time it doesnt run on on eclipse either unlike last time 
solution: 

issue: I suspect this is one of those stupid beginner errors, but I'm at a loss as to how I should be solving it. I have my network set up (based on the Crepe network), and I'm trying to feed data into it in batches of 1000. However, I'm getting an error saying that my input data is the wrong shape, and it seems to be that it's too big by a factor of the batch size. Is there some configuration I've missed that tells DL4J that I'm using batches? Or have I misunderstood how they work and I need to set my input size to be significantly bigger?https://gist.github.com/jbaker-dstl/b46c6307812b986e1cbc02451d36db95 Just checking now (sorry, it's running on my underpowered laptop so takes a while). It's actually erroring before Line 178 (when I call model.fit()), so I'll check the size after it reads in the training dataset. 
solution: 

issue: How does you dataset actually look like, i.e. what shape does it actually have if you print it in line 178? (Arrays.toString(next.getFeatuers().shape())) it should be (500,  CharacterQuantization.ALPHABET.length() * 1014) 
solution: 

issue: are you sure that it actually  is the normalization pre proprocessor that you are waiting on and not loading the data that is being pre-processed?

issue: @raver119 Guidelines says to ping someone if I don't get a response so I'm pinging you. Any clue on how to use Deeplearning4j for online learning?https://gitter.im/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j?at=580a6c25fb138dce65e8bf18 
solution: or you can do that one by one, as soon as you get new dataset. 

issue: Hello guys, Ive followed letter by letter the deeplearning4j QuickStart Guide. However, it seems IntelliJ is not importing corredctly any of the deeolearning4j libraries. Is tehre anyone who can help me get started? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: - hey just an FYI - looks like with the correct pom/settings, word2vec will run with glibc version 2.12 
solution: that's surprising.. well - it ran once anyway!. 

issue: Is DL4J a good candidate if I want to port an existing CNN from Keras? Also, is it possible to not have any learning of back propagation if I already have fine tuned/defined weights? 
solution: and yes, sure it's possible to use models for inference only, without updating weights. 

issue: Hi everyone. I'm new to machine learning in general, as well as dl4j. I am looking into building a supervised learning text classification system, and see that ParagraphVectors looks basically like what I need. But, my dataset has one difference: I have multiple labels per document rather than just one. I feel like this is a dumb question, but what should my next step be? 
solution: 

issue: Hi I'm getting a java.lang.NullPointerException error while using the org.deeplearning4j.nn.layers.feedforward.autoencoder.AutoEncoder.setParam(). Can we still use this Autoencoder class to restore data point given hidden layer vector? or are we currently using something else? Thank you so much guys 
solution: 

issue: try building it from the cloned repo. i'm getting an error about missing javafx.scene. Google says something about how that's no longer part of the standard jdk after 8u40.  Heading down the rabbit hole ... I've got a simple TablesawDataIterator I'd be happy to contribute. My observation is that tablesaw is lightning fast and pretty easy to work with. I was going fine using it for preprocessing ... and then hit this bump trying to build a neuralnetconfig. *TablesawDataSetIterator 
solution: 

issue: not at this moment tsne, and barneshutt tsne 
solution: 

issue: thanks, is there any way to reduce dimensionality of word vectors using dl4j? I have tried BarnesHutTsne to cluster doc vectors but the result did not show clear clusters 
solution: file an !issue please. also, you might want to check tsne. at least i was able to cluster vectors using tsne. 

issue: When I run the training of the same model (using identical code) on different computers I get different results for the accuracy of the model, any idea why that could be? I initialise the MultiLayerConfiguration and BalancedPathFilter with a constant seed for both runs on the different computers. 
solution: 

issue: What backend are you using though? You need to use the android backend 
solution: New to it! : )just playing with the serialization. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] Any specific reason why I get this error? So, it should run fine if I install spark 1.6 right? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: re tablesaw fork: excellent! I look forward to working with it. Happy to contribute. Meanwhile I am able to keep going with my Frankenstein, DIY version for the time being. 
solution: 

issue: Hey Adam, can you help me out a bit 
solution: I was running into OOM errors and now I built nd4j from master, which solves the issue, so that's good. 

issue: keskella: That's a clashing spark version problem samvan:  [<-LINK->] VasanthAbyeti: can you file an !Issue with what happened there? You shouldn't have to set any extra properties I'm not going to build that right now but you have to learn how gradle works with classifiers I think I already explained to you how it works earlier? See my explanation of how classifiers work here: [<-LINK->] I also already explained to you we have an android backend ready to go It's one of the jar files you can specify with a classifier hbb21st: I answered your question on stackoverflow Not sure if that wa syuo or not EIther way - we need more information yep shoot 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I have a slight problem here I tried running the Word2VecRawTextExample, and opened the result in [<-LINK->] And here's what I've got 
solution: 

issue: cuda 8.0?? 
solution: 

issue: Maybe we can remove the following line and it might work? [<-LINK->] 
solution: That means that he'll have to compile from source in order to get it to work. he's already trying to build from source.... 

issue: Hi@AlexDBlack... While creating inferred vectors form my own para vectors... I am getting Number format exception like : Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "News)" AlexDBlack: ... Similar error was with word "Top".. Is it something related to tokenization? 
solution: 

issue: gks141270: Could you give us an diea of what you're confused about so we can improve the docs? idea* We could write a 10000 page novel on what this does It would be good to understand what you're missing exactly So there's a few things here then 1 being: There's already a lot of literature on RNNs You should learn that separate from computation graph We aren't going to hand hold you through every little step We have an oreilly !book 
solution: An LSTM IS. 

issue: hi to all. what does mean this error: "activations into layer are h=2 but kernel size is 3 with padding 0"? 
solution: 

issue: BTW, guys, I know that the [<-LINK->] page proposes a way to cite you. But do you have any paper related to dl4j? Some journals are not very inclined to citations that are not actual papers or books. 
solution: 

issue: Adam, Currently I am experimenting with weather data. I am using normal neural network that gives me 75% accuracy to predict temperature of next 24 hours. So, I was trying my hand in RNN+LSTM. I have got huge weather data online to download. They provide data from 1900 to till-date for entire world 
solution: 

issue: Adam, I bought Deep Learning e-book and downloading it right now. 
solution: 

issue: I am using the dl4j-examples, it had integrated the slf4j and logback/log4j, and it has logback.xml and log4j.propertis, but I cannot find the progress log. It only log "o.d.m.s.SequenceVectors - Building learning algorithms:o.d.m.s.SequenceVectors -           building ElementsLearningAlgorithm: [CBOW]o.d.m.s.SequenceVectors - Starting learning process..."

issue: liulhdarks: I think he refers to his branch  r119_word2vec, but I might be wrong 
solution: 

issue: Hi, when using Nd4j with nd4j-cuda-7.5, is there a way to free up resources? it seems my gpu memory is being consumed and not recovered after each computation, and calling cleanup() in INDArray does not seem to help raver119: would the JVM GC clean GPU memory as well? After the compute function, GPU memory is still not released, even when the associated INDArray is gone 
solution: I run into problem in my second call of Nd4j.create(...), where GPU memory is full. Can I free the memory somehow? Before Nd4j, I used jcublas which would allow me to free  memory by calling JCuda.free(Pointer), is there something similar in Nd4j?. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] sparkmlnetwork chokes hard on my training data. this comes when its beginning to do fit I run inside sbt, and even sbt dies when this happens  [<-LINK->] here's the code. I suppose I could post the csv data, but its gone through datavec already so actual data is in binary hmm, maybe my data is still bust.  I started thinking that datavec and csvrecordreader are unable to cope with some files being 3 lines and others 5mb. nvm mine as well.  Its training now, but not giving output. 
solution: 

issue: wasn't there a nd4j-cuda-8-platform? Or am I just imagining things? Yup, looks like it exists.  What's up with my maven install... Hmm looks like maven is freaking out because dl4j-examples/pom.xml doesn't have a version tag for the nd4j-backend. Works for native-platform but not cuda-8-platform? 
solution: 

issue: 8.0-platform 
solution: Need strong typing of pom files.. 

issue: the loss function there? no, I don't think that maps to any of the loss functions we have yetso that'd be a custom loss function (which we support as of 0.6.0) 
solution: 

issue: the complication with android has been the nd4j native libraries (libnd4j)as of 0.6.0 we've released android binaries for nd4j: [<-LINK->] soin theoryyou should be good to go with that 
solution: 

issue: Adam, I have finished changing gender detection program and I want to push changes in the branch I created.

issue: I just downloaded the examples and tried to run on ppc, what should I report when filing the issue? not from IBM, just working on a Power8 machine. nope, we are a university lab with a power8 machine the nd4j-examples are running OK though 
solution: 

issue: So I can work well with the 3d matrix even if I got 1D Data? 
solution: 

issue: l1/l2 is tied to your weights and your loss function l1/l2 penalizes your gradients and it adds to your score basically "large steps are bad" is what it tells the neural net you shouldn't be playing with the internals if you don't have to 
solution: 

issue: develeon: it's known bug for 0.6.0, caused by oom workarounds are: reduce memory use, or compile from current master on current master it wont crash, but sure will work slower then using gpu memory 
solution: 

issue: Hopefully not a dumb question. Is there a mapping of VW<=>DL4J ? In particular, some of these things [<-LINK->] can,  I'm sure be done by DL4J, and some can't. I'm interested only in regression, currently running VW with L1 (--l1_arg) , L2 (--l2_arg)  & loss_function = quantile, also using loss_function = squared for other problems.  Wish to swap out VW for DL4J since the rest of my code is in Scala. answered my own question:  [<-LINK->]

solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: Can you show me where label vectors are created in code ? 
solution: 

issue: Can you give us some more example for MultiLayerNetwork predict (images). I need a standalone predict example.Thanks! I  used predict method.as:int[] p = model.predict(ds.getFeatures());List<String> predict = model.predict(ds);The dataSet must have labelNames.Actually when i just want predict ds, the ds has no labelNames, so error.So can you give me some tips or examples. Thanks 
solution: 

issue: I m working on CNN for Cifar-10  dataset and while training i get the warning  like-WARN  [2016-10-26 07:16:56,356] org.deeplearning4j.optimize.solvers.BackTrackLineSearch: Value is infinite after jump. oldStep=1.0. score=NaN, score2=NaN. Scaling back step size...what it means ? Thanks for your information 
solution: 

issue: app86: the only way at this moment is dependency in your project, so any 1 backend at any given time 
solution: maybe set  the labelNames to mode is a good try. So we can get form mode.  hah, in any case, thank you very much..

Codes as below, anything wrong?ImagePreProcessingScaler myScaler = new ImagePreProcessingScaler();myScaler.fit(datasetAll);myScaler.save(new File("statistics")); eraly: I filed to DN4J, since the class belong to ND4J. Do you want me to file to DL4J? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: huh, I think I figured out the bug. its just that I used multiple sequences, I thought it'd be too stupid to notice that I had several sequences that I tried to train a a single sequence. I'm testing now, after cleaning my data. AlexDBlack: ok, I got the same error while using just one sequence, so it wasn't data. hopefully you can figure it out. issue is still posted in the meanwhile I suppose I''ll try getting the spark version up and running.  I still can't figure out how to call rnntimestep when I just do model.fit(directoryofdatavecoutput) and use training master for the data 
solution: spark training is done using model averaging - doesn't make sense (nor is it possible) to distribute that forward pass/rnnTimeStep over a cluster [<-LINK->]. 

issue: I trying to create Paragraph vector with a pretrained Word2Vec. I am doing a ParagaphVector.build().useExistingWordVector(model).

solution: 

issue: keskella: "with sparkmlnetwork and trainingmaster, how do you get an iterator to call rnntimestep with from the trainingmaster?"you don\'t - if you want to use rnnTimeStep, you need to do it directly on the trained MultiLayerNetwork (SparkDl4jMultiLayer.getNetwork())doesn\'t make sense to do that in a distributed manner sayakbiswas: no cube activation function currently, but we'll get that added: [<-ISSUE->] won't be hard to add 
solution: 

issue: yeah, you're on your own as far as netbeans + not using a build toolwe strongly recommend using maven (or sbt, gradle etc if you want) for this stuffcan be a pain to learn but totally worth it (avoids issues like this, for one thing...) 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: missing anything? model save and load for spark -example would be real nice.  actually let me check this with you, I first train, then its possible to save the model so that I can run tests and predictions on it?  Just checking this is the process. 
solution: agibsonccc: this is partially due to scala, but I'd prefer the code to work in separate objects, with just data being passed.  If I'd call SparkDl4jMultilayer again from a separate object/main, or if I just  dump the code in to one main, then I'd have to retrain every time I start it.. 

issue: for training rnn, should I always use CSVSequenceRecordReader? I'm asking because datavec is choking if I use it. 
solution: 

issue: keskella: added a comment on your issue: [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: Question,  how can I judge TerminationReason is  Error  or  IterationTerminationCondition  or EpochTerminationCondition?    When " Hit epoch termination condition at epoch 29.

issue: just to check if my understanding is correct for the RNNs and data import. If I have a time series of [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], and I want to perform regression. My input file could be[1,2][2,3][3,4] etc?So basically current value and what value I'm trying to predict? 
solution: 

issue: this library is thebomb.com thanks 2 all devs who worked on this project ! 
solution: 

issue: dan-lind: re: data - yes, if you want to predict the next time step (univariate time series), your input data would have current time step and next time step at each row (feature and label respectively)re: exception - we'll need the full stack trace in a !gist robGetsTheJobDone: thanks, glad you like it. Still plenty of work to do as always though :) 
solution: 

issue: Excuse me,  how to close the message "o.d.e.t.BaseEarlyStoppingTrainer - Starting early stopping training"? Due to log4J? 
solution: 

issue: any sample code on cnns and autoencoders? I haven't explore all the sample code.. are they in the sample? 
solution: Well to be fair - we aren't going to rewrite half the intenret for every deep learning use case. 

issue: AlexDBlack: is there an example of how to use RegressionEvaluation? Can't find any in the examples right now I just triedRegressionEvaluation evaluation = new RegressionEvaluation(1);evaluation.evalTimeSeries(net.getLabels(), net.output(testData));log.info(evaluation.stats()); it runs fine now, but not sure if I'm using it right :-) 
solution: 

issue: sangav: @agibsonccci’ve added support for pretrained vectors some time ago, but not sure if that was 0.6.1 or 0.6.0. 95% that it was 0.6.0 though but it’s mostly for inference 
solution: 

issue: I just tried running a net with a HistogramIterationListener, but getting "Template "/org/deeplearning4j/ui/weights/weights.ftl" not found." when opening the UI in the browser built from source if that might be an issue besides that message in the browser, I can't see any other error in the log

issue: Hi, I\'m new to DL4J (but not to deep learning). I\'m trying to train my own CNN (using computation graphs) but all calls to fit(features, labels) fail after a while with "Process finished with exit code -1073741819 (0xC0000005)". I\'m guessing this comes from native code (I\'m on Windows 10, not using CUDA), however there  is no log or any other message printed - where can I get more info to help me debug this? 
solution: 

issue: just to check: you're using version 0.6.0? 
solution: 

issue: vtablan: could you please file an !issue at least with your nn conf, so i could try to reproduce it just in case it’s something else 
solution: 

issue: will do - thanks!By "nn conf" you mean the code that builds the comp graph? 
solution: it's Scala, but I think you guys are OK with that.(...and I hope that's not the root cause of the issue). scala for our purposes is just java with type inference. 

issue: I haven't been doing much in DL space for some time, lately looked into tensorflow a bit because where are lots of pretrained models where.Recently converted yahoo NTSF model from caffe to tensorflow and served with TF Serving, worked quite well as a POC, thinking about productionalizing itAlso trying to do automated image moderation (bad quality, object not allowed in our marketplace, porn, etc). Image search worked to some degree with pretrained inception finetuned on our dataset, but not perfect :) I'll check that out :) 
solution: For DL4J issues, click 'New Issue' at [<-LINK->] - for ND4J, use [<-LINK->] instead. 

issue: New issue created: [<-ISSUE->] The crash message on Linux points the finger as nd4j, so I created it there.Thanks!

solution: 

issue: Could data errors for an RNNs cause the score to become huge? I'm getting score at iteration 0 is 334825088, and can't figure out what's wrong. I've tried changing learning rate, normalization, weightInit, updater. No luck, still this huge error from the beginning 
solution: 

issue: is there an easy function for getting the shape of anINDArray? 
solution: yes. INDArray.shape(). 

issue: Interested. On python I was using keras. But how does it work with the theano / tf backend? 
solution: so you can run iton say: spark. or you can use it as a starting point. 

issue: AlexDBlack: Thanks, I will check that out tomorrow! Yes peephole was my guess, I found somewhere... Anyway I like stackoverflow for community share information 
solution: 

issue: sure, feel free to copy/adapt my comments there if you want :) 
solution: haridaniel: feel free to post the answer. I show up from time to time and try to answer questions when I see them. 

issue: Hi, I have an sbt (0.13.8) project with the following: libraryDependencies ++= Seq("org.nd4j" % "nd4j-native" % "0.6.0" classifier "windows-x86_64")But I get an error complaining about artifacts not being found: http://pastebin.com/HCuxGSYT  with the full build.sbt on the top.  As you can tell, I\'m on windows at present.  Any thoughts as to why it\'s not picking up https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/nd4j/nd4j-native/0.6.0/nd4j-native-0.6.0-windows-x86_64.jar 
solution: 

issue: Hi seem like GloveExample.java has an error everytime i run the code, it's errors are all NaN 
solution: i just start use ，cant help you. Ops, i don't expect that answer :D. 

issue: kbrowder: so it looks like sbt is starting to have the same issues as Gradle where it supports Maven profiles, but differently than. I wonder they even bother. Anyway, just explicitly exclude that artifact from the build and it will work 
solution: 

issue: depends on the range of your data. maybe relu (except for "dying relu" problem) if it\'s >= 0, or tanh if it\'s strictly in range -1 to 1 (or sigmoid for 0 to 1)but identity is usually fine 
solution: 

issue: Just a second let me explain again:    I use a (libsvm) training set of only two lines, to be able to track things. Apparently, my class reads it correctly and there is no instance (of the two) without at least one label (you can see it on the gist ling, the last 6 elements are the labels, 0 or 1). Then this passes to the NN and while fitting I get tyhe exception sorry for the typos are you sure this is not a dl4j problem? I mean is it supposed to run smoothly for multi-label classificatio, has it been tested? If not I could help with the development because this is something that really interests me. I ll do the unit test and get back to you

issue: Hello, I\'m new to this forum. I have read the instructions before posting this question. However I an experiencing an issue with "DEBUG org.reflections.Reflections - could not scan file org" It seems there are a few varients on this error [<-ISSUE->] and [<-ISSUE->] . I\'m a little stuck as to how to fix this issue because the error message is not very descriptive so I don\'t know what the actual problem is. If someone could get back to me. I would be happy to discuss my issue in more detail 
solution: 

issue: But intuitively, the forgetting mechanism happens via the forget "gate" -- sigmoid hidden units (whose values are [0, 1]) that are multiplied times the memory cells. The closer to zero, the more  the past is forgotten. Those gates are a function of the input and previous state. One hypothesis is the model notices that the system dynamics have started changing rapidly (so that the past is less informative), so that the hidden state is largely determined by current input and not by the distant past

issue: rcorbish: FYI, I plan to make nd4j use [<-LINK->] and others like MAGMA, it will make a lot of things easier 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] This program works without masking of feature? Is masking always necessary?  [<-LINK->] Is it something do with mac os? When LSTM is run on batch mode without spark, my program runs fine. I want to port it to spark and i get above error with spark local Any best way to debug such issues? 
solution: 

issue: masking with RNNs is only necessary (a) if you have different time series lengths in the same minibatch, and/or (b) you don't have inputs/outputs at all time steps (so some time steps are just 'padding' - not real data) 
solution: 

issue: I've never had native code issues running spark o_0 Those should just never happen Are you running the latest version? 0.6.0? 
solution: 

issue: and include file /Users/arakumar/Documents/work/attribution/attribution-model/hs_err_pid99057.log 
solution: However, when i run it on console and not through eclipse, I get a memory issue ... 

issue: agibsonccc: I've checked, It wouldn't work in my case. I just wanted a NN module to replace the Q function I already have in my project. 
solution: 

issue: any way you can give me some code I can copy + paste, and click run? preferably in a github !issuethat'll be the easiest way to debug this 
solution: 

issue: is "Score at iteration 0 is 284041" ever reasonable for an RNN regression problem, or am I still doing something wrong? 
solution: 

issue: depends on your data dimensionality and loss function if I remember correctly you were using MSE? 
solution: so if your output is a vector with 284041 entries, you are off by an average of 1 per entry :D. then you are probably still doing something wrong. 

issue: tombear1: dataSetObjectSize = the number of examples in each DataSet objectbatchSizePerWorker = standard minibatch size (i.e., equivalent the the DataSetIterator minibatch size config) claytantor: nice, looks great. downloading now to check it out :) 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: thanks! you may have to restart the kernel and run all after Jupyter starts the notebook to get it torun correctly. I am trying to figure out why the notebook state is a wrong on startup now. I am also working with@alexarchambaultto improve dependency management. I am writing the epic blog post to go with it now, that always takes time too. so in a nutshell, not perfect yet. also I am accepting PRs.

solution: 

issue: The RBM described here ( [<-LINK->] ) is not the same as the one proposed by Hinton. The canonical RBM's hidden layer h can only take 0 or 1 values. Is the RBM implemented by dl4j a variant version of RBM? 
solution: xuzhongxing: if you read up a bit there are a lot of different flavors of rbms. You mean that I could configure the RBM class to be the normal one?. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] I tried using mavenCentral() repository as well, but it also gave same error except for repository location.android #gradle Thanks@agibsonccc,when I am trying to use mavencentral, it is giving same error [<-CODE->] I referred to this doc: [<-LINK->] "provided" is used there shd I use compile and provide some classifier name? 
solution: 

issue: Hmm. Thanks. I'm working on a toy example to get things going. (A simple tic-tac-toe learner) It's obvious I'm doing something wrong, and I cannot possibly expect you guys to take a look at what I've done so far. Can I turn to skymind for this (eg, pay for it), or are they only interested in big scale projects? 
solution: 

issue: Should NN training run on Spark with 1 worker give similar results as local training? Because I'm trying the same conf as I used locally but the net doesn't learn at all (score sits at around 30k) 
solution: 

issue: just want to double check that my understanding is correct: for RNN and regression, I would split my labels/features just like in the UCISequenceClassificationExample ?

solution: 

issue: np. I'm not affiliated with dl4j in anyway. However I ask a lot of questions myself, so I try to help out whenever I can :-) 
solution: dan-lind: . Where are you affiliated?. I work for a consulting company in Sweden. 

issue: raviprakashmishra: and confirming you are using version 0.6.0?try the thing mentioned at the bottom of this page: [<-LINK->] (and for future large outputs/stack traces - can you use !gist instead of pasting directly here? thanks) if you've just cloned from there, you'll be on 0.6.0. So yeah, try the java.library.path thing from that link 
solution: AlexDBlack: , I am working windows-64 bit machine. If it  has got to do anything with this fact. 

issue: jkpate: we need to take some time to update those - next release we have a gui that can measure performance which will help a lot we still have yet to do a full pass on benchmarks yet We would love impartial feedback 1 nuance is: ETL The soumith benchmarks have timing for raw methods eg: cnn feed froward they don't cover etl so training time has a lot of variance We SHOULD have near parity, it's all c/c++ 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys, so I am trying to set up dl4j examples into eclipse and I'm almost there but when I run mvn eclipse:eclipse in git bash it complains about a missing pom file wait raver, should I just make a new issuse at the dl4j to specify improving the tutorial in the step before doing mvn eclipse:eclipse? 
solution: 

issue: I\'ve just tried to add dl4j core and nd4j backends to a project that uses gradle. I did go through the description mentioned here : [<-LINK->] and addedcompile \'org.nd4j:nd4j-native:0.6.0\'\n    compile \'org.nd4j:nd4j-native:0.6.0:macosx-x86_64\'\n    compile "org.deeplearning4j:deeplearning4j-core:0.6.0". But I get an error sayingCould not find javacpp-presets-${os.name}-${os.arch}.jar (org.bytedeco:javacpp-presets:1.2).. Obviously this is related to gradle not being able to resolve the os.name and os.arch. Any ideas how I could work my way around this ?

solution: As far as I know it's distributed and you can run it anywhere in principle. 

issue: Are you using current master or 0.6.0?  [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: EdeMeijer: No, json mapping is happening in deeplearning4j-nn module afaik. So need to build that 
solution: avkumar: I think you should think about the amount of features you want your model to be able to learn. In a time series, that could be a few or a lot, depends on what you're trying to learn from it. 

issue: Darn, I rebuilt dl4j from master but still getting this Jackson exception In fact, it's actually coming from the shaded version of Jackson according to the stack trace 
solution: Time for an issue, I guess. no. 

issue: Sorry, how should I go about ignoring this shade module? I removed it from the Dependencies tab at the module in project structure But that's probably not the way to go 
solution: then run mvn install. in the dl4j repo. 

issue: I'm currently building a large Word2Vec model using the cuda backend, but it seems like it isn't actually using the GPU.

I read [<-LINK->] and looked at the spark examples, but I can't say I got a good picture of what is exactly needed to get all this running on for example a couple of EC2 nodes. Any suggested reading would be appreciated. 
solution: Would you say trying to run a Spark cluster and running some toy jobs without using DL4j would be a good start?.

solution: 

issue: Hi, I have a simple (stupid question), I would like to learn word2vec on terms not on sentences or text ? it's possible ? raver119: My question is if I can learn word2vec using bag of word not sentences or text ? I mean, the corpus for the train is text (like wikipedia ), and I am asking if I can learn using corpus based on word (not sentences juste words like user tags ) raver119: Then, it 's not sequence, it's juste bag of word 
solution: still no luck. you have words (like user tags). you have training corpus (like wikipedia), ok. you want to train those "tags" with context as your training corpus?. 

issue: NawalOuldamer: i can't get your question. mind clarifying? still not getting the difference. It's still unordered sequence of <anything> learned. Are you asking how to feed non-text corpus into training? 
solution: 

issue: I can call methods like this:             model.conf().setLearningRateByParam("W", 0.001);model.conf().setLearningRateByParam("RW", 0.001);model.conf().setLearningRateByParam("b", 0.001);But it has no effect If I call init again, that clears the weigths also I think 
solution: turambar: : No  even init() method also has  no effect. 

issue: I have similar issues with word2vec. It's been running for 3 days now. I'll try to add some info to the issue 
solution: 

issue: turambar: : This is not working, model.conf() returns NeuralNetConfiguration, whilst new new MultiLayerNetwork(config) receives only MultiLayerConfiguration what is totally different class It can be solved by rebuilding MultiLayerConfiguration  inside the loop.  [<-LINK->] Is this normal graph of heap while training? Or I do something wrong? GC works a lot. 
solution: 

issue: JCalderan: file an !issue please 
solution: 

issue: haridaniel: init method will only do something once (it's a one-off thing)re: changing the learning rate by changing the config: I'm not 100% sure that it'll work reliably (I'd need to check)there are usually copies of the current learning rate in the updater classes (adagrad, rmsprop, momentum etc) separate to the config at test time: it depends on your use case... if you can batch examples (and hence don't have strict latency requirements) GPUs are fine - you can still get good utilization. they suck for single example type scenariosotherwise CPUs are probably the better choice rburton: right. I mean you can test it out and seeGPUs will work fine in either, just utilization/efficiency might not be great in some circumstances 
solution: 

issue: Question about the usage of GPUs. When you're training your model, it makes sense to run that on GPUs given the hardware requirements, but once the model is created, does it make sense to run it the application that utilizes that model on a GPU vs. CPU? 
solution: So in short, of the application has a workload that's suited for a GPU during running of the application, it will pay off, otherwise if the processing is very much inline with your traditional application CPU will be more suited. 

issue: yussiffa: could you file the issue like what I asked you to yesterday? Are you using datavec?

issue: Hello, In FAQ of this page [<-LINK->] , it is mentioned "If you are using Ubuntu, the serialized data may not be getting loaded properly. This is a problem with Ubuntu. We recommend testing this version of Wordvec on another version of Linux." Is there any workaround? I am trying to load a pre-trained word embeddings from and I get the following error "java.lang.RuntimeException: com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParseException: Illegal character ((CTRL-CHAR, code 31)): only regular white space (\\r, \\n, \\t) is allowed between tokens" is this because I am using windows? or there's a problem with the pre-trained vectors file itself. 
solution: 

issue: would it be easier to change my cuda version to 7.5? 
solution: yes, that’s an option too. esp since your gpu is compatible with 7.5. 

issue: Hello, I try to do a maven install on RL4J. But it failed because the code in Git using some dependency on 0.6.1 snapshot. For example, nd4j-native-0.6.1 snapshot. Where can I find the jars for 0.6.1 snapshot? thank you 
solution: well, i can’t say anything here,  not using eclipse. but that’s really surprising behavior. 

issue: Hi all - question on word2vec processing on spark.  Any idea on the memory requirements for handling 1.9G of text - specifically for driver-memory and executor-memory? 
solution: I can check - but I would guess the vocab length is about 300,000k. I keep running out of memory.. 

issue: i apologize@agibsonccc.. i just bought a new laptop with gforce and trying to run the examples 
solution: fancy *. 

issue: you've ignored all i wrote you before, right? i see it's not a data point. you're comparing warm & wet there\'s no pure "neg sampling only" mode on spark at this moment there's even no cbow -hs 0 means no hs but there's still hs implied in spark code cbow, separate algos, variable window size, native batches <--- all that stuff is waiting for testers on standalone at this moment 
solution: spark w2v is NOT updated to native batches yet, because it's waiting for parameters server. 

issue: raver119: still open an issue?  not sure it makes sense since any tests I run are not really relevant. 
solution: so don't forget to include info about your cluster. 

issue: Hmm.. I have my doubts about how well that'll work yeah They just don't have the memory or CPU to train neural nets I think 
solution: If you're doing stuff with sensor data on rPI's, just stream them to a server/cluster, do the training there, and sync back the trained model. 

issue: no, I mean what do you actually expect to learn from that? Without data you can't build and tune an architecture that is going to work... also deep learning usually needs loads of data 
solution: 

issue: can you add something so we can reproduce your problem easily? add it to the issue, as I'm heading out for the day 
solution: :). 

issue: another n00b problem: where do you learn about iterators?I'm trying to follow the conv net example, but using my own datahow do I turn my DataSet into interator? 
solution: I used Nd4j.readTxt to get data in as 4 INDArrays. 

issue: EdeMeijer: @raver119has worked on a lot of the internals though :D I built the initial version of libnd4j too, but raver make it work :P Have full stack trace (please ALWAYS and I mean ALWAYS post a !gist) of these things daredemo: sampling assumes columns for some reason (probably legacy behavior) mind filing an issue !issue on nd4j? It's because of the sampling Probably from this  [<-LINK->] weird: [<-LINK->] dataset doesn't use columns anymore You're using the latest version right? 
solution: 

issue: but is there any workaround in the meanwhile? can I use some other iterator? (I guess the problem is with the iterator?) and there is no other iterator I could try in the meanwhile? 
solution: I mean, in the LenetMnistExample, they use the DataSetIterator mnistTrain = new MnistDataSetIterator(batchSize,true,12345);. 

issue: @oukohou switch your constructor to not use any argumentssee what that outputson the scaler @agibsonccc  hello,last  night  I got  a  visitor ,sorry  I replied  late. And I just  tried  with code changed  to :ImagePreProcessingScaler imageNormalizer = new ImagePreProcessingScaler();  //(0,1,maxBitsofImage);and still  no luck , received this: -1    NaN0    NaN1    NaN2    NaN3    NaN4    NaN5    NaN6    NaNany ideas will  be appreciated~~ agibsonccc: well , maybe I didn't  explain this well , I mean I uesd this method  as a  way to scale my image , then after  some iterations of earlyStopping ,  I  received  the  earlyStopping  score as followings: Score vs. Epoch:-1    NaN0    NaN1    NaN2    NaN3    NaN4    NaN5    NaN 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: if  you like , I  can send the iamges I used  to you for  former test  caseBTW , do you  got  examples  that  run  smoothly  from the  begining  of   reading   images to  the  end of  getting  a  fine  tuned  model ?

solution: 

issue: Is there a better way to fill the xy array in this Gist? [<-LINK->] Some Nd4J magic I am missing? '''Grid:[[0.00, 0.00], [1.00, 0.00], [0.00, 1.00], [1.00, 1.00]]Raw NN output:[[0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25], [0.30, 0.18, 0.19, 0.33], [0.28, 0.37, 0.19, 0.17], [0.34, 0.27, 0.15, 0.23]]Selected actions:[0.00, 3.00, 1.00, 0.00]''' for a 2x2 grid And 5x5 here: [<-LINK->] Code works.  But not very pretty. 
solution: 

issue: what does that array actually look like in practice? having a hard time visualizing it... I can't think of a better way to do that, tbh 
solution: I mean without the repeating structure, Nd4j.linspace would be the one to use, for the equal spacing part.... 

issue: Hi Everyone, Sorry for asking silly doubt. I want to use PCA to reduce dimensionality                                           INDArray nd2 = new NDArray(input);INDArray afterDimRed= PCA.pca(nd2, 2, true);  where input is a double data type matrix of 15 rows and 16 cols. When I  run it, I am getting an error java.lang.IllegalStateException: Column of left 16 != rows of right 15. Can anyone help me on this I am new to this. Sorry for doing that. can you let me know where I am going wrong 
solution: 

issue: Hi back again. I reset all the things but still got the same problem. I seems it's not fixed as [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: Hey@agibsonccc, I saw you merged my PR from yesterday, but if you want the accompanying tests to pass too you should merge [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: EdeMeijer: merged. If you have a small GPU it will also be slower :). also true :D. if you have a small neural net. 

issue: and that parameter server stuff is about sending INDArrays around... not specifically for neural networks though 
solution: 

issue: Hey, what doesException in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid size index 3 wher it\'s >= rank 3\n    at org.nd4j.linalg.api.ndarray.BaseNDArray.size(BaseNDArray.java:4099)tell me? I have some troubles understanding it. its a cnn i try to feed with wordvectors 
solution: I bet there are plenty of errors in it, as I just started experimenting. To give you more context: w2vec_hotel_big is generated by a modified word2vec uptraining example with an vectorsize od 300 and a layersize of  300, so i was thinking that the input is 300x300x1 [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Hi, is there any examples of dl4j about word prediction using word2vec and LSTM RNN? e.g., predict word after a word sequence context “I wanna fly in the” -> “sky" 
solution: 

issue: yes, so that means this dataset is not able to work with a cnn? 
solution: 400 height. so batch of 64 will be 4D array: 64 x 1 x 400 x 300. 

issue: I got a bit confused reading the examples... about the RecordReaderDataSetIterator and readCSVDataset... the output is not one-hot? the labels seem to be all just integers in the examples 
solution: created a jar of the whole project, ported it to a GPU and excuted it. 

issue: Guys, getting this: [<-LINK->] I'm running reconstruction RNN similar to this: [<-LINK->] My vectors are quite large 
solution: 

issue: avkumar: I'm running on mac 16G Ok, I will file an issue 
solution: I wanted to try docker too! but couldnt get to use it! may be we could try together! :). 

issue: whats a reasonable/7good score to expect from a RNN? this is quite all over the place right now, about from 0.3 to 0.7 f1 is reasonably stable at around 0.5 - 0.6 I only ran two epochs on this, for expediency, so I'll run it some more. 
solution: 

issue: Good morning. My 'intelligent' robots keep smashing into walls. Here is a simple gist to reproduce my problem. It looks like using IMax here does not deal with negative numbers well. Any hints appreciated. [<-LINK->]

solution: 

issue: Yes,I need dig the source code.Thanks your help ,Adam Gibson 
solution: there's a few of us who can help. 

issue: apparently you have to have your labels numbered from 0 to number of labels - 1, I had mine starting from 1, thus the error 
solution: 

issue: rcorbish: Another thing - (sorry to be asking so much)Is there a way in javacpp to 'know' when a buffer transfer is completed. Very occasionally I read the results of IntPointer (for example) and one of the values is missing - I put a breakpoint in to see when it's missing. When looking at the data sometime later I can see it is in fact there. [<-LINK->] 
solution: if you need a particular major order you can do do array.dup('c') or array.dup('f') and it will rearrange the ordering of the array for you. 

issue: should i use a linux os or a windows os for learing and working on dl4j.i started learing today so i dont have any knowledge. 
solution: working and trying out the examples given in the getting started guide. so "using". A lot of java devs use windows. 

issue: I see NaN values in ScoreIterator output with using AsyncDataSetIterator on GPU, the model is an example model... Could be a precision problem? 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I have a question about NeuralNetConfiguration class. It looks like it has dependency on jackson-databind previous version (2.5.1). Do you have any plans to update it to be compatible with latest version (2.8.1) of the lib? Sure. Will do. 
solution: We'll close that when the next release is out here :D will be good to have that documented. 

issue: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "0.01551484", huh, what could cause this? the data looks clean, and the number is common among it.  [<-LINK->] you're right, maybe someone is still awake.  for once I tried reading this thing, but I can't see anything wrong with it.  org.datavecapi.writable.text.toint hiccups and can't read the int from text?

solution: 

issue: Thanks! However... I put ".trainWordVectors(true)", what shall I put else?Regarding the labels, I understood with unsupervised learning I just avoid labelling. Is that not right? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: hi, how can i use 0.6.1-SNAPSHOT in maven?   i set the version by 0.6.1-SNAPSHOT, but not work~ 
solution: I might use BOW for example however. 

issue: Is anyone aware of a Spike & Slab RBM (ssRBM) implementation in DL4J? I wanted to run some experiments with deep belief nets that didn't require me to translate everything into binary vectors first the rolling ID should not be included if it provides no real "information" to your machine learner... 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: so its no to both? I mean time in milliseconds isn't any more helpful then a rolling id.  I'll clean them out then. ok, the data is ordered, so it should be fine if it gets that each new one builds on the last one. second question, I can't findanydocumentation on what to do with the complex after you've trained the model.  I mean prediction with model.output gets me indarray, but I can't see any docs.  Well, I haven't looked at nd4j-examples yet, maybe there's something useful there. ok, ty *complex math 
solution: so grab a book on math and figure out how to fish out something useful?. 

issue: Guys, getting this trying to build libnd4j => [<-LINK->] I did which gcc/usr/bin/gcc which gcc-5/usr/local/bin/gcc-5 Anything I can run to check the setup? I had to separate install cmake It was not part of your setup If not, I'm getting ./buildnativeoperations.sh: line 282: cmake: command not found 
solution: looks like cmake issue. 

issue: raver119: is there a way for me to just install the lib without building it? 
solution: raver119: could you share your cmake command from ./buildnativeoperations.sh? It seems it does not make anything for me. fountainheadpro: he'll be offline for a few hours now... different timezones and all. rcorbish: @raver119Thanks for the help. It was gcc version conflict. I added some info to the doc: [<-ISSUE->]. 

issue: Do you, guys publish snapshots anywhere? I see. I'm trying to rebuild everything on Mac, but it would not build other platforms. So sbt fails on downloading backends. Oh, let me try 
solution: 

issue: raver119: I wonder if I can use nd4j  0.6.1-snapshot with 0.6.0 dl4j/spark? 
solution: It should work, but it fails to locate the backend.. 

issue:  [<-ISSUE->] ... [<-ISSUE->] ...@raver119... any help with these ? ok I have a query... Once our model is built... is it possible to update it with more data ? 
solution: 

issue: When using normalizer.revert(), it looks to me like the labels are not reverted, event though I'm using fitLabel(true). Not sure if this is an issue, but seems a bit weird to me? :-) I'll open an issue to start with :-) Should I put it on datavec or dl4j? correct AlexDBlack:  [<-ISSUE->]

issue: Question: playing with the LenetMnistExample code, I tried drawing the weights of the filters of layer 0, the ConvolutionLayer. While the example converges to a good accuracy, the filter weights barely change from their initial random settings. (I assume the correct weights to be plotting are in model.getLayer(0).params(), and laid out as 20 biases (ignored) followed by 20 5x5 weight arrays.) Is that what you'd expect?

issue: Hello, I have tried running the VideoClassificationExample again, now with my own videos encoded with jcodec 1.0.5, whereas before i used 1.0.9.  The videos are of very bad quality (so, I'd advice dl4j to upgrade to jcodec 1.0.9). However, still no success with the 1.0.5 videos, although the error is different. Does it  make sense to file an issue? Most likely this is a very specific problem and I am not sure that this is something that you'd like to look into.

issue: HI~I have sone questions for help. I  try to make a chat robot by encoder and decoder.  But it always output the sequence by the same words. [<-LINK->] My input features is word2vec vector, through the accumulation of the way into the sentence vector. and the net's structure  is the same as  AdditionRNN example. raver119: Is my structure wrong? 
solution: at first glance the overall structure looks ok. 

issue: can I make a call to the paragraphVector model with the document name and get it's raw vector back? 
solution: not a name, a label though. raver119: is there any way to map the vector for each document with it's name ?. 

issue: I wanted to do a quick PoC on scala spark ...is there a prebuilt jar file for scalanet  that i could use without having to build via maven ?

solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: I solved it with a call to clearLayerMasksArrays after training, before using the network to output predictions. Maybe it's a good idea to clear masks after fitting internally? Prechtig: try adding a ScoreIterationListener too and see what that one reports maybe you're getting NaNs or something

solution: anyway, with next release there’s already base64 encoding enforced, so we never hit into that again. 

issue: Hello,I tried the mnist spark example ,submit the jar file on spark yarn but I get an Error 
solution: 

issue: edddh: looks like your network training is completely unstable, based on those scores... suggests either a problem with your data (lack of normalization, labels are not one-hot, etc) or possibly other issues (like learning rate). Go with .iterations(1) too, but that alone won't cause the problem you are seeing lacic: at a guess: maybe no data is being fed to the score function? I'd suggest stepping through it with a breakpoint to check that first 
solution: BruceKuiLiu: that\'s a classpath issue - you have multiple incompatible jackson versionstry "mvn dependency:tree" and look for jackson dependencies (com.fasterxml) with different versionsalso to get rid of that logging spam: add a logback.xml to your project (assuming you are using logback).

[<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] AlexDBlack: files uploaded, named "dataset" and "dataset2". Thanks a lot AlexDBlack: I think I have found my mistake AlexDBlack: No, my further attempts did not resolve. I am still waiting for your clues. Thanks 
solution: 

issue: Do nodes like OutputLayer and RnnOutputLayer have to be outputs?  Can they be inthe middle of a computation graph? 
solution: I see.  So it's not possible to for example feed a RnnOutputLayer data to a classifier in the same network?. 

issue: raver119: So to have a solution for Word2vec on GPU for now before the next version comes,  do you have a recommendation like using devicecachaeblelength or other properties I can set to avoid this model pushed to GPU ? 
solution: to step over that i've added batched operations, so nothing is executed untill we have full batch (i.e. 4096 skipgram or cbow rounds). 

issue: could be mistaken but I do not think it is included ? Just include one in your tokeniser  [<-LINK->] 
solution: just specify one of those - and you're all set.

issue: wmeddie: "not possible to for example feed a RnnOutputLayer data to a classifier in the same network"no, not possible: how would backpropagation work? I mean we could make it just not backpropagate the errors, in principle...if you just want softmax, use DenseLayer (or the new LossLayer)? 
solution: 

issue: Hi All, wanted to ask your advice? I followed a lot of the deeplearning4j examples including the UCISequenceClassificationExample . However they all seem to be aimed at classification. I wondered if there are any examples that show how to predict the sine wave or some numerical time-series forecasting 
solution: 

issue: fountainheadpro: that's another reason for the UI rewrite that will be part of the next release... it's can be very difficult to get dropwizard and spark to work in the same JVM edb2016: not specifically time series regression,  but there are other regression examples

issue: AlexDBlack: excuse me,  after  I've  got a  well trained  model , say , a model for image  classification ,   how  can  I  use  the  model  to  simply  input  an image  and  see the  prediction?Is  there  a  demo? I've  seen  examples  w.r.t  read  multiple  images  to  evaluate  the   model using  output(), but  seems  not  quite  appropriate  for  a single  image? AlexDBlack: actually  the  other  day  I  tried  with  one , but seems  I  didn\'t  do it  the  right  way , and  not quite  understand  the  standard  flow..... to  detail  the   error ,  my   code  is  as  below:INDArray predictImage1 = NDArrayUtil.toNDArray(fromFile(imagePath));INDArray predictResultmy = network.output(predictImage1);error  raised  :Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid input: expect output columns must be equal to rows 140 x columns 140 x channels 3 but was instead [1, 140]any  idea?

issue: Hello! May I ask about nd4j & libnd4j compilation issues here? In case I may. I built libnd4j with buildnativeoperations.sh script but when I try to build nd4j-native I get: !!! You have to compile libnd4j with cpu support first! What I should do? Thank you and I'm sorry if I should ask it in another place Thank you! I'm sorry for disturbance 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: a final question about yr proposed solution "use DataSet.save -> copy to HDFS -> call SparkDl4jMultiLayer.fit(String path) on the directory". Will this work regardless of what cluster manager I use? (I\'m using Spark’s own built-in Standalone cluster manager and not Hadoop YARN or Apache MESOS) 
solution: 

issue: is there an implement like openface?    i want to recognize face from a video ,dont know how to do that with dl4j~   :( , i have Checked out [<-LINK->] , but still don't know some details, is there a more specific demo?  anyone body knows? ok, can't wait the next release,

issue: hello, I'm trying a CSV classifier. My network config is : [<-LINK->] But the error curve shows a strange behaviour : [<-LINK->] .@AlexDBlack@agibsoncccAny thoughts ? The data is normalized N(0,1). I did try changing the learning rate, but it does not help much, the lower end of the error curve converges, but there are these intermittent spikes that keep going up.  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: I have implemented a different dataset model and now the process seems to converge. However, could me please explain why the process after successful convergence seems to be stuck with a message "Score at iteration # is -0.0" iterated forever? Is it something wrong again? 
solution: other than the high initial score, looks goodthere's no built-in termination conditions (in normal training, anyway)you can use early stopping for that if you need it. 

issue: Must be a huge dataset then. net.fit() just processes the given dataset once. Is it still logging new iterations or did it freeze? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: , Can you review the new code that I uploaded to my fork? I have created GenderRecordReader as per your suggestion. 
solution: 

issue: Hello, when I tried the SparkDl4jMultiLayer, I got errors when I tried to fit the training data in it. Can anybody help to see what is the issue? Sorry for the long stacktrace. Thank you@raver120 I post my logs in viyaGH/gist:ef9b0b130a19713dd13ef8a700dbe8ca

issue: Guys, I need help with MultiDataSetIterator and ImageRecordReader.I\'m trying to read the same image file with two different resolutions and feed them to ComputationGraph with two inputs and one output.Here\'s what I did:ImageRecordReader rr1 = new ImageRecordReader(25, 25, 3, labelMaker); //ParentPathLabelGeneratorImageRecordReader rr1s = new ImageRecordReader(13, 13, 3, labelMaker);rr1.initialize(trainData);rr1s.initialize(trainData);MultiDataSetIterator trainDataIterator = new RecordReaderMultiDataSetIterator.Builder(1)                .addReader("rr1", rr1)                .addReader("rr1s", rr1s)                .addInput("rr1", 0, 0)                .addInput("rr1s", 0, 0)                .addOutput("rr1", 1, 1)                .build();Is this correct way to do it?

issue: AlexDBlack: Hi ,I want to run Mnist  Example on  distributed GPUs with Spark and I have a pseudo distributed spark with the GPU which I set up CUDA ready. When I submit the jar ,it has an Error: No CUDA devices were found in system. it is a problem related to the pseudo distributed spark? 
solution: This can give you some hints on how to setup cuda/spark. 

issue: treo: strictly speaking, we could do that. it's sum of squared errors (basically MSE minus the mean)following tensorflow in that respect (though I just noticed we differ by a constant factor of 2) they also have the same local minimum, though scale of gradients may vary between them 
solution: 

issue: I think I finally managed to "solve" my rnn regression problem. well Ive just had problems understanding how to do look back for RNN, ie predict time step 101  based on timesteps 1-100. One issue I had was that NormalizerMinMaxScaler didn't work with 3d data in 0.6, only NormalizerStandardize did. So I built from master yesterday where that issue was fixed 
solution: 

issue: another possible workflow with ec2 (if you just want to run a few things quickly, and don't need to automate) is to upload your jar to s3 and add it as a step in the ec2 management console oh, I meant emr, not ec2 :) 
solution: 

issue: dan-lind: got a link for that? can't find anything in their docs about it Mi5ke: for that example specifically? no. could be a tuning related issue 
solution: 

issue: well, if model gives 0.985 precision via evaluation checks, i doubt it\'s "not working" 
solution: 

issue: Sure - I am mystyfied too - I just added a couple of lines to pull the weights, and draw them:NINDArray w = ((MultiLayerNetwork) model).getLayer(0).paramTable().get("W"); then loop through the data, and draw it anyway you like... ok 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: yeah that is my understanding. And to do the same for dl4j, "Use N steps of lookback/history before starting to predict things", I just input a 3d INDArray right? Hm, isn't is example 4 that shows how to use masking for many-to-one ? otherwise I have clearly missed something using SequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator.AlignmentMode.ALIGN_END OK, so that's what I'm doing. But thats for training only right? 
solution: 

issue: Mi5ke: take a look at [<-LINK->] as you can see there the weights there also take some time until they approach something like that :) 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I have a short question to the example (word2vecsentiment): I get an error like "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Cannot allocate new FloatPointer(900000000),[...]". Do I have a chance to fix this by the running-options or is it simply that I have to less RAM? (i have 8gb) *too little raver119: thanks for that. i already tried it with Xmx6G, but it still doesn\'t work. The strange thing is, that if I print the (double) (Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory()) / 1024/1024, I get "109.0" (MB). ok, but with Xmx6g i still get the same error. alright, got it. I'll try to run it on another machine.

issue: I loaded the Google word2vec model using model = (Word2Vec) WordVectorSerializer.loadGoogleModel(gModel, true); and then I want to find the layer size by using model.getLayerSize(), but this doesn't return me the correct layer size -- it should be 300, but what it returns is 100. Is there any good way to get layer size of a loaded model? thanks. ok, I will check if that's filed, and will file one bug ticket if not been filed yet. thank you! and thanks for the pointer to the other method. raver119: just submitted an issue for the bug [<-ISSUE->] my pleasure, and thanks for your help. 
solution: 

issue: the dl4j roadmap states that RL is "nice to have". I looked at rl4j, but couldn\'t get the examples working (dependency and compilation issues). When can we expect rl4j to be fully integrated and documented? cloned rl4j from github, then followed a thread that provided an updated pom.xml to resolve dependency issues (something like 0.6.1-SNAPSHOT -> 0.6.0), then there was a compilation issue (gym.space -> space), then some doom dependency was missing, and then I gave up. 
solution: 

issue: I finally was able to launch the dl4j ui and start the training for reconstruction RNN. Thanks for the help dl4j team! I ended up using docker. Running it on Mac is still an issue. 
solution: 

issue: mburo: reflection stuff is to allow for custom functionality (custom layers, graph vertices, loss functions, input preprocessors etc) and still be able to use JSON serializationwhich is necessary for model serializer and spark to function with custom stuffit's done once per JVM and on my PC it's around a second or so. Reviewing the code, I can see some one way to speed that up a bit 
solution: 

issue: Whenever you see that kind of error that means you mis configured the neural net's inputs or outputs

solution: 

issue: I trained a model to classify images as object/non-object... it is working well for prediction.. However with some images it returns me a vector [?,?] that means no prediction or 50-50% i can't understand. the new videos posted are very clear to understand than the book materials and online docs.. I appreciate that work... the convolutionalIterationListener can only visualize if the input images are color but returns error for grayscale images.. can anyone tell what the prediction with '?' means instead of digits  [?,?] instead of [1,0] or [0,1] EdeMeijer: code or ouput? 
solution: 

issue: so far, the examples related to sequences deal with texts of natural languages (with known delimiters), whereas there are other kind of sequences like DNA sequences, protein sequences with no delimiters. Can you please recommend me the closest example to my issue, to start from. 
solution: 

issue: Hello All, I am a beginner of dl4j, and trying to build up a net to predict log errors, but the result seems incorrect, I have no idea what's the problem, so any of your help would be much appreciated. For the training data, there are 6 columns, the first 5 are input data, the last column is the result(the result scope is integer from 1 to 19). here is the error information: [<-LINK->] the code: [<-LINK->] The training and testing data: [<-LINK->] Thanks a lot in advance! 
solution: not a single dataset, like you did. 

issue: open an issue - or send us a pull requestthe docs are open source too: [<-LINK->] !issue 
solution: 

issue: Isn't your prediction 1 step too early then? I mean, at time step n it will be predicting time step n+1 after all 
solution: It doesn't quite capture the quadratic curve in the overall data, but that's understandable. 

issue: Thanks@AlexDBlack, so, you mean I needn't to normalize the test data? ? as for the training data, is it ok when I use the three steps below? :      preProcessor.fit(trainIter);     trainIter.setPreProcessor(preProcessor);      preProcessor.transform(trainDataSet);       I am really confused with the usage of normalizer, thanks for your help 
solution: Is it right? : for training data, I need to use the two step:  preProcessor.fit(trainIter);  trainIter.setPreProcessor(preProcessor);   for the  testing data: preProcessor.fit(trainIter);  trainIter.setPreProcessor(preProcessor); and preProcessor.transform(testInputFeatures)?. 

issue: Can anyone tell me were I can get help on ND4J issues. I am having trouble with the BLAS back-end.  I have been able to use the native and GPU back-ends. But BLAS seems to fail me. I have check the use of OpenBLAS and R picks it up ok. Can you tell please me were this is documented. I would like to know what other back-ends I may experiment with. BTW I looked at the GIT issues and I did see [<-ISSUE->] , so BLAS is native? I also did not get netlib-java to work but the issue seems to suggest otherwise. raver119: Ok, thanks.

issue: I am trying to extract parts-of-speech with following code in Android Project. [<-CODE->] However it didn’t work because one of the dependencies (beans.java.Introspector) is not supported in Android. This class is used in uimaj-core library. So I recompiled uimaj-core after replacing java beans library with droid-java-beans (https://github.com/dthommes/droid-java-beans).This fixed that problem, but it turned out that uimafit-core uses java.beans.PropertyEditorSupport which is not supported as well. I am not sure if recompiling dependencies is a good way to fix the problem. Is there any better way to get parts-of-speech (nouns, verbs etc) in Android project.

issue: Sorry if I'm repeating myself. I've playing around with an RNN classification problem where I want to predict 3 classes. After running about 50 epochs my model basically ends up ignoring two classes and always predicts the third. What could cause this? 
solution: 

issue: can I do that when prediciting every timestep? I've only seen masking with regards to many-to-one/one-to-many 
solution: but you'll have to code something for that yourself I think. 

issue: I suppose I could check that I got the basics right: the net predicts only the label field? when given a labelindex/csvcolunn and number of classes as 1, it should give out guesses on that label? these guesses are the predicted price movements that I want out? hmm, ok, I've got 1 as the number of classes/labels, but Ihaven''t normalized, so I'll do that then. ah, there was a reason I didn't do it before.  I get a nullpointer exception, the code is pretty much vanilla but in scala.  the traindata and testdata are vars so they should be mutable. [<-LINK->] here's the relevant codesnippet. its just vanilla so I'm guessing scala to be the culprit. [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: that  normalilze error could be a genuine bug.  The code is straight out of an example, same data runs through training no problem and the only moving bit is scala.

issue: I have just installed the latest dl4j examples on an aws DeepLearning AMI which already has all the nvidia driver, etc installed.  Using the command line is there some simple way to test that everything is working and that gpus are being used? Using the runexamples.sh script I was able to run the some of the examples. However, I seeo.n.n.NativeOpsando.n.n.Nd4jBlas. I guess that means I am using cpu, no? 
solution: yeah, it defaults to cpu... in theory you can just change the nd4j backend property. 

issue: Hey guys, is there already an estimate when 0.7.0 will be released? 
solution: as soon as few last gradients check will pass. couple of hours.

issue: What's restored Model ? I have shared the code for training model and the  place where I am calling that model 
solution: xuzonghan: that sounds like a sequence classification problemthe most appropriate example we have is this: [<-LINK->] that classifies sentences (well, movie reviews) into positive or negative... same principle could be applied to your task. it could be that you haven't tuned your network (i.e., don't have good settings for network hyperparameters like learning rate or layer size)that's a common reason for your network not learning anything.

I only have two labels however (negative and positive) and there is a ConvolutionalLayer + PoolingLayer set before the OutputLayer. I'm trying to understand how this 70000-element vector ends up in LossMCXENT. Ok it seems that the labels property of the DataSets are indeed just the same as the actual data. That can't be right? Ok I think I'm just an idiot :S Nope still not working. I think I've found the issue. CSVRecordReader can't be used together with a BalancedPathFilter label maker.

issue: hi everyone, I'm quite new to ML and DL4J so sorry for the noob question, but the basic example [<-LINK->] isn't running properly for me, when I run it i get a few exceptions and it stops  [<-LINK->] I've just ran the MLPMnistSingleLayerExample.java from the dl4j-examples folder sorry, you're right! I've tried the right one, but the outcome is the same :(  [<-LINK->] 
solution: so you just don't have required prerequisites for spark examples to run. 1) Use non-spark examples, there's plenty of them. 

issue: thx! Where could I find the non-spark examples? :) what about linux, is it not obligatory for DL4J? 
solution: but i'd suggest to go with standalone examples for now, probably you just don't need spark/hadoop right now, since you don't get the problem. 

issue: I have a dataset that contains one flattened image (actually a flattened CSV file) that should be associated with exactly one label. If I look at the dataset object in the debugger, however, I see that the "dataset.labels.data" property is "[0.0, 1.0"]. How can this be possible? Or does this mean that the label is "1" since the second entry  is "1" and "[1, 0] would mean "label 0" But if this was the case, why are these floats? 
solution: 

issue: ruichernob: do you mean "how to get data back to jvm?"? that\'s what i\'ve meant by "get back to jvm" so there's 2 scenarios, but they are close 1) if you have regular INDArray, you go for INDArray.data().asInt() (or asFloat(), asDouble())

issue: Hello,I recently got into machine learning and was reading about the RBM.I want little more intuitions to how this work and probably implement a very small code frameworkto exacly see dats happening.Can someone help? 
solution: 

issue: Hello , I was wondering if anyone can clarify. I have a DenseLayerNetworkConfiguration (standard feedforward network 1 input 1 output used for regression). I have trained the network using "net.fit(iterator)". And I am able to review the results of the training using "net.output(x, false)". Now I want to do some forward testing, so I want to supply it some input and predict what the output should be. Should I continue to use the output method? or is there a predict or I noticed "rnnTimeStep"

issue: hi guys, when i load a model in my project, i have a lot of logs of org.reflections.Reflections, that scans all my resource folder for a long time. why? it is mandatory? 
solution: EdeMeijer: yeah, but i can't ignore the time required :). 

issue: so your accuracy improves but your F1 doesn't? F1 is a combination of precision and recall, and if either of them is very bad, your F1 won't change much 
solution: but a bad F1 score.

issue: vjames19: it's up to the JVM garbage collector, essentiallybut we'll call the GC on low off-heap memoryis there a use case where you need to manually deallocate? that might be fixed on 0.7.0, you'd have to test or check with@raver119 speaking of... @/allLatest DL4J release - 0.7.0 - is now available on maven centralwe will be updating the examples shortly 
solution: 

issue: liulhdarks: it's a known issue with the presets for OpenCV right now. Just call something likeNd4j.create(1)before anything else Well, there's something somewhere in your application that is loading/usr/lib64/libgomp.so.1.0.0on your system before the one from ND4J loads. You'll need to figure out what that is and initialize ND4J before that. Java runs static initializers before the main() method uninstall/usr/lib64/libgomp.so.1.0.0and see what fails to load and remove that Or use Docker ;) 
solution: 

issue: Hi even my score is very low in graph, but my accuracy is just 0.78. is it because overfitting?  [<-LINK->]

solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: Hi Alex, in your visualization example: [<-LINK->] , the attach command is missing. (Step 2) uiServer.attach(statsStorage); 
solution: AlexDBlack: , I think I am using old release. It does not show fitLabel function.. 

issue: no it's just 0.7.0 please follow the examples for versioning if you're not sure what to put please don't guess 
solution: Adam: , It was there in the source code I just downloaded..  [<-LINK->]. This says otherwise. 

issue: @AlexDBlack Now that the new release is out I\'ll bother you a bit with my previous problem :DWhile using Arbiter for finding a configuration for RNN-LSTM networks (TS prediction -> regression) I get weird results.When a model was found with a score which is > 0  (e.g., using RegressionValue.RMSE)  I can use the built net to predict the next results.But (in my case) commonly a configuration is found which has a really small score (e.g., score = 0.00001 or similar).With such a model, calling: [<-CODE->] produces an output like: []I\'ve already tried to normalize/denormalize the labels and also calling  "DataTypeUtil.setDTypeForContext(DataBuffer.Type.DOUBLE);" before I run anything. But that does not seem to help.Any ideas what could cause such a behaviour?

issue: about the problem "Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /tmp/javacpp43406842965514772/libjnind4j.so: /usr/lib64/libgomp.so.1.0.0: version `GOMP_4.0\' not found (required by /tmp/javacpp43406842965514772/libnd4j.so)".   I find the lib "libgomp.so.1.0.0" and ""libgomp.so.1" has exist in my machine, so when nd4j load libgomp.so, it load libgomp.so.1.0.0 which require libgomp.so.1, it caused the conflict. so how can I let nd4j load the libgomp.so.1 in the jars instead of libgomp.so.1.0.0 in the /usr/lib64? AlexDBlack: @agibsonccc 
solution: that doesn't sound right. 

issue: Ok, I just switched to 0.6.0. It's a massive change! From 0% GPU usage to about 30-50% 
solution: and run again. 

issue: jsteggink: I quickly looked in your config and saw you have tbpttBackLength and tbpttForwardLength configured (on 20), but your backprop type is standard. You should set backprop type to truncated BPTT if you want those settings to be useful. probably not related to perf, but still 
solution: Yeah, I noticed that too. 

issue: awongBisco: Yes you should be able to reverse and map the original image. We do not have  an example or visualization of that right now but always welcome contributions. 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I have a question. Why with word2vec I can't find the words nearest of a integer string ? If i use a minWordFrenquency of 1, any word can be find in word2vec ? 
solution: it’s not like w2v cares about what symbols you pass in :). julianmaster: also depends on what pre-processor you have set in your TokenizerFactory object.. 

issue: who knows, maybe there’s none. or maybe you’ve used something like CommonPreprocessor, or maybe you’ve cleared them out by using minWordFrequency threshold impossible to say without seeing actual w2v configuration i’m not sure i’m saving that in conf just call setter manually, and file and issue please 
solution: 

issue: I need to change the preprocessor to not delete number 
solution: just get CommonPreprocessor source, and modify regex according to your needs.

solution: 

issue: EdeMeijer: mklvars only sets up the enviornment in the current shell session, so you could try starting intellij from that shell how are you checking that mkl is picked up? have you set any additional environment variables? like MKL_THREADING_LAYER=GNU? (don't do it just yet :D) 
solution: 

issue: EdeMeijer: yep, as@raversaid you are measuring the array generation time, not actually the multiplication performance 
solution: hehe, I see, multiplication time is 1125ms in total. I somehow assumed that a multiplication would be more expensive than generating a random matrix. also only 5 iterations isn't that much, if your cpu automatically reduces its clockspeed, you will probably see wildly varying results.

solution: 

issue: Someone with Spark/YARN experience, please help. I'm trying to force my driver to run on a specific (less powerful) node by using node labels. I successfully added a 'driver' label to one of my nodes and enabled label based scheduling. I'm submitting a Spark job with--conf spark.yarn.am.nodeLabelExpression=driver, which should let the Application Manger (and thus the driver) run on my node labeled 'driver'. The thing is, nothing happens, the application stays on ACCEPTED state and is not being scheduled. Any clues? I can't find anything useful in the resource manager logs. I'm using DominantResourceCalculator Hmm, I think there's something about queues I'm missing. 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: spark sql is for labelled data, VectorUDT is an abstraction for vector, any user defined structure can be used in spark sql if you can or anyone can modify the training and prediction of your data processing pipeline with an aggregate function, it should work the problem is your dataset iterators are too complex to do it.

solution: 

issue: normalize.fit keeps choking on the data.  I get this error, I've done -Xmx, and also UseConcMarkSweep, which fixed the error with garbage collection..  Is normalize not lazy? Is there anything I can do besides buying more memory? [<-LINK->] sure, and yes I am. [<-LINK->] I've tried various methods of chopping it down..  Oriiginally I just thought iter.next would get the data in small batches lazily, but it doesn't seem to do it. 
solution: Okay, so the usage isn't like that. You fit once to get stats (mean, std dev etc) and then  set the preprocessor on the iterator. You don't have to call it within the loop every time. Each time .next is called on the iterator the transformation happens under the hood.

issue: it might also be lombok annotation maybe, expanded in binaries but not source? anyway, not a concern really 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: I just finished the normalizer.fit, or rather ended with the same error. outofmemory java heap space.  so any other things I can do besides buying more memory? oh well, it had the neural net definition in it. so I suppose I could make a new object completely.  but, it should've worked, it has no model.fit, nothing but the iterator, nn definition, and the csvsequencereader and iterator. 
solution: If you're running out of ram with just the normalization you either aren't giving it enough xmx or your problem is too big.

Any suggestion/help much appreciated.Thank you 
solution: 

issue: is there any way to ask to normalizer to normalize each training case, but not whole data set? 
solution: yes, but it's not too practical - without knowledge of stdDev, mean, max, min etc etc. I understand that normalization of each training case may be not very practical, but still want to give it a try. I believe that for my learning task it can be more useful then normalizing whole data set.

issue: So what's your experience with dealing with big outliers in training data? On one hand, my model seems to ignore them appropriately, but they make assessing the overall quality of my model and interpreting training scores a bit tricky. And it's not actually very trivial to automatically identify outliers 
solution: 

issue: raver119: need some help with DeepWalk (the older implementation). Yesterday when I was looking at the vectors, most of them had values in them, but now I can't get the same code somehow training (all vectors for all concepts have 0.0 or -0.0 as values). I have a graph of about 40k vertices and 500k edges. I tried directed and undirected edges. Everything is fine when I look at the instance. Then I used a window of 10 (I tested with many others), a vector size of 128, a learning rate of 0.1 (I tested with many others) and a walk length of 3 (I tested with many others).  Once I fit the model and I investigate the trained vectors using lookupTable() on the DeepWalk object, and then getVertexVectors() and finally getRow() on the NDArray, all the values of each of the 128 columns are 0.0 or -0.0. Any pointers as to why this can happen? Am I missing something? 
solution: 

issue: I understood we can use different weights for scaling the error of multiple outputs since 0.7.0, but how does this work again? Ah, it's a property of the loss function, never mind

issue: lgp66: Welcome! Here's a link to Deeplearning4j's Gitter Guidelines, our documentation and other DeepLearning resources online. Please explore these and enjoy! [<-LINK->] 
solution: lgp66: sounds like that's a task for CustomLayer, yes.. 

issue: does the N x (graphic card) contribute an N increase in throughput and N factor of decrease in training time? or is there another bottleneck? 
solution: it's a sub-linear scaling obviously due to synchronization... unless you do things like training entirely separate models (for hyperparameter optimization, different data sets etc)but hopefully it should be close to linear with something like parallel wrapper. 

issue: Hi, I\'m new to d4j. Running the MLPClassifierLinear I can see the training errors and the final scores with a message at the end stating that "Process finished with exit code 0". I guess that means it run without errors, but I cannot see the graph that PlotUtil is suppose to render. Any ideas why I do not see the graph? I appreciate any insight :) I believe I do not have any problems with the installation, the learning do take place, it is the rendering of the graph from PlotUtil that does not work. Any ideas why? Yes I did not close any window... At least not intentionally :) Which is the chart window, the one where the graph is suppose to show up? I do not see any popping windows... 
solution: 

issue: okey how to obtain the current input to the vertex? 
solution: basically I want to know whether all the input is fed to the vertex, and each vertex runs in parallel if they are not sequential.... setInput is for storage of the required inputs only; your layer/vertex should use those stored inputs only when doForward is calledit's up to the ComputationGraph to decide when to call doForward.

issue: edb2016: no, no relationship at all between tbptt lengths and  minibatch size... read this: [<-LINK->] (and please don't go tagging everyone in sight... somebody will get back to you) minibatch size has nothing to do with time series length, basically...you can have 1 example of length 1000, or 50 examples of length 1000either way, tbptt length of 100 would make sense there 1000/100 = 10 splits (10 parameter updates) per input each circle in that diagram represents multiple RNN units unrolled over time

issue: Hello Community,i just started playing around with deeplearning4j an i\'ve been really enjoying it. When trying out the "examples/convolution/AnimalClassification" - example i tried gathering more training data in order to improve the results of the shipped setup. I collected roughly a thousand pictures of each cats and dogs and tried running the network with them. the pictures are all size 1080 x 1080 px and when I .init() the network I get a OutOfMemoryError exception Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Cannot allocate new FloatPointer(87626434), totalBytes = 789475818, physicalBytes = 1154048000if anyone has any ideas how to work around this i can supply stack trace + source code!Greetz! whats a reasonable size for pictures like animals?

issue: EdeMeijer: , I have trained weather data according to our discussion. Now, I am using rnnTimeStep to predict temperature of next 24 hour half-hourly. But, when I print INDArray returned by rnnTimeStep it gives me floating point values. My input was integer number so output should be integer too. below is the code.  [<-CODE->] I get following output output : [0.80, 0.74, 0.79, 0.96, 0.83, 0.74, 0.69, 0.70, 0.78, 0.63, 0.71, 0.75, 0.65, 0.65, 0.60, 0.68, 0.60, 0.47, 0.64, 0.47, 0.61, 0.38, 0.55, 0.53, 0.36, 0.30, 0.44, 0.51, 0.44, 0.47, 0.44, 0.56, 0.47, 0.27, 0.36, 0.45, 0.42, 0.30, 0.43, 0.34, 0.43, 0.33, 0.19, 0.35, 0.22, 0.34, 0.15, 0.45] 
solution: well, it's a regression problem, and you've normalized your labels (i.e., target data)so you undo the normalization to get the predictions in the original range, using this: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: OS:LinuxJava: 1.7DL4J: 0.7.0CUDA: 7.5AWS g2.2xlargeI've tried running a variant of the Lecun example in AWS using both a GPU instance (g2.2xlarge) and a large multi CPU instance (m4.4xlarge 16 cpus).

solution: 

issue: gks141270: , every now and then you also have to ask yourself, should it work? in the end NN is just a fancy term for statistics. if our inputs and outputs do not have meaningful connection, it will not work not saying that this is the case, but this is something you should ask yourself, from time to time 
solution: gks141270: no one global updater is usually fine.. But at this point it's really a matter of tuning, can't really help you with that. There's a gitter channel dedicated to that at [<-LINK->] , you might have more luck there.. 

issue: here: has anyone successfully added dl4j-core to a spring (boot) application?  I'm struggling with jackson conflicts: Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.joda.cfg.FormatConfig agibsonccc: @AlexDBlackWickedness!  I just needed to use 0.7!!  I hope dl4j works out cause i don't want to inject python in my pipeline lol 
solution: 

issue: shiehn: also: as of 0.7.0 we've shaded jackson (i.e., no longer a deeplearning4j-core dependency)... except for the UI and spark (jackson is transitive via play and spark there)so if you are still on 0.6.0, you might try upgrading? 
solution: shiehn: I deleted your message. 

issue: jakobkirkegaard: yes please do share your keras config JSON file if possible so I can reproduce your error. But that's a really surprising error -- looks like Jackson is having trouble parsing the config. That might indicate the keras config is malformed. 
solution: 

issue: dmmiller612: i'm going to implement it for 0.8.0, next major release, together with deepwalk and general w2v overhaul so it's just absent for now. w2v/d2v/dw already got overhaul in 0.7.0, and is already way faster then before yep, new spark impl for nlp will be using nice parameter server instead of bully transfers over network i'd suggest to use standalone for now or come back in 7-10 days i hope i'll have proper working poc within 1-2 weeks, depending on other issues & bandwidth

issue: I have weather series data ranging from 90 to 500. I am using normalizer. But, normalized data does not remain between -1 to 1. goes below or above -1 to 1. What should I do to keep them between -1 to 1? Thanks, I am using RNN with LSTM for my weather data. Is it good to use MinMaxNormalizer with it? I am not sure whether I need to keep data beteen -1 to 1. I was reading a DL4J troubling shooting page ( [<-LINK->] ) where Data Normalization section talks about it. Ok, then my data is normalized properly, right?

solution: okay cool. On another note, it would be great if you could change the visibility of ParameterAveragingTrainingMaster constructor that takes the Builder to public or add a setter for exportDirectory. Sometimes, people don't have write access to the default dir.

issue: I have a question about how nd4j find the location of native .so files.  All native .so files are packaged into a nd4j-native-0.7.0-linux-x86-64.jar file. But when javacpp loads .so libraries, normally it needs java.library.path to find the .so libraries. But I didn't find this setting.  so I wonder how javacpp find the location of native .so files. But when I was trying a simple example of javacpp, it said UnsatisfiedLinkError. I have to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to suppress it. I have the .so file on my classpath.

For example i have the following time series: [<-CODE->] And want to predict what would be the 4th time step I based my code on this example [<-LINK->] If we make it work i will do a pull request with the example :D 
solution: Does the message means the application can' create the directory because it already exists?. 

issue: tomymehdi: the indexes etc there look ok... what's the issue/question?you can't get good predictions? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: the predictions output is just one number so it's not usefull. What i still don't get is why on the example of the sentence it uses the index on the array of posibilities and here i use just 0 and 1 AlexDBlack: i can send you a gist with the 2 examples i'm working 
solution: you are building a  multi-dimensional array with 2 values - open and close - at each time step. open has index 0, close has index 1. 

issue: Hi guys, I am having the same issue as yesterday, and this after I created a MultidatasetIterator as you suggested.  Here is the gist [<-LINK->] would appreciate guys if you have some pointers as to why the exception is happening (see gist). I've added some of the code in the gist. Not sure if the problem is in vector1 /vector2 AlexDBlack: could you please take a look at this gist [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Hi, when I studied the code in [<-LINK->] , from line 117 to line 141, I dont understand why it writes in this way. For example, why we need to put value into featuresMask for every i and j (featuresMask.putScalar(temp, 1.0);), whereas we just put value into labelsMask for every i, but just just one value of j (labels.putScalar(new int[]{i,idx,lastIdx-1},1.0)), I know I miss some knowledge here. Could you guide me what kind of tutorial I should refer to? and in line 135 & 141, the comment says "time step", what is time step? I dont quite understand 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: I think the issue is maybe on how I am creating the vectors (vector1/vector2) but my data is consistent  [<-CODE->] AlexDBlack: , I am merging the multidatasets in the snippet I posted. Could there be anything wrong, code-wise? another snippet  [<-CODE->] AlexDBlack: the issue is happening when I call fitMultiDataSet. The exception is raised in  themerge2dof MultiDataSet method 
solution: 

issue: Not sure if this is new, but started getting this with 0.7.0: [<-CODE->] mkl isn't free, is it? 
solution: there's a community edition now.  [<-LINK->]. yeah. 

issue: @AlexDBlack Thanks again for all the feedback, sorry for my lack of knowdlege i will overcome it with effort. I made a big advance using the tests suggested and want to know what are the most probable causes to get atrocious predictions. I'm guessing the following:amount of the data set is too small\nIt takes arround 15 epoch to converge in R^2 error, so it can be the network layers are too big and is memorizing too fastUsing what we talked i ended up with this:https://gist.github.com/tomymehdi/3adb1274097ed22f4c73654ea474f133

solution: 

issue: The module deeplearning4j-ui(version 0.7.0) run on jdk1.8, but my production environment is 1.7.Is there any other version run on jdk1.7? 
solution: 

issue: I thought someone at DL4J would like to know:  The PredictGenderTrain  dl4j example frequently does not learn/converge (~50% error through all epochs).   It seems to work reliably when I reduce the   learningRate = 0.005;//GF was .01      So, you might update source code. FYI: when it doesn\'t converge, it repeatedly gets:  "o.d.optimize.solvers.BaseOptimizer - Hit termination condition on iteration 0" errors. agibsonccc: Sorry, I'm not that sophisticated with GIT yet. 
solution: 

issue: Hi, Do I need to randomize the order of my training data for every Epoch? 
solution: people typically do with SGD yes. if you have balanced batches it should be fine though. 

issue: Adam: saw that example. can follow that and make that work on my data. Not sure how to go from that to converting my text data into matrix of vectors and send to a classifier 
solution: 

issue: is there anyway I can condition what values an Op runs on? taking the ln of 0 isn't particularly useful >.< 
solution: 

issue: Hi, is there any best practices to avoid frequent Java Full GC while training, like every 2 seconds. All I did in one iteration is just inverse a 10x10 matrix, and multiply it with  a bigger matrix (10x20000).  A training epoch cost about 10^6 iterations. this is how I implement is now:INDArray inverse = InvertMatrix.invert(YtY.add(YtCu_IY).addi(lambdaI), true); INDArray inverseYt = inverse.mmul(Y.transpose()); 
solution: if you're hitting that close to the memory anyways. 

issue: I would start with trying dl4j 0.7.0 A lot of the Reflections and scanning stuff have been fixed However, that doesn't explain any crashing In fact, it's not crashing, it's getting a SIGTERM 16/08/25 21:53:24 ERROR executor.CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend: RECEIVED SIGNAL 15: SIGTERM Because of some timeout it seems Can you put your code in a gist? No your hadoop version should be fine 
solution: 

issue: daanvdn: I don't see any of the log messages in your code appear in your log output, so it's hard to see how far it got oh, I see Weird, I'm doing a lot of Spark training and never seen any annoying Akka log messages appear If there's memory issues you should at least see something in the logs I'd say Really, try upgrading DL4j and Spark, and see if it improves Okay, so it does actually work What OS are you using btw? 
solution: I don't think it's default on CentOS so don't worry about that. 

issue: Investigating why a Keras (theano backend) model and the (supposed to be) equivalent dl4j model imported using your new import functionality does not agree on class probabilities for  a single validation image. When importing the network config and weights in dl4j I get the following warnings [<-LINK->] . Could these be relevant for the differing model evaluations (I am ignoring training for now). 
solution: 

issue: perceptoid: are you going to open an issue for the dropout problem when using keras model? it would be great! perceptoid: the problem is not obvious for me (I don't know enough of the internal working of dl4j) but it seems it was for@raver119and@agibsonccc. Dropout has different meaning in keras and dl4j ok. so no need to open an issue to track it down? 
solution: 

issue: benqua: I'm doing some tests to learn more. If the problem is obvious feel free to open the issue - I can't describe it just yet. 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I am looking at documentation that loads images. In alle examples so far it uses ParentPathLabelGenerator to attach labels to images. It happens to be the case that I have the labels written in seperate file. Is there an example where images and labels are loaded seperately? 
solution: Yeah, and the Spark UI can give you some similar visualizations. 

issue: daanvdn: in principle, with a large enough net and data, it could take a while between averagingsbut I suspect something else might be going on...best way to debug that might be to collect stats as per this example: [<-LINK->] that'll give you a nice timeline graph showing you what is going on... right, that's worth looking at as well for sure. ours breaks things down a bit more (network initialization, waiting for data to be loaded, doing fit operation, etc) someonedeep:  [<-LINK->] you can implement your own label generatorbasically given a URI (path) -> return new Text("ClassLabelHere") 
solution: 

issue: benqua: - yeah struggled a bit with this myself as I thought modelimport was an official part of the release available on maven repos etc - but I guess not. I ended up building everything from scratch as described here: [<-LINK->] benqua: at least from the official version 0.7.0 that is... 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: thanks, also I am not sure I understand your answer  I'm confused... If I could import org.deeplearning4j.nn.modelimport.keras.Model just by adding [<-LINK->] as a dependancy, I would just do it. I am asking because it doesn't work. I am not willing to use snapshots, release is perfectly fine for me; I am just trying to make it work. Anyway, thanks for your amazing work. I will try again and fill an issue later on if necessary. 
solution: 

issue: brain freeze again.  about cnn... if I don't have image files, but csv with: 1,2,3,4, 0...; how do I get this into [[1,2],[3,4]],0 so that my network understands it as input? everything was working as long as I had 1x1x4 but 1x2x2 is giving me a headache 
solution: daredemo: you can either reshape your INDArrays, or just specify flat as input type. 

issue: in conv filters I want to use filters such as 5x5, if I make my input flat, don't I lose that option because now my input is 1x25? 
solution: memory in x86 architecture is flat anyway.. 

issue: Hi i'm back again,  I was reading the page on your website about the sentence iterator and it appears to be what i need but i can't seem to get it to work.  It doesn't seem to exist according to Eclipse so i was wondering if it was removed or if im missing a jar. 
solution: Yes i am making a neural network to read text and respond to it so though that a sentence iterator would work best.  But when i try to add one to my code it says that it cannot be resolved to a type. 

issue: turambar: Hi - yeah, had some trouble getting the same probability output from dl4j and keras (see [<-ISSUE->] ) -@agibsoncccsuggested it could be related dropout due to the warnings. I can reproduce the behaviour for a slimmed down MNIST network where I cannot reproduce the class probabilites that I see in Keras. Everything should be attached to the issue (keras train/eval and dl4j eval code). Could be related to dropout (due to warnings) - or my boilerplate code. turambar: Thanks - another verification could be to try loading the json/h5 from the issue and calculate the probabilities (the java code for this is in the attached zip). I am not at my dev pc right know - will test tomorrow. turambar: - ok thanks for testing. At least the minimal test code should help find the root cause - but please rule out any boilerplate errors first - I am new to both keras and dl4j. 
solution: 

issue: If I have calculated the output for all labels, is 0.5 and greater guaranteed to be the highest compared to all other labels? raver119: Thanks, this helps my coding. But also to confirm the theory is it the case? At least > 0.5 of course? Or spoken different is the sum of the output probabilities always 1? 
solution: and to get actual highest index - there’s argMax() call :). 

issue: AlexDBlack: I see ok. . I'm just trying to calculate the complexity. So if you have a LSTM module like the one listed. and you feed it  a sequence of 10 timesteps , then for each time step you have a forward pass, then a backward pass where 15 params are updated. So 10215? AlexDBlack: that's 10 multiplied by 2 multiplied by 15 param updates 
solution: in terms of computational complexity (big-O etc): you need to also take into account the layer sizes, as mmul operations are not linear in the input size. 

issue: I would like to clarify a detail point in the implementation of skipgram of dl4j. In the original paper "Distributed representation of words and ... compositionality", in equation (4), there are 2 vector spaces: syn0 and syn1neg. The central word w_I is in one space, and the "lastword" and the sampling words are in another space. But in the dl4j implementation, the lastword is in space syn0, and the central (target) word and the sampling words are in another space syn1neg. Is my understanding correct? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I'm using the latest version of dl4j (0.7.0). I also want to usedl4j-spark_2.11v0.7.0 anddeeplearning4j-ui_2.10v.0.7.0. in the same project. However when I try to instantiate aUIServerobject, I'm getting ajava.lang.NoSuchMethodError: scala.collection.immutable.HashSet$.empty()Lscala/collection/immutable/HashSet. The reason is a dependency conflict. It seems thatdl4j-spark_2.11pulls inscala-libraryv2.11.7, whereasdeeplearning4j-ui_2.10requiresscala-libraryv2.10.5. Does that mean I can't use the UIServer together with spark? I tried excludingscala-libraryfromdl4j-spark_2.11but that causes stuff indl4j-spark_2.11to no longer work. Any idea how to fix this? 
solution: or if it’s view, then INDArray.dup().data().asDouble(). 

issue: Good Morning (again!) Trying to run arbiter and trying to figure out how to create the DataProvider<DataSetIterator> from RecordReaderDataSetIterator. Trying  DataSetIterator dataTrain = new MultipleEpochsIterator(nTrainEpochs, new RecordReaderDataSetIterator(rr, 64)); but this is not splitting the dataset correctly. How to I create a  DataProvider from a RecordReaderDataSetIterator? agibsonccc: Can I use SplitTestAndTrain? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I am evaluating and optimizing different setups and persisting the network after some hours of learning. Is there an easy way to store the configuration of the network in a readably format (beside of the binary representation). So is it possible to see its setup and config and probably also the scoring to have an overview at a later time. agibsonccc: Thanks, will check. All this relates to persisting, you might remember we shortly spoke about the normalizer also to be persisted, you said you think of a new pipeline concept. Is there an issue to it already I could monitor? I am wondering if you have a separated work plan issuing with Skymind? Aside from the communitiy? 
solution: 

issue: I’ve ran into that iterateWithMiniBatches too. I thought there was a@Deprecatedannotation. 
solution: I just fogot about it. 

issue: jvence: in a lot of respects your question has nothing to do with arbiterarbiter just needs 2 DataSetIterators, exactly as you would use locally [<-LINK->] so ListDataSetIterator, ExistingDataSetIterator are two options 
solution: 

issue: Can CSVSequenceRecordReader load features and labels from single file? Thanks,@AlexDBlack AlexDBlack: , example 2 talks about input and labels in same file, but each time series is in separate files. Can I have all time-series data in single file? 
solution: 

issue: I cant seem to figure it out: how do I add one instance/file to a DataSetiterator (or directly to DataSet)? I can't use InputSplit or NumberedFileInputSplit (easily) in my application... raw data, images in this case. on disk 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: (and@thhart) if you remember I proposed something along the lines of a pipeline based api for datavec some time ago. After writing up the (detailed) proposal I noticed that it would change so much that it wouldn't be even close to datavec anymore. So I've started implementing it from scratch to see if actually makes things better 
solution: 

issue: there was an issue previously where label assignment for image record reader, where train/test readers could be inconsistentbasically looks like that i.e., "good if the labels were switched" but that was fixed as of 0.7.0 
solution: 

issue: got a link? thanks 
solution: 

issue: Don't know if I can ask this here, but a question aboutdl4j-spark_2.11v0.7.0: if I want to use this lib with spark v1.6.3, would I have to compile the latter from source? It seems that the the binaries for spark 1.6.3 only come with scala 2.10. Is this correct? wmeddie: maybe a stupid question, but is there any difference in functionality betw dl4j-spark_2.10 and  dl4j-spark_2.11? 
solution: 

issue: what could i have done wrong when INDArray lables = dsTest.getLabels(); always gives back [1.0,0.0] for two classes, even though half of the times the second label should fire? 
solution: I have the feeling that when having only one sample in InputSplit is not the way to go. My task has two classes, but when i print String label1 = dsTest.getLabelName(1);, i get : Index requested is longer than the number of labels used for classification.. 

issue: any release notes for 0.7.1? AlexDBlack: thanks! 
solution: basically. not really anthing in the way of new features that I can think of. 

issue: same question, any release note for 0.7.1? or a tag that group the issues fixed in github? 
solution: even for bug fix release notes are valuable.. 

issue: main things fixed: openblas issue, cuda rng issue, datavec is back to 1.7 now. plus 100500 small bugs found meanwhile 
solution: 

issue: Granted upgrading a production hadoop or spark cluster is the stuff of nightmares. So it's only natural that it'll be stuck on old Java versions for a while. 
solution: agibsonccc: You should combine the two and make a DVD which has docker and a docker image with nexus running and all the DL4J required jars in it.. 

issue: internal maven is just convenience dl4j isn't that slow in a vm... using linux in a vm on windows it sometimes even outperforms the host my point is that putting it in a vm isn't usually a huge performance cost 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I have a previously trained MultiLayerNetwork (RNN-LSTM for regression) which I load using ModelSerializer.restoreMultiLayerNetwork(netFile);I noticed when I repeat my evaluations (loading network, making predictions, calculating RMSE,  plotting etc.) that every time a slightly different numerical output is generated. The input data and normalization procedure is always the same (Try1-MAPE: 0.2798, Try2-MAPE: 0.2717, Try3-MAPE: 0.2754, Try4-MAPE: 0.2644, etc.)Any ideas why such a behaviour is occurring? 
solution: 

issue: are you actually setting rng seed to anything? not sure if your model uses probs though 
solution: or before restoration. 

issue: Out of curiosity, did you ever try to run the Arbiter example in a for loop?In 0.6.0 I think, I wanted to find multiple models and their configuration (1 model for some specific use case).With a 16 GB RAM PC I've encountered pretty quick an OutOfMemory Exception. After each iteration it would consume more memory and not free anything.Will probably try it soon again with the new version, but not sure if there was anything done in this manner. 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: I doubt whether this issues is really solved: [<-ISSUE->] Are the data columns sorted accordingly? After training on a large dataset, my confusion matrix doesn't show a nice verical line, but has some shifts The training loss is nice and low It appears as if only the labels are sorted 
solution: 

issue: im having some problems with the backend... "Backend cant find GPU devices"... i have a NVidia GTX480, cuda 7.5 and ubuntu 14.04 
solution: have you updated pom.xml according to you environment?. and specify nd4j-cuda-7.5-platform instead. 

issue: Hi....  in order to make dl4-example works in my eclipse IDE, I changed some CSV path.  IN examples  MLPClassifierLinear  the path of linear_data_train.csv. It is normal? Ok....   there are not very important fix.  Only the path about CSV files. May be that I do some error with Maven modules.... 
solution: 

issue: raver119: a GTX1050 is going to worK? 
solution: fredysalazar: itshouldwork. it wont be really suitable for training, but for inference (model use) it should be possible to compile & use dl4j. 

issue: johndemic: take a look at [<-LINK->] xuzonghan: did your colleague have actual reasons for that? We support ALOT of algorithms weka doesn't They're meant to be used alongside each other Take a look at this for example: [<-LINK->] knime (a weka competitor) : [<-LINK->] also uses dl4j as its deep learning as does rapid miner china xuzonghan: if they want support feel free to sign up for a skymind support contract google won't build it for you we will That being said I don't see why the 2 have to compete we are typically meant for the data engineering team If your manager has an issue, feel free to send an email tohelp@skymind.io we send skymind engineers in to your office Google won't do that for you Are you located in china? 
solution: 

issue: did I just dream that there were AWS AMIs available for dl4j? Can't find any Perhaps it's just not in my region 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I want to use DL4J to train my model, but my big concern is about training speed. I just read an article [<-LINK->] , seems DL4J is kinda slow. I am wondering whether this article is misleading somehow? 
solution: 

issue: wait is this via maven or sbt? I'm sorry :D none of us use gradle I'm honestly not sure 
solution: I think in gradle you have to specify the scala version like maven right?. 

issue: no, it just means nobody bothered updating that page please do comparison yourself get current version and compare it's not really hard if you want - i can share setups with you 
solution: You are welcome to prove it to yourself but it seems like you're looking for the reasons NOT to use it :D. 

issue: thanks... I've been wanting to do something like this since 2003, but mindstorm is a closed box, VEX is too weak and using weak arm cpu my original idea in 2003 was to build a robot that uses swarm technique to collaborative robots then have like a dozen of them working together to do fun stuff it's the reason I got a 3D printer 
solution: one of the goals was to use CV to build racing robots that could drive around a track as fast as Mindstorm motors can go. 

issue: How can I make read data format .h5 (HDF5) into DataSetIterator? The data structure of my .h5 file is like this "/GroupA/Group*/(-DataSet1 -DataSet2 -DataSet3)". I can read it easily and assign it to NDArray but I dont how to assign it to DataSetIterator. Okay let me clarify your answer. You suggest me to chuck my own data without using DataSetIterator right? I never use that javacpp before. It probably takes me some time to really get what you suggest.

solution: 

issue: I am getting this error:  "Execute failed: Could not initialize class org.nd4j.linalg.factory.Nd4j"  Any ideas? yes, I am still using KNIME trying make this work in KNIME 
solution: 

issue: Hello, can anyone think of a reason why for Truncated Backpropagation the .tBPTTForwardLength(100) .tBPTTBackwardLength(100) would be different? surely they'd always be the same? 
solution: 

issue: Can DL4J work without GPUs? 
solution: Is there a setting to change in configuration if I don't have a GPU?. I just realized my JDK was 32 bit instead of 64, that would do it!. 

issue: it's either your pom file (I'd suggest starting with the examples for that)or your IDE (are you using eclipse, for example?) 
solution: but we've been doing support here a long time, and eclipse + maven is definitely something that comes up a lot. 

issue: Hello, we can I get the source code for ParameterAveragingTrainingMaster, seem like IDEA can't find the code for dl4j-spark_2.11:0.7.0.jar 
solution: you can right click on your project, go to maven and go under down load sources. 

issue: Hi, general question: is it possible to check (before starting training) if a network architecture is valid? For example, layer 1 out  is layer 2 in, or the network architecture would take up to much memory.. At this point, I get error message when starting training, but would be handy if  I could learn that before hand. 
solution: 

issue: someonedeep: isn't is up to you to make sure you use the same variables? layer1 out -> var1 ; layer2 in -> var1 problem solved 
solution: and nIn1=nOut2 is simple example, for which the constraint is simple.. But maybe more difficult dependencies exist.. 

issue: Hi! is there any guide on using dl4j and nd4j on android? 
solution: nd4j-native-platform should work fine there. thomprycejones: ^^^. 

issue: Hi. Is there an example of how to fit a series of (x,y) data stored on a Point2D array?I'm trying to rearrange RegressionMathFunctions example, but I can not correctly for my data.. 
solution: 

issue: the missing piece for me is if I haveJavaRDD<List<Writable>>after datavec transformation, how do I convert that toDataset? just iterate and copy values to INDArray? 
solution: 

issue: jarutis: the typical pipeline is to export to CSV after your transforms and then read it normally... as a general rule you really don't want the overhead of spark (or the need to keep the data as writables in memory) when doing local training (extra memory and GC pressure will slow things down) 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I'm new to DL4J and intend to use it with GPU GT 750 Ti can any road map about installing and the required dependency as I have lost from documentation? agibsonccc: No it geforce but right first I need to install it I am new to use Maven 
solution: 

issue: I was using the updated version of java 8after getting error I switched to java7 version but still got the error Unsupported major.minor version 51.0 yes 
solution: 

issue: I'm using linux mint with Eclipse and jdk 1.8 and it works for me 
solution: 

issue: hi guys heave good days with dl4j :D im have question : how to get white version (not binarize) from mnistdata  thanks you 
solution: there's a boolean variable for binarizing. davinchia: add more heap space then. 

issue: Pull request created: [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: Collection<String> nearestWords = wordVectors.wordsNearest(aWord, 10); this code will return a colletcion of strings,but sometimes,the size of nearestWords is 11,is that a bug? raver119: I change the new version and the problem has sloved 
solution: 

issue: approximation: 3x numParams + 2 x activations size params + gradients + updater state, all same size activations and errors, also same size as each other work that out, convert to bytes, essentially plus a bit extra for working arrays, prefetching etc 
solution: 

issue: @agibsoncccI can now see options to Run a class , my IDE was blocked (about 90 mins)  in importing the project,  looks my mac was crawling. Thanks Again for being patient and guiding me. @raver119I am new to IntelliJ as an IDE and my machine was blocked in building and importing the project. So all the options were not visible. Thanks 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: :  running the UIserver in  a separate jvm from the training is still not clear to me depedency-wise. For this to work you need to register aStatsListener(constructed with aStatsStorageRouter) with theMultiLayerNetwork. And this requires a dependency ondeeplearning4j-ui_2.10in the module where the training is done. That would mean I would still have all the transitive dependencies ofdeeplearning4j-ui_2.10on the classpath of the process where training occurs and this would again cause the dependency conflict upon on spark-submit no? I'm probably missing sth, but can't figure it out. Thanks 
solution: 

issue: I use service fabric, which nobody else uses nor do I really recommend it, but there I deploy the model files and etc as a versioned Data Package.  In my case it request-response makes the most sense so I have a Play Framework app that loads the model from the data package on startup. 
solution: 

issue: looking at the regression example, it is about finding a scalar value. what about if the output should be a vector? for example to find coordinates x,y,z just changing the nOut to 3 would be enough? or do I need to make other changes? because usually the input csv has single column for classes, but if I were to use [x,y,z] then I need 3 columns 
solution: 

issue: Does anyone ever have issues with the labels in DL4J? I've issues while evaluating the model I did@agibsoncccI'm using 0.7.0 I'm training and evaluating 71 classes 
solution: 

issue: joostdewit: did you try latest version? 0.7.1 
solution: 

issue: thhart: Rsync works great too.  Service Fabric is kind of stupid and you have to copy the entire thing to the cluster using thier powershell tools.  Not worth it unless your system is mostly C#. 
solution: 

issue: well, it might be not a bandwidth, but for complex systems sometimes it’s really hard to think ofALLpossible edge cases :( 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: I commented on the issue on Github: [<-ISSUE->] Thanks in advance, for taking the time to have a look 
solution: 

issue: hey folks how to I apply an exponent to an INDArray? I checked out thePowclass and the constructor takes an INDArray and a pow, but there doesn't seem to be a method to extract the result? i.e.:new Pow(input, pnorm).get() 
solution: Nd4j.getEcxecutioner().exec(your_op_here) and only then it’s either op.z() or exec returns something back. 

issue: but can Computation Graph be parallelized? when you separate the net, then you can go async to get perf advantages 
solution: but yes, internal parallelism for cg is something we’re looking at. I think setting up parallelization on CG like a tree would enable easy configurability and also super duper fast parallelization, utilizing async where possible. 

issue: wylmn: probably an internet connection issue. delete the /MNIST/ directory in your home directory and try again 
solution: 

issue: When using UNK symbol in word2vec, there is no place for it in huffman tree. But it is needed when using heiarchical softmax. Besides, current impl throw npe when serializing the vocab. Due to that the UNK is not in idxMap of vocabCache 
solution: 

issue: hey, does DL4J  have an implementaiton for deep belief nets? but stacking RBNs is not the same as DBN 
solution: 

issue: There is a subtle difference between DBN and stacked RBM. A DBN is several directed layers plus an undirected layer at the top, while RBM is undirected. So a DBN with only one hidden layer is just an RBM. But generally a DBN is not stacked RBM.  [<-LINK->] Figure 20.1

issue: Hello! Currently porting some examples to Clojure and so far have been successful, however I'm running into trouble with this line: Nd4j.dtype = DataBuffer.Type.DOUBLE; I've been getting a static field not found for Nd4j.dtype,  I looked at  the docs and didnt see a function that lets me set the datatype. I also noticed this line: Nd4j.factory().setDType(DataBuffer.Type.DOUBLE); and now I'm curious as to why both are needed This is the example Im working off of [<-LINK->] and here is a gist illustrating what is happening 
solution: 

issue: Is UimaSentenceIterator still up to date? I've been trying to import it in the DL4J examples but can't as it doesn't seem to exist. 
solution: 

issue: I think you might need to normalize your data.  Is it all values between -4.0 and 4.0 with zero mean? 
solution: 

issue: Building a TSNE but when I save to file the vectors are NaN. Any ideas why this might be? 
solution: wmeddie: I have built a simpler network : [<-LINK->]. wmeddie: there is no loss function LossFunctions.LossFunction.RMSE. 

issue: Good morning guys. I'm looking into [<-ISSUE->] a bit more,  but was wondering if there's any special logic for dealing with serialization of INDArrays or anything (couldn't find any). How is the off-heap data serialized? I see the DataBuffers in BaseNDArray are marked as transient, so they won't be serialized by the normal behaviour. 
solution: 

issue: I try test a simple Convolution Neural Network like in the example code. My input is three dimensional array 23,23,35 and label is one dimensional array of 20. I covert all the input into DataSet within class DataAccess. However, when I try to train my Neural Net, I got the "Unable to get number of of columns for a non 2d matrix" but all of the input are three dimensional. I really dont get it. Here the code  [<-LINK->] Here log file  [<-LINK->] wait but in the example is 28281 28,28,1 So It should be width height nChannels right 
solution: 

issue: so how can I specify the shape of my input? Is it like setInputType(InputType.convolutionalFlat(35,23,23))? 
solution: coming from your DataAccess class. when you set it to conviolutionalFlat, neural net expects 2D array. 

issue: AlexDBlack: Thanks a lot. The r^2 can be reached to 0.85 after did the normalization. Does any one know how to pre-process the training data in the circumstance that the input sequences (DNA/RNA) are not the same length? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: any luck with reproducing the issue? Need more info? 
solution: 

issue: Is there a way I stack an INDArray on top of each other form example, if I stack two of INDArray with 3 dim of 23 by 23 by 35, then the output should be 2 by 23 by 23 by 35. I try to use vstack but that is not what I want. raver119: :  I try to work around my code but it seems like if I use vstack I will always get the wrong dimension for data input because each of point of data input from dataAccess class will become 2 D which in fact need to be 3D when training. I got the following error. Do you have any suggestion?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: My code is similar with [<-LINK->] , but the model will be overwritten after each execution. 
solution: 

issue: Uhm, guys, the current master on DL4j is broken becauseMLLibUtil::fromContinuousLabeledPoint(JavaRDD<LabeledPoint> data)is defined twice 
solution: 

issue: So that means for a single batch of traing data, the net will be fit 10 times on that sequence of data? 
solution: PhavMakara_twitter: according to your own words, you don’t have 3D arrays, but 2D. i need closer look & going to try reproduce it. 

issue: usual problem for complex systems you can't imagine how often i get that feeling :) but usually that feeling is followed by 100500 incoming bug reports 
solution: well maybe you really are the only one then. and then i\'m spending week or two answering "thanks, bug is known, already fixed". 

issue: Hello. Trying to upgrade a project to dl4j 0.7 and getting this error: [com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper]: Factory method 'jacksonObjectMapper' threw exception; nested exception is java.util.ServiceConfigurationError: com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.Module: Provider org.nd4j.shade.jackson.module.jaxb.JaxbAnnotationModule not a subtypeadded nd4j-jackson to pom to no avail. it compiles when I add: <exclusion><groupId>org.nd4j</groupId><artifactId>jackson</artifactId></exclusion> but then fails at runtime. Any ideas? Thanks Worked fine with dl4j 0.5 
solution: 

issue: Hey, sorry for interrupting you, but I got a quick question, wondering if someone can answer it... If I run the following line of code on a pretty large Nd4j array (no dl4j involved) with tons of negative infinity values in it, a lot of messages saying "Number: -Infinity" get logged. Is this intentional, and if so, why?BooleanIndexing.applyWhere(array, new Or(Conditions.isInfinite(), Conditions.isNan()), 10);Does not happen with this piece of code:BooleanIndexing.applyWhere(array, new Or(Conditions.isInfinite(), Conditions.isNan()), new StableNumber(StableNumber.Type.DOUBLE));Nd4j 0.7.1 raver119: Assumed so. Thanks anyway, should I file a report or something? 
solution: 

issue: Hello everone. Need some help with LSTM model. After adding labelsMask, the training accuracy stopped growing, while I had 80% before. Are there any additional actions I should take, like changing Loss function? Thanks in advance The reason I use masks is that I need many to one RNN. DataSet trainingData = new DataSet(input,labels, null, labelsMask); labelsMask = [0,0,0,....,1] I have a sequence of 60 elements and one binary output in the end 
solution: if you are manually creating your input and labels, then yes - that's the way to do itif you didn't have label mask arrays before (but needed them), then the calculated accuracy would not have been valid. 

issue: where can I find the  nd4j.properties ?  thanks I'm executing a demo in the eclipse, but there's an error Caused by: java.io.FileNotFoundException: class path resource [nd4j.properties] cannot be opened because it does not existat org.springframework.core.io.ClassPathResource.getInputStream(ClassPathResource.java:157)at org.nd4j.linalg.factory.Nd4j.<clinit>(Nd4j.java:59)... 1 more I'm trying . wait a sec

issue: I try to train my NN for a really small dataset but I dont know why I got nan value after second iteration? Here the complete output  [<-LINK->] Do you guys have any suggestion for me to look for? :) 
solution: 

issue: I wish Java EE servers supported maven dependencies, so I can build smaller war files. Oh really? I wonder if doing that will let me have nd4j-native and nd4j-cuda-8.0 as provided. And just install the appropriate one based on the hardware running the server. 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] I'm wondering if we can just remove the jaxrs provider? I can't remember if/why we needed that I don't think that'll help here... still won't give the correct subtype i.e., it'll still extend nd4j jackson, not com.fasterxml.jackson 
solution: 

issue: Hello, How can I get the output from DeepAutoEncoderExample? The output vector of DeepAutoEncoderExample can not be seen [<-ISSUE->] agibsonccc: 
solution: arunwizz: not atm - you are welcome to open an issue though. 

issue: can't exclude when it's shaded unfortunately... the class files are physically modified and repackaged 
solution: So getting rid of the jaxrs stuff would be the best bet here. 

issue: I am currently doing all my training on digitalocean, but now that I am moving to a bigger dataset I would like to speedup things and am contemplating to moving to training on a GPU. Anyone know of a relatively cheap online service that they would recommend and have experience with (i.e. easily getting it set up)? 
solution: 

issue: tried using@ComponentScan(excludeFilters=@ComponentScan.Filter(type=FilterType.REGEX, pattern={"org.nd4j.shade.jackson.*"})) to no avail. will continue looking into it 
solution: 

issue: jvence: it'd be great to be able to reproduce this to test that solution thoughcould you open an issue with some details? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: ok sorry, don't know what is his timezone. I had a question regarding the implementation since it looks like that the fit() function is missing an important piece of the algorithm: the number of walks per vertex raver119: right, but did the fit() function changed as well? If so, it should be reviewed to make sure this bug is not there as well. 
solution: but this is really outside of the skipgram (an iteration loop that eventually leads to call skipgram()). 

issue: Has anyone looked into FPGA support? Amazon's recent announcement on fpga support is exciting agibsonccc: LOL, I spent a week last year trying to teach myself FPGA using LogiPi add on board for Raspberry pi loads of fun, but man it made my head hurt, spin, hurt, spin and then tumble in the dryer microsoft's AI project is FPGA based and they claim to get like 100x improvement in speed 
solution: back in 2002 I wanted to use FPGA to accelerate pattern matching by building a generalized framework that takes any query plan and compiles the predicate evaluation to FPGA to speed things up. 

issue: woolfel: if you're willing to send a pull request by my guest :D I'm not even entertaining that no one who buys from skymind even knows what an fpga is that would be pure hobbyist play it\'s "fun" not really practical 
solution: raver119: yes understood :). 

issue: Xilinx recently released C/C++ based tools for their stuff, so I was planning to study that over the holiday break

issue: i’ve started implementing special case param server for our spark nlp so that one shoulf be the part of 0.8.0 
solution: it’s not conventional ps, and won’t be used anywhere else, because of special requirements there. 

issue: For 2017, I'm thinking of building a new system specifically for playing with DL4J, anyone have recommendations for mid-range workstation that won't break the bank? that's outside my budget I'm thinking under 1200.00 total 
solution: I have an existing tower, so Core i7, 32GB ram, SSD, Nvidia card. 

issue: How do I calculate that dimensionality? The char lstm has a low input dimension, low batch size, not so big hidden size and a long time sequence The problems I working on have much higher input dimension, larger batch sizes, similar hidden sizes and shorter time sequences. 
solution: no idea, i’m working on byte levels, if you want i can tell you linear thresholds, but that poorely map into real world. 

issue: Hi all! I want to invite all data scientists to participate in my survey about the tools you use in work: [<-LINK->] I'll be grateful to everyone for sharing my survey among your friends in social networks ;)

issue: I changed the version to 0.7.0, and got error: The POM for org.deeplearning4j:deeplearning4j-ui:jar:0.7.0 is missing, no dependency information available 
solution: 

issue: change "7.5" to "8.0" in your pom file <nd4j.backend>nd4j-native-platform</nd4j.backend> -> <nd4j.backend>nd4j-cuda-8.0-platform</nd4j.backend>

issue: Hi @raver119, thanks for the blazing fast email reply. So I\'m facing an issue when running the latest ParagraphVectorsTextExample.INDArray inferredVectorA = vectors.inferVector("This is my world .");Produces what seems like a zero array. inferredVectorA from debugging in IntelliJ is:[0.00, 0.00, 0.00, -0.00, 0.00, -0.00, -0.00, 0.00, 0.00, -0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, -0.00, -0.00, -0.00, 0.00, -0.00, -0.00, 0.00, -0.00, -0.00, -0.00, -0.00, 0.00, 0.00, -0.00, 0.00, 0.00, -0.00, 0.00, 0.00, -0.00, -0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, -0.00, -0.00, -0.00, -0.00, -0.00, 0.00, 0.00, -0.00, 0.00, 0.00, -0.00, 0.00, -0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, -0.00, 0.00, -0.00, -0.00, -0.00, -0.00, -0.00, 0.00, -0.00, -0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, -0.00, -0.00, -0.00, 0.00, -0.00, 0.00, -0.00, -0.00, -0.00, -0.00, -0.00, 0.00, -0.00, -0.00, -0.00, -0.00, -0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, -0.00, -0.00, -0.00, 0.00, 0.00, -0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, -0.00, 0.00, -0.00, 0.00] Alright thanks, but the cosine similarity is all 1.0

issue: Can someone help me for the error about    org/nd4j/shade/jackson/core/type/TypeReferenceI just git the source and import maven project to my eclipse.But I can't solve this issue AlexDBlack: I just git the dl4j source from [<-LINK->] then I import it to my eclipse, the error appears AlexDBlack: I have no change for the code raver119: I also try the maven central. The error is same 
solution: 

issue: kuluofenghun: I have no idea what the problem is - but open an issue on github with your full pom file I'll take a look kuluofenghun: can you try with intellij then? could be a problem with eclipse itself we've seen problems with eclipse + maven in the past not that problem specifically thoguh 
solution: 

issue: So guys... does there happen to already be a Dockerized DL4j UI? Seems like the easiest way to get a stand alone version up so it can work with Spark 
solution: 

issue: I just tried creating one quickly, but Play crashes with an error 'No configuration setting found for key 'play.crypto.provider'' Something is going wrong config-wise, I'll have to look into that I thought all the required config was included in the ui project (since it works fine if I run the same code from the IDE) 
solution: 

issue: Has behavior of output() function changed since 0.6.0?I'm trying the following line and it works fine on 0.6.0 but reportsInput that is not a matrix; expected matrix (rank 2), got rank 3 array with shape [1, 2, 8]on 0.7.1 [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: If I have a binary mask vector (1d), can I efficiently extract a subset of another 1d vector based on the mask? I can only imagine it working in 1d yeah, 0/1 But that's replacement, that doesn't change the dimension of my vector does it? yeah I was hoping to produce a subset, so really a smaller version with certain elements included okay I'll just replace my masked values with a magic constant and filter it out later then Or just do the masking on the heap it's not so bad in this case 
solution: 

issue: mask is 0/1 right? 
solution: 

issue: I am using dl4j-spark_2.11 version 0.6.0 for Scala 2.11, which dl4j ui is compatible with my scala version? I checked maven repo but I don't seem to find it 
solution: 

issue: EdeMeijer: play + spark in the same JVM is a problem due to common (but different versions of) dependenciesI tried for some time to get it going with dependency management, but there's alotthere that needs to be managed...jackson, typesafe config, and at least one or two others that I can't remember right now  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] short of something drastic like classloader isolation, it's pretty difficult from what I've seen soudia: speaking of UI - re your question: I'd suggest using DL4J 0.7.1 and using the new UI as per [<-LINK->] crockpotveggies: nothing specifically on STL10 format or reading binary files like that. closest thing is probably MNIST on the input: preprocessor would work for that otherwise custom layer that just wraps the original layer 
solution: 

issue: nifty, in the meantime is there a way I could work around it?  [<-LINK->] that one ah so if I understand this correctly, I could just implement this temporarily using a custom layer? 
solution: 

issue: I'm still seeing this warning on latest master,@AlexDBlackI think you said this is something that's not supposed to be happening anymore? [<-CODE->] then gives a stack trace starting withat org.reflections.vfs.Vfs.fromURL(Vfs.java:109) Ithinkyou could do that with ComputationGraph I'll let the experts elaborate, but ComputationGraph was created for complex use cases like that, also other things like multiple inputs/outputs  [<-LINK->] and check the !examples 
solution: 

issue: Does dl4j support to combine two different and separate DNN  models (such as CNN and LSTM)  to do prediction task? crockpotveggies: Thanks a lot. Where can I find any document to describe this function ? 
solution: 

issue: /home/jason/.javacpp/cache/nd4j-cuda-7.5-0.7.1-linux-x86_64.jar/org/nd4j/nativeblas/linux-x86_64/libjnind4j.so: libcublas.so.7.5 can't open shared object,no such file any help? /home/jason/.javacpp/cache/nd4j-cuda-7.5-0.7.1-linux-x86_64.jar/org/nd4j/nativeblas/linux-x86_64/libjnind4j.so: libcublas.so.7.5 can't open shared object,no such file or directory.   any help?  btw: i use cuda 8.0 on my ubuntu box <dependency><groupId>org.nd4j</groupId><artifactId>nd4j-cuda-7.5-platform</artifactId><version>${nd4j.version}</version></dependency> [<-CODE->] in  my examples ,i found two dependencies 
solution: 

issue: leonardgithub: not sure I'm following... everything should be configurable - change the paths etc for WordVectorSerializer so it doesn't overwrite the model? or make a copy? they are identical, yes - the second configuration will automatically add a merge vertex (identical to the first configuration) 
solution: 

issue: This is a stupid question but I can't find normalize.revertLabels, used in the rnn regression example.  If I want to revert the normalization after prediction was generated, I need to revert an INDarray which is something the intellij proposed reverts do, they do datasets and datasetiterators.  So whats going wrong? *don't do toPreprocessor:Dataset or DataSetIterator, those are the revert input values accepted by intellij 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: I got the Deeplearning4j UI running but can't be find the option to visualise the learned kernels/filters of the ConvNet? 
solution: it might use some love, but right now there’s few more high-priority things in queue. 

issue: AlexDBlack: My Word2VecUptrainingExample question is actually how to train on multiple txt files, and these files have no common words. Can any one answer the question above? train on multiple txt files and output just one model raver119: @EdeMeijerOne file for a news. We crawl the news on the Internet, and analyze the words' distances. 
solution: Guys, little modelling question. I have a time series prediction model, and it works nicely. However, it will always make mistakes and I want to be able to find out how confident it is in a prediction. My current idea is to train a secondary model for predicting the magnitude of error the first model will make. Does this sound like a reasonable approach or am I missing an obvious simpler solution?. 

issue: arunwizz: you’re using cuda, i guess? 
solution: 

issue: arunwizz: you can’t even imagine how much time i’m spending on this issue so there’s literally 0 chances i’ll forget about it webstorms: yep. 
solution: 

issue: leonardgithub: no I personally have not written a full demo that is currently publicly availablehowever, I might clean up my distance calculation code and make that publicly available after I have tested it a bit more 
solution: 

issue: The prediction I get is in a strange format, this is after I revertlabels back to what they were.  The expected outcome is floats in the 0.01 range, I don't understand why it keeps ongiving me negative values and way off the mark numbers. [<-LINK->] wait, this is weird, could sells actually show up as negative? If the predicted data is buys and sells going rate.  if so, magic! 
solution: wenbostar: ComputationGraph and MultiLayerNetwork have very similar APIs...any time you see output in one, there should be an output method in the otheronly difference: ComputationGraph may have multiple inputs/output INDArrays, whereas MultiLayerNetwork just has 1. 

issue: daredemo: for early stopping? yeah, you can use multiple conditions... if any of them trigger, it will stopre: invalid scores: you can use this [<-LINK->] that'll terminate if it finds a NaN or infinite value for the score JosephCatrambone: right, no deconv layers yetyeah, im2col basically creates all the windows of size kH x kW, to multiply the weights by mikeb01: in principle: yes - the transforms can do any arbitrary sequence -> to any arbitrary sequencewhether we have something built-in that does exactly that is another question how would that injection of additional rows work in your case? i.e., what specifically are you trying to do? 
solution: 

issue: mbkennel: any reason you're trying to build from source? Just use maven central :D none of our docs tell you to do that It's usually hard to run the unit tests properly because of cuda, cpu etc there's a lot of configurations to test 
solution: though, if you are building (and not actually wanting to run tests) - just use -DskipTests. 

issue: chrisvnicholson: ,I am interested in the building Keras .Would you give more information about Keras? What shall I do and when begin to work? agibsonccc: , I've sent a email. 
solution: 

issue: well, in general: you can't just combine RNN and DenseLayers like that - one deals with time series, the other with standard (non-time series) datait's not clear to me what you are trying to achieve: do you want a 2d output array? or time series output?If you want 2d output, you'll need to reduce the time series to a 2d vector somehow (perhaps by taking the last time steps with LastTimeStepVertex) 
solution: 

issue: When I try to train my Neural Network, the outputs of Neural Network are always classify as two labels only and ignore the rest of the labels. Do you have any suggestion that I can force my Neural Network to consider about the other label as well. Moreover, the graph is model score vs iteration is never getting below 1.5 with f1_score at most 0.2. 
solution: 

issue: raver119: : I check on troubles shooting link and try to turn my hyper parameter as in the page recommended but it does not work. I even try to over fit my model with small data set to see whether I have enough parameter for classification but again, the lose function is not decrease, and f1_score is around 0.2. Is there suggestion what to look for here? agibsonccc: and@raver120: here the link: [<-LINK->] Thank you 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: : I tracking those statistic beside loss function is not decreasing., the layer parameters histogram and layer update histogram's biased is screw not even close to Gaussian form after like 100 iterations. So I check on the output label on my training data, the label is not equally distributed. It is like label 4 is about 30 percent and 5 is another 25 percent. Do you think it is the reason why my convolution neural net is ignored the rest. I also try to decrease my learning rate to 0.0001 , it start to guess other labels but the accuracy is really low even after around 100 iteration.

issue: is anyone using video cards with Nvidia GPU with DL4j GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 
solution: 

issue: Hey, i'm trying to use some opencv (javacv) methods, but it seems that they are crashing with nd4j (all of this on android).  Someone got that working? 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I am trying to train LSTM on GPU, save it to a file and then use it only with CPU, but when I read double from output INDarray I often get NaN. Is it possieble to train on GPU and generate on CPU? 
solution: it would be nice if you could file an !issue with some code that reproduces that behavior. 

issue: Hi, I have a DLL problem in executing the simple MultiGpuLenetMnistExample.: .. .javacpp\\cache\\nd4j-cuda-7.5-0.7.1-windows-x86_64.jar\\org\\nd4j\\nativeblas\\windows-x86_64\\jnind4j.dll: Can't find dependent libraries 
solution: 

issue: wasn't pointing out that I care, I'm just amused how much I'm not getting from that Apple purchase a while back :P okay so this explains a lot in "real-world", what kind of performance will I be looking at for im2col? 
solution: xeon or server i7 (apparently GCloud uses i7). xeon will be the same as i7, but you’ll be able to have x2-x10 more parallel models running (or higher parallelism within one model), just due to higher number of cores. 

issue: Where is "getLayer()" method defined in the code base?  In the class MultiLayerNetwork, the method "init()" calls a method "conf.getLayer()" but I can\'t find where that method is define.  IntelliJ told me that it was not able to resolve that symbol.  What did I do wrong? [<-CODE->] 
solution: A further question.  I could not make/build the dl4j code base using IntelliJ.  For example, I tried to make the deeplearning4j-nn module, and received the follow error message:. 

issue: int vectorSize=200;INDArray inputAsk = Nd4j.zeros(new int[] { 1, vectorSize});...inputAsk.putRow(0, vector); //[OK]inputAsk.put(new INDArrayIndex[]{NDArrayIndex.point(0), NDArrayIndex.all()}, vector); //[EXCEPTION] why do the second style will throw exception? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: actually, can I use a different backend, that's software based and not using native stuff? 
solution: 

issue: so@AlexDBlackI passed the custom time server to both the driverandexecutors (usingspark.driver.extraJavaOptionsandspark.executor.extraJavaOptionsrespectively) and that seems to have done the trick. It is still puzzling though because in the main method of my training process I set the time server as a system property like soSystem.setProperty("org.deeplearning4j.spark.time.NTPTimeSource.server", "<my server>");. I thought that this method call would be picked up by both driver and executors but apparently not 
solution: 

issue: Guys, Is there any example OF RNN that uses data generated by Word2Vec for training? 
solution: 

issue: daanvdn: yeah, if it's set in the driver, it won't be carried over to the executors unfortunatelybtw, mind posting the command you used to configure the NTP server? I wouldn't mind getting that documented (I've never tried - never needed to) reflection is once per jvm 
solution: napgab: you can just turn the logging off with slf4j/log4j. a lot of it has to do with custom layers and loss functions. 

issue: AlexDBlack: you mean setting up the actual NTP server? If so, I'm afraid I can't help you: this was sth configured before my time by corporate IT 
solution: 

issue: Hi. I have a 3d matrix and I would like to read it from a file in csv format as a flat. Then i am feeding a convolutional neural network by using convolutionalFlat input type. But i am having an error about the input format. First of all is it possible? 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys, Spark training is acting very strange for me on current master. I'm going to try with an earlier revision of Dl4j to see if that changes anything. Epochs finish really fast,  I'm only seeing ' Starting training of split 1 of 5' (not 2, 3, 4, or 5 of 5), and scores don't change. Maybe some recent changes? Okay maybe it's a problem with my code, same behavior with version of last friday It's probably me :) I just thought that I didn't change anything related since friday, but I'll figure out what's up Yup, it's definitely me. I tried an older version of my own code and now it works. Sorry for that. Uh, okay, it was caused by adding a StatsListener for the UI to the SparkComputationGraph Without that, it works fine Yeah, it does, doesn't it I'll see if I can find out what's going on there I've got a feeling this is not really Nd4j related But really, StatsListener couldn't possibly have side effects on it's input, could it? With Spark + ComputationGraph 
solution: 

issue: I'm not seeing anything odd in the unit tests (run earlier today), or in our pre-release testing for 0.7.1 tuning [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] normalization and learning rate are the first 2 things to check 
solution: that sounds... odd. other than exceptions etc (which should show up in logs) I can't think of any reason it'd impact training. 

issue: Hi it's again me :) After a quick run a got the result:Examples labeled as 0 classified by model as 0: 61 timesExamples labeled as 0 classified by model as 1: 358 timesExamples labeled as 1 classified by model as 0: 25 timesExamples labeled as 1 classified by model as 1: 556 times it seems that the model labels everything as 1. What can be the main reason for that? 
solution: 

issue: hello everyone, I'm trying to plot my word2vec model trained with Europarl dataset. I have few issues regarding the input parameters for.lookupTable().plotVocab(tsne,numWords,server.getConnectionInfo()).What's numWords acctually means and how should I set it?\nI have tried 10, 100 , 1000. for 10 I get nothing, for 100 I get something but the dots are very sparce, and for 1000 it gets too slow (~1hour and still going). is it normal that it take a long time to plot?Thank you Thanks for the answer, yeah I just checked the amount of ram that is being used and I noticed that my heap was capped at 4Gs 
solution: 

issue: saudet: yes, I believe somebody was running 0.6.0 along with my 0.7.1 on the same server 
solution: 

issue: alright thanks, when you say paravec you mean a ParagraphVectors model builder, right?So the options required for inference (below) are not needed if I load the model directly using .useExistingModel():.sequenceLearningAlgorithm(new DM<VocabWord>()).trainWordVectors(true) 
solution: 

issue: not sure i understand 100%, if ParagraphVectors isn't fit and using only an existing word2vec model, then it won't be able to infer on a new (unknown) sentence right away, am I missing something? 
solution: it’s minor extension over w2v. so, in case of dm algorithm, your word to be predicted - is label, which is unknown initially, and initialized with random. 

issue: Well actually not that good : Tests run: 480, Failures: 0, Errors: 1, Skipped: 9The error is located in DataSetIteratorTest : org.nd4j.linalg.exception.ND4JIllegalStateException: Op target dimension [0, 2, 3] contains element that higher then rank of op.X: [3](full test stack : http://pastebin.com/FzhdFMu4)Though the other 480 unit tests passed, I suspect that this one is not related to my box but rather one of the tests not passing on master (maybe an issue to create if you confirm) OK that's no problem, I am aware that this is happens in practice and I just wanted to check that this was not correlated with my setup so that I'm safe diving in dl4j code and make modifications :) 
solution: cgravier: no, that has nothing to do with your setup. We were hunting bug in Autoencoder, and ended up with dimensionality check for ops.. 

issue: Is anyone aware of or know of a java image utility that can use a photo with green screen, and composite some other background? I was talking to a friend about "how to make it easier to create larger datasets" and it seems like using green screen + compositing "might" work I have no clue if it would actually work, just thinking aloud it would save me and everyone else time from taking 100K+ photos just to train a system 
solution: 

issue: a note about nd4j-native, I usually put a flag for the specific platform binary I need in my project definition, i.e. in Gradle it looks likend4jOS: [<-CODE->] 
solution: Aww.  Just natives makes for a tiny build, but alas, no requirements.. and looks like for my case,miniBatchis just1. 

issue: It's official now: [<-LINK->] I'm feeling a lot of pressure by being one of the last talks of the day. 
solution: Huh I can make it this year?. But it's currently full.. If Skymind sponsors I think you can get a couple of passes.. 

issue: somebody can tell me how to set DataSetIterator or ImageRecordReader for multiple file split thanks !!!!! i'm initialize imagerecordreader for many time for each Filesplit but not ok :D

issue: agibsonccc: nice  you guys are writing a book, that's a lot of work 
solution: 

issue: there are some questions about Evaluate. Examples labeled as 0 classified by model as 0: 99067 timesExamples labeled as 0 classified by model as 1: 3007 timesExamples labeled as 1 classified by model as 0: 5 timesExamples labeled as 1 classified by model as 1: 4745 times Accuracy:  0.9718Precision: 0.806Recall:    0.9847F1 Score:  0.8865 why the label 1 's precision is 0.6121001031991744, and recall is 0.9989473684210526 the label 1's TP is 4745, and FP is 5, the precision should be TP/(TP+FP), that is 0.9989473684210526? It seems that precision  and recall are exchanged. 
solution: 

issue: By the way, I Dockerized the UI in standalone server mode for Spark training etc, in case anyone's interested. [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: I don't understand your means, I see the precision is TP/(TP+FP) from sources ,so why the value is incorrect? 
solution: that is the complete output,I use "System.out.println("precision_1:" + eval.precision(1)); System.out.println("recall_1:" + eval.recall(1));" to output label 1 \'s precision and recall, but the value isn\'t match my own calculations. 

issue: if positive is 1, isn't positive examples labeled 1? ok I find my fault, tkx 
solution: as i see adam already filed an ux issue, so i guess we'll provide additional info, better explaining what is what in eval output. 

issue: so you're trying to run standalone paravec model within spark executor, right? lacic: please do, there should be the key for that problem i definitely need to see your source code. there's too much places to fck up there with spark and shared states so yea, file an !issue please 
solution: i mean - it definitelySHOULDwork, but there's also more then enough possible reasons why it doesn't for you. So, it should be checked and fixed, if anything is wrong there. 

issue: MaxTimeIterationTerminationCondition is the total time training has been running, right? for a moment I was thinking maybe it would be cool to have a variant to MaxTimeIterationTerminationCondition where there is a limit in time since the last update... but then again, now I'm not totally sure it that would be useful 
solution: The -Xmx flag is also set to 4G in the screen shot's example (monitor ss), but the error happens before the 4g limit is reached. 

issue: Where is the documentation on Data Setup? I want to test a cnn on unlabeled images This is very close to what I need: [<-LINK->] I've trained a NN, now I want to test it on unlabeled images List<String> predict = network.predict(BufferedImage) That function doesn't take a buffered image, but thats what I need to do

issue: when using EarlyStopping... one epoch is defined as what? one mini-batch? or one full training set? 
solution: and it takes everything you have. 

issue: I made an app with dl4j and I want to deploy it on weblogic which is installed on a linux machine it complains about java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no jnind4j in java.library.path I use a previous version of dl4j 3.9 I guess there is a problem with dlls for linux you have right guys..but I need to change a lot in code 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] with this great deps..my work is fine locally 
solution: 

issue: somehow I get very different results when using EarlyStopping... is it because I was overfitting before? 
solution: 

issue: I changed time zones 
solution: 

issue: Building a ParagraphVectors with .useExistingWordVectors, and I'm setting the tokenizer, but when I call inferVectors the values in the vector are always zero. What am I missing? 
solution: as for 2) i’ll get that fixed tomorrow.

solution: 

issue: hi, I add listener to get the score after each iteration like this: sparkNetwork.setListeners(Collections.<IterationListener>singletonList(new ScoreIterationListener(1))); It works in 0.6.0 like this: 16/12/13 14:20:26 INFO listeners.ScoreIterationListener: Score at iteration 0 is 0.22594124344794478. But when I change to 0.7.1, I cannot get the info any more. BTW, I run the demo in Spark cluster Any help? 
solution: 

issue: ChaoyingWu: i can't get what's your problem. could you please explain what's your actual problem? 
solution: 

issue: when using convolution, is there some preferred activation function? or like always it is left to the voodoo :D 
solution: 

issue: Is there any way I can monitor the progress of word2vec/doc2vec via logging? (UI is not an option, tried it but I am running inside a Play-dependent app using a different version). I am running doc2vec using existing word vectors, roughly 10mb on disk, on a dataset with not too much data in it (roughly 5mb on disk) all on my GPU (geforce mx980m). Tried with a bunch of epochs/iterations but it feels to take forever, I can't really see where it is at, so could I see what iteration/epoch/batch it is currently at?

issue: Hi again... I\'m trying to implement a version of early stopping where I test the model on some development data every so many iterations. If the error is still going down I write the model to disk and keep going otherwise I stop the training. However, I get a  "java.io.NotSerializableException: sun.management.GarbageCollectorImpl" if I have the StatsListener attached to the network. 
solution: 

issue: When we call toString on a NDArrayWritable what is every one's thoughts on removing the starting [ and ending ]? That makes sense. I decided that if I have the need to do that I'll write something that wraps the NDArrayWritable that will remove those in the toString process. 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: Thanks! Another question -- I have a huge file to load my datasets from. What I do is I read the file line by line and save INDArray element for each example. This means that I need to have a huge space to store the dataset object. Can't it be that I just read one example, use it for learning and forget about it? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: np, where can I file an issue and back to the original question. I want to train using dl4j on imagennet and then on my own database np, posted. but still any direction for how to use dl4j with the full imagnet db 
solution: You can contribute some stuff if you want - otherwise just wait for the model import.

issue: When using stochastic gradient, are the data sets shuffled before training? 
solution: bikashg: right yeah there's no reason in doing that for a toy problem. 

issue: Also I think I read there are some json changes in the new version my old models saved with getLayerWiseConfigurations().toJson() failed now to load, is it documented the changes to fix the old jsons? Thanks!

solution: someonedeep: TBH, I don't fully get it. However, [<-LINK->] might help you to understand the structure. 

issue: I also detect another change in 0.7.1 maybe earlier in the return layer names of the function model.paramTable(); previous version names where : 0_W,0_b,0_bB,1_W....  and now they are 0_W,0_b,0_vb....     >  The bB  is now vb maybe is that why loading  older json model files fail since the json uses  "bB" : 0.0, .... AlexDBlack: at least 0.4-rc3.10 with that my json model files were created 
solution: 

issue: Ok no problem, so matching layers with the fattening will be tricky to recover the old models? 
solution: 

issue: Is it possible to create custom vertexes? (I know custom layers work) I wonder if what I want is a custom layer or custom vertex... 
solution: Instead of just LastTimeStepVertex I want to see if I can make a LastNSentencesVertex.. 

issue: bikashg: yep, definitely. you also should realise - consineSimilarity widely used for w2v is NOT real distance function by definition 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I want to train word2vec model based on depency parse instead of raw word sequence (paper: [<-LINK->] ). So instead of fixed window size, there would be N context words for each target word (Figure 1). Can you point me to classes/methods where I need to make changes for this approach? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: this should fix it [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: cool, I like the approach. simple and keep backward compatibility :) thanks I'll run tests then merge 
solution: as for your base rate: 3149/3393 = 0.928 -> your local network is likely just predicting the most frequent class (or, very close to). 

issue: or I could scale up all my values by multiplying by 1000 before training and normalisation? 
solution: but if I only care about whats on the left hand side of the decimal place then the floats wont matter. 

issue: So this is obviously quite a common issue in network training? 
solution: 

issue: Hi,does anyone know what could be the cause of this error? [<-CODE->]

issue: magx2: Are you using the LSTM model? 
solution: Yeah I would defer to Alex on this. I recommend posting a gist of your code and share anything around your dataset. 

issue: kuluofenghun: didn't we tell you to file an issue? If you don't hear back from us after posting it's not that we're not aware - it's that dave is busy at the moment I remember posting it yesterday - I'm aware you're excited but dave has some time off right now, we will work on it when we can We have some other engineers ramping up on this as well

issue: Hello , is Spark2 supported or I have to install spark 1.6 ? 
solution: 

issue: I\'m reading about the rnn stuff and it says "It is not possible to change the number of examples between calls of rnnTimeStep" I'm trying to understand this: to make a prediction, I need the previous state, but if I call rnnClearPreviousState(), this clears the previous... which now allows me to use any number of examples I want... but because previous state was cleared... this means that I'm back in the beginning? let's say I have daily data, and I do at first 2 examples (days) at a time... after some time I've reached say Thursday and could predict Friday, but if I do rnnClearPreviousState(), then I'm back to Monday? AlexDBlack: I'm not yet even trying to optimize, I'm not sure what it is doing or supposed to be doing... for example, if I do single step, then I get next day, right? if I do say 2 examples/days, then I predict the day after tomorrow? or still just tomorrow? that's exactly what I'm reading (not yet the javadoc though) so 3 examples would mean tomorrows prediction in 3 locations? 
solution: 

issue: Hello all I am new to the group. I read the documentation but I do not see mentions to the version of spark supported. Not sure how to ask, is a question like "is Spark 2.0" supported acceptable? :)

solution: 

issue: little question My multi data set has 2 inputs, 1 is a time series input, the other is 2d. The 2d data is basically some static data that doesn't change over time. I would like it to be 'copied' every time step before merging it with the 3d data, if you know what I mean. I think@AlexDBlackonce pointed me to some kind of repeating pre processor or something but I can't find it So my data isnotof dimension [batch_size * time_steps, features], like you would need for the FeedForwardToRnnPreProcessor, but it's just [batch_size, features] and I would like a processor to repeat it for every time step in the other input 
solution: yeahhh.

solution: 

issue: Hi all! when I train a conv NN in dl4j, the network always produces the same result regardless of input. I tried going through the troubleshooting page: changed the weight init methods, played with activation functions and with the learning rate - nothing helps. Even if I remove all the regularization, it can't overfit. When I look at the change of weight between iterations [sum over (W_old - W_new) ** 2], it's quite small - 1E-5 and lower.For the network I try lenet or alexnet - both have the same issues.I also scale the input before training the net.any ideas what could be the problem? 
solution: 

issue: haven't seen it in a while, but it is back. Anyone can explain a saw pattern in the score vs iteration graph?  [<-LINK->]

issue: Is output() on ComputationGraphs or MultiplayerNetworks completely threadsafe even on GPUs? ah setInputs() probably isnt going to work with a bunch of threads That's what I thought.  Thought I could do it in JBOSS with a Singleton EJB.  Turning out to be a pain though. Thinking of just using model.clone().output(). That would be awesome, make things much easier. 
solution: 

issue: Hi everybody. I have a question on the UIServer. How do I visualize the progress of the Word2Vec algorithm? Or is this not yet supported (I'm using version 0.7.1) Specifically, there is nosetListenersmethod. 
solution: 

issue: so just copying pom.xml from your DeeplLearning4jExamples to my new project is enough? 
solution: All you really nyeed is deeplearning4j-core and a backend (say: nd4j-native-platform). From there it depends on what functionality you want. 

issue: Hi, when I call testIterator.next().getFeatures() or testIterator.next().getFeatureMatrix() the INDArray returned only returns 1 column from my features file, when in actual fact my features file contains 5 columns of data.

issue: agibsonccc: i'm a little confused about the seq2seq example(AdditionRNN), is there any introduction about this one? 
solution: i know the perpose. but i can not understand the principle behind it. The decoder takes the last output in the time series from the encoder and generates an equivalent length sequence. 

issue: raver119: how do you send image to ui server's sub url? I immitate your convolution layer listener but failed. I saw you set path, but you only print it to console and never use it again. raver119: I know, but you didn't pass .../activations to StatsStorage, how do you bind your image to that url? I have filed an issue, would you please look it for me? Is that I cannot use ConvolutionListenerPersistable directly? 
solution: but create your own. 

issue: agibsonccc: hi~~ i have read AdditionRNN.java#L75, and why does the net have two inputs? in my opinion, the net Architecture is a encoder followed by a decoder. there is only one input that is the string like "12+13", why does the net use decoderSeq as another input? does the decoderSeq input  connect to the encoder directly?

issue: i have still problem with understanding the batchsize. Let me explain, if i have 100 rows in train set and if i set batch size=100  means what? or setting batchsize=1 whta are the differences? i really still dont understand. 
solution: Go through this chapter and come back. 

issue: ZhongBaby: mind !gist ing a full stack trace? This looks abnormal: Error putting member offsets for class org/bytedeco/javacpp/avutil$Pool_free_Pointer. What OS are you on? 
solution: When you're getting a completely random error there's not much I can do to help you there. 

issue: I had failed to run the example of cuda specific in Windows 10, even other examples are OK. But it's a few days ago, I'm trying to get the latest version and test now... Yep, it works fine now. Thank you@agibsonccc

issue: one more question is there any examples related to the CIFAR -10 or 100 datasets with CNN? 
solution: yes i think i should learn the pattern first and then try to implement it because my original project is actually similar to the cifar except i would like to classify pistachio according to the quality standards.

issue: Say I have a string"[[0.00, 0.00, 0.00],[0.00, 0.00, 0.00],[0.00, 0.00, 0.00]]"Then is there a way to convert that to a INDArray? 
solution: 

issue: Hey@agibsoncccfor my GSON module I\'m only going to include a method to deserialize the raw string aka deserialize"[[0.00, 0.00, 0.00],[0.00, 0.00, 0.00],[0.00, 0.00, 0.00]]"Are you ok with that? Or do you want more or something else

solution: 

issue: can anyone help me why am i getting the same prediction result on every images  even-though i clean the image input matrix every-time when the program ends. 
solution: anandkoirala: !tuning. 

issue: So when are we going to build a smart bot that uses every occurence of someone asking a question and someone replying with ! tuning? 
solution: work first - fun second. 

issue: Yes, I saw. I guess I was hoping for something more intuitive. I'll dig around in the DataSet class to see if I can rewire it for my dataset. Do I need to manually open my input file and the corrected output file, convert them both to INDArrays and feed them into the DataSet constructor and then fit the model to that?That's what it looks like from my angle, but I want to make sure that sounds correct. 
solution: 

issue: if the following question makes you laugh, it should.... I was playing around with the GravesLSTM example and attempting to generate the characters 1 to 49 
solution: By the very nature of the math it needs to be static. but the neural net was producing stuff that looks likeY12,742. 

issue: agibsonccc: in RNN landSequenceRecordReaderDataSetIteratorassume  that the label is the sequence number? i.e. timeseries[0] = label of 0? 
solution: 

issue: Ok, well.Hadoop is slower that Spark, that's is a fact.But, may you give send the file (deeplearning4j in MapReduce) ?Actually, i am trying to finish my final project in college.In my final project, i want to analysis computation performance between Hadoop and Spark to predict weather using Storm Event Database from NCDC.And after that, i stuck because there are none algorithm library that support Hadoop's MapReduce. But, there are a lot for Spark.I dont know why, but maybe processing speed makes Spark better thatn Hadoop

issue: is anyone aware of any word embeddings trained on all of wikipedia? if not, I'll give the wiki corpus a shot on DL4J I need it anyways for some stuff 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I was hoping someone could help me transition from the youtube Deeplearning4j - Skymind lecture 0 to lecture 1.  That is, going from running the examples to starting a new project. I would greatly appreciate it. 
solution: emmanueltsukerman: Next you'd want to look at the !examples. 

issue: RNN question: I noticed that during training the net score never really goes below 13 and plateaus at that value....however if I continue training then the generated results empirically improve in quality... is that observer bias, where Ithinkit's improving but it actually isn't? or is the RNN learning something not reflected in iteration score? (note I'm doing the equivalent of character generation) 
solution: 

issue: If I were a gambling man I would be betting on overfitting. 
solution: 

issue: So there's diverging here (score going up) vs overfitting where depending on the minibatch score could go down based on labels? :D Or at least where it tends to learn 1 class I'd maybe consider stronger regularization either way, fix is the same If the steps are stable and it still doesn't learn anything, you'd be unerfitting then 
solution: 

issue: why does the ScoreListener of word2vec output "Average score for last batch: 0.0"?the score always is 0, is the ScoreListener  avaliable? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: can't I make it run on single GPU ? 
solution: From which I will probably tell you to go to !tuning. 

issue: I updated my Dockerized DL4j UI to 0.7.2 too ( [<-LINK->] )

issue: will try once I get some time, now doing the DM one, still 15% CPU load 
solution: well, anyway i’m heading off now. please check my comment in your new issue, i’ll pick it up @ morning. 

issue: crockpotveggies: paramTable has everything for the net so no other parameters... just be careful to align them properly in case you change the number of layers, layer names etc well, only other thing is the updater state, but I probably wouldn't bother copying that over 
solution: 

issue: might just not be enough iterations yet? try a refresh? The summary might just not have enough information yet that can happen Itissupposed to be an average :D 
solution: 

issue: Congrats on new Training UI/visualisation (I just upgraded from 0.6) - very cool.. 
solution: 

issue: What does this mean? No available [HOST] memory, sleeping for a while... 
solution: The gpu is out of host memory and it's waiting on garbage collection. 

issue: I\'m receiving the following error when trying to run a video data into the video LSTM example:org.deeplearning4j.datasets.datavec.SequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator@3e5501b7Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: org.jcodec.api.UnsupportedFormatException: Codec is not supportedat org.datavec.codec.reader.CodecRecordReader.loadData(CodecRecordReader.java:114)at org.datavec.codec.reader.CodecRecordReader.sequenceRecord(CodecRecordReader.java:89)at the Video's are formatted as mp4's, is there a certain type of preprocessing that needs to take place for the codecrecordreader? 
solution: 

issue: depends what you are looking for... it's a huge projectare you trying to implement a new type of neural network or something? back during development I ran it fine with a 1000 layer network (dense layers) if you can give me a configuration that reproduces the issue, I could take a look make sure you are on 0.7.2 first though 
solution: 

issue: what about com.google.guava, datavec-data-codec, jfreechart, jcommon, httpclient <== these I take it will use different versions to 0.7.2? 
solution: 

issue: "everything in the ecosystem (dl4j/nd4j/datavec) has the exact same versioning scheme."Was thinking about that.If that is the case, then why do we need 4 "0.7.2" version numbers in the pom.xml for the examples?\'\'\' <nd4j.version>0.7.2</nd4j.version><dl4j.version>0.7.2</dl4j.version><datavec.version>0.7.2</datavec.version><arbiter.version>0.7.2</arbiter.version> 
solution: verbose but maybe clearer IMO, saves confusion vs. having an <all.the.things.version> tag :)could argue it's better the other way though. 

issue: ah ok undersood that , so the fileplit is not empty in my case but when calling dataIter.hasnext() i get : Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Indeterminant state: record must not be null, or a file iterator must exist, cant get behind that. is my record reader empty ? but i initialized it with my training date 
solution: 

issue: it already throws on the fist has.next call cant say if there would be rucusive calls, when viewing the inputsplit (trainData) that is used to initialize the record reader, i only get a URI but the Filesplit is not empty. Maybe i did a mistake on initializing the record reader ? yep+ 
solution: 

issue: just pull 0.7.2 examples from repo? there’s new examples were added for new functionality pull latest libnd4j/nd4j that was fixed ages ago huitseeker: ^^^ it’s definitely impossible to get that error on latest libnd4j/nd4j what about libnd4j? 
solution: 

issue: I am a  big noob probalby, but I don't understand the installation proces on the website, i looked at both the quick start and the comprehensive setup guide, as well as another website. But whenever I do those things, I do get examples, but I can't import any classes to run it for myself. I am using eclipse BTW 
solution: 

issue: huitseeker: are you using the build script? 
solution: unless you mean dbuild, no. 

issue: i get error like this Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Unknown or not supported loss function: RMSE_XENT what should i do? 
solution: and i get the error like Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Unknown or not supported loss function: RMSE_XENT. 

issue: gks141270: fyi: [<-ISSUE->] I was messing around with tuning too, so I want to do some more testing before merging that RanaMalhas: in terms of generating outputs, there's no difference between the standard and bidirectional LSTMof course, you can't use a bi-directional LSTM one time step at a time (always need the full time series) you can't get the activations out of the forward and backward LSTMs separately - they are added internally in the layer. not sure why you'd want to, anyway as for mean pooling across time - that's something we're looking at adding in the near future 
solution: 

issue: Hi there, just looking at doc2vec (actually coming back to it after over a year).  I'm still confused by why doc2vec seems to assume that you're converting a doc to a vector, and then using that to classify the document - but why make this assumption?  What if you want to use the vector for something else? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I'm also having some problem running the examples. Here's the error: [<-LINK->] I installed java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel.x86_64 with yum, and I can see the version information when I run java -version.

issue: I'm trying to train my model using a GPU and Cuda using aws but I get the following [<-LINK->] I set up the smallest P2 instance with Bitfusion Boost Ubuntu 14 Cuda 7 
solution: and provide as much details as possible please. 

issue: I assume you are getting an error? can you post that error in a !gist ? 
solution: 

issue: the configuration code shouldn't make any differenceagain, can you open an issue (with those details) so we can look into it? thanks 
solution: 

issue: There is nothing to set o_0 If you are having problems it is likely related to being new to m2eclipse 
solution: 

issue: If calling CudaEnvironment.getInstance() flags exceptions does that mean I can't train using the GPU as this indicates there is some issue with nd4j? dd1121: I've got the same issue as you 
solution: 

issue: think i found a bug in quick start.MultiLayerConfiguration conf = new NeuralNetConfiguration.Builder() NeuralNetConfigurationdoes not contains member.backpropused later and if i change it toMultiLayerConfigurationthen member.iterationsis not there so, what would be the correct code of  part >A Taste of Code? also here is my java file : [<-LINK->] thanks i'll give it a shot :) 
solution: 

issue: skywalkerytx: Maybe you should do the Prerequisites ( [<-LINK->] ) first, then do the "DL4J Examples in a Few Easy Steps" later on the page. The code sniplet you mention is not an example. It is an example of what could looks like. 
solution: 

issue: Hi everyone, I have a [O x K x W x H] output from a conv layer, and I woul like to apply SoftMax() transform along the second dimension (the one of size K) i can't find a way to make the SoftMax() transform work without flattening everything in a single 1xM INDArray this is what I wanted to ask...where can i find documentation on how to setup the SoftMax transform() ? I have tried looking at the code, but it 's not straightforward (at least not for me)..thx 
solution: I also already told you reshape doesn't really cost anything. 

issue: last question, is there any way I can setup the SoftMax behaviour ? I need it to work on the "slice" everytime I want to get the output from my fully convolutional network 
solution: because I am trying to implement a fully conv net. I have started from AlexNet, and I have transformed the last 3 FC layers (including the output layer) into conv layers, and I loaded the weights from a previously trained AlexNet. 

issue: another option if you want the most control over the exact iteration order for both the CSV and image reader - you can always just wrap the CSV reader and image reader in your own custom RecordReader, concatenate the outputs, pass to the RecordReaderMultiDataSetIterator 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] this is why mmuli is slow, the code is at line 2825, BaseNDArray.java 
solution: 

issue: Hi everyone, I wanted to ask if there are any pretrained model for the alexnet implementation, I googled a lot but I can't find anything 
solution: you are welcome to attempt to use our keras model import and mess around with that if youw ant. 

issue: Hi, I have a question regarding the training UI. What do the keys mean in the graphs? They take values like 0_W, 1_W, 0_RW 
solution: I don't know what you expect to happen, you're going to get different results for different orders. 

issue: raver120: does thee book contain a lot of information not on the site? 
solution: "I have read it and didn\'t follow the steps but chose to ask a question because I\'m impatient" :D. 

issue: hi guys! what means if after some iteration my score is NaN? 
solution: yeah, i have already read it and used also... i have only added some hidden nodes to my existing layer and now after 300 iterations my score gets NaN and also the UIServer doesn't work, it display only blank charts. 

issue: Since the talk is currently about NaNs, I had an issue after switching from 0.7.1 to 0.7.2. I have a network trained with 0.7.1, and after switching to 0.7.2 and loading the trained model I get NaN in every iteration. It doesn't happen when I revert to 0.7.1. I didn't try to train the net from the scratch with 0.7.2... I will. Sure. 
solution: 

issue: rmuchev: what browser you're using? interesting can you please check your network log in browser to see if there's failed downloads it sounds like some scripts were failed to load 
solution: out of our control atm. I can switch to diggerent network (4g) and try. 

issue: I think the problem is that it tries to fetch the resources (css  and js) from assets folder  [<-LINK->] this does not really exists it should try to fetch them from CDN Yep, if you check deeplearning4j-ui-resources-0.7.2.jar you will see that it is totally unalingned with the examples... raver119: it wont work on your machine either 
solution: 

issue: Hi@rmuchev, just run the example and tried with Chrome and FF...both seem to work for me. Graphs are shown and the browser console is empty I just pulled the example repository of DL4J via github and imported it in Eclipse as a Maven project. Worked fine for me. 
solution: 

issue: what actually let me think about an update is a note here: [<-LINK->] in the Loss Function section: "For pretraining, choose reconstruction entropy. For classification, use multiclass cross entropy." The "RECONSTRUCTION_CROSSENTROPY" is available for me, but anything explicitly similar to "multiclass cross entropy" is not  in the list -- but as i see, it\'s not even in documentation; what is meant y the last loss function? 
solution: 

issue: Please can someone help with the missing browser resources?  [<-LINK->] I am really stuck here I am online i cleared browser cache and cookes and tried different browser all have same result i am using win 10 i receive 200 OK 
solution: 

issue: Do NativeImageLoader and ImageRecordReader work together? Like if i use ImageRecordReader to train and NativeImageLoader to get the output from the trained network 
solution: 

issue: it's worth noting that you don'thaveto use w2v to represent your words, but it's pretty common and works wellfor example, some machine translation work uses one-hot vectors to represent the words instead, but that is (a) costly to compute, and (b) results in a limited vocab, in the range of 10k's of words (whereas w2v-based approaches can scale to millions of words without issue) 
solution: 

issue: Hi I am getting this error when trying to do mvn install. any idea:Could not find artifact org.deeplearning4j:dl4j-test-resources:jar:0.7.3-SNAPSHOT in sonatype-nexus-snapshots ( [<-LINK->] ) yeah I am trying to use latest change, so I'd like to build with latest version@AlexDBlack have you seen this issue before? do I need to build the test-resources first and publish it to maven? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I think my question is similiar to@frederik-vaassen: If Ive a document with several sentences and want to classify some paragraphs (or just a sequence) with a label, how could that be done? One solution I came up with is to splitt the document and into sentences and use ParagraphVectors, but Im looking for something more 'flexible' 
solution: 

issue: Is there someone knows the problem about "java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no jniopenblas in java.library.path"?  dl4j version: 0.7.2, platform: windows 10-64bit. Thanks.

issue: hi i m beginner in DL4J for deeplearning for j Deeplearning4j in quick start par $ git clone [<-LINK->] $ cd dl4j-examples/$ mvn clean install these codes are for linux but im working on win10 
solution: i can clone it. but dependencies dosent work. 

issue: raver119: I just tried to change "<artifactId>nd4j-native</artifactId>" to "<artifactId>nd4j-native-platform</artifactId>", but it doesn\'t work. It\'s also that error. can\'t find jniopenblas.dll java version "1.8.0_111"Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_111-b14)Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.111-b14, mixed mode)  [<-LINK->]

issue: Give us a !gist of the full stack trace then yeah we'll need your full error ahh add javacv as a dependency  [<-CODE->] 
solution: I was looking at opencv :D. 

issue: pretty same for me, for pre-release testing i did tests on windows 10 as well, and i don’t have mkl or openblas  installed, everything works out of box markWZX: by any chance, do you have anakonda installed? or any math software? 
solution: He was wondering if you have clashing versions of the native math code we run. 

issue: Hello Everyone, I am trying a very basic classification example with my own csv dataset on the classification example mentioned here: [<-LINK->] My data set has 194 independent variables instead of 2, but the final output is same binary variable either 0 or 1.I have changed the numInputs= 190 and kept numOutputs=2 alogn with changes inDataSetIterator trainIter = new RecordReaderDataSetIterator(rr,batchSize,0,190);But, I am getting this error:"Labels array numColumns (size(1) = 194) does not match output layer number of outputs (nOut = 2)" Any advice ? 
solution: 

issue: Hi all :) Jut to say that i fixed the problem with the missing assets. This can help someone in the future. The fix is to add dl4j-examples-0.7-SNAPSHOT-bin.jar on buildpath One question: DataSetIterator trainIter = new RecordReaderDataSetIterator(rr,batchSize,0,2); what batchSize value means?

issue: I'm trying to create a model that takes a time series of lab data and predict if they have a condition. I have the model created, but I have no idea how to get the end prediction.  I'm trying this: [<-CODE->] and it outputs this:The Label:-0.17960192263126373The Prediction:NaNAny idea how to get the label and prediction? the labels are all 1 or 0, so it's a classification problem 
solution: 

issue: we have supported cuda 8 for a while now, so just use that and you should be fine 
solution: 

issue: raver119: thanks a lot for your patience and inputs. It worked out. The problem was that  I had JDK 7 when my target was 1.8. I uninstalled all Java, cleaned out path variables and reinstalled Java 8. That solved the problem. 
solution: 

issue: Hello. Is there a BLSTM implementation in deeplearning4j? Okay, this follows the same  in Graves' Thesis? I also require CTC, is that implemented too? 
solution: And yes, does this library integrate well with Android?. 

issue: depends on how hard I make the problem. It\'s like topic classification, but I can classify on multiple levels in the topic hierarchy. "finance" vs "IT" should be easy, but on the level of "java development" vs "c++ development" you will have way more classes and a lot more vocabulary overlap I'm just exploring, so I'll give paravec a go anyway ;)

issue: hi. Completed all installations. Trying to import examples project in IntelliJ. I chose to import from Maven. Then prompted to select SDK. Chose JDK. It defaulted to a folder under intelliJ, but when I clicked ok, I got an Invalid Path error. Should I choose my Java 1.8 Folder instead? So should I choose C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_112 
solution: 

issue: If I use the cuda backend and don't add native to Gradle/JAR, do I need to worry about doing checks to see if CUDA is available in my app? Or does the CUDA backend still include natives? 
solution: 

issue: I have a time series classification model. Is there any way to get the class probabilities for each example?  For example, just [0.75,0.25] for each case. I'm using .output() currently and it's giving me numbers for every time step and they (oddly enough) never add up to 1 I've also tried using predict(), but I get this error:java.lang.IllegalStateException: Label names are not defined on this dataset. Add label names in order to use getLabelName with an id. My dataset does have labels though 
solution: 

issue: stealthman13: well the second error is pretty self explanatory ;/ Label names on the dataset aren't set, so you can't use em :D Yeah your point? It says right there: label "names" 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Hi, on dl4j 0.7.2 with cuda 8.0 my score for a rather non-trivial RNN with regression is always NaN. When I change backend to CPU, it trains perfectly normal. Are there currently some known issues with 0.7.2 and cuda? Ye it is probably tuning, but I already read through your material :D 
solution: 

issue: question, what does nd4j doe with my data when HALF is set? 
solution: it doesn' tmatter. so basically I can pump 2x in gpu, no?. 

issue: probably rounds your gradients to 0 and makes things explode? 
solution: 

issue: Having trouble running word2vec on spark 2.0 I see that currently only 1.6 is supported , are there plans to upgrade? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: hi, my computer config is i3 cpu, and 8G ram. but when i runthis example of  Word2VecSentimentRNN, it keeps in this state for a long time. does that mean my computer config not enough? 
solution: i bet pc is swapping :). 

issue: there's is some state for rnns used with truncated BPTT but it's totally separate to rnnTimeStep non-overlapping fields/storage mechanisms now, output doesn't use either anyway rnnTimeStep will use whatever stored state is there, unless you reset it and you can't time step a bidirectional LSTM anyway i.e., you need the full sequence so, with output you are always getting a zero initialization for the state (same as during training) 
solution: The score at iteration 100 (or whatever iteration immediately after output) drops. 

issue: Hi,I\'ve just tried to upgrade from 0.7.1 -> 0.7.2 and after I successful "mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true -U" I get some exceptions in my unit tests.For example, calling: [<-CODE->] I get the following error: [<-CODE->] Any idea what\'s missing? Is there a new dependency to add in the pom.xml ? here you go: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Hey, I'm trying to use deeplearning4j for teaching the computer to win games (for example tic tac toe). Is there an example that uses a multilayerperceptron combined with some evolutionary algorithm to train? I'm guessing that is the way to go at least.. 
solution: 

issue: are you saying you need an UIServer for the statement tsne.plot(weights,2,cacheList,outputFile); to actually show a plot? so, its anything but obvious to me that a plot method would not plot, only write to a file so, please how to call real plot? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: Hi, one simple question: I trained RNN network with word vector labels (positive and negative numbers). However, I can only get the labels with the positive numbers. Is there something wrong with my training parameters? nyghtowl: @raver119 [<-LINK->] Thanks! 
solution: 

issue: I am trying to look into dl4j core source so I figure out how to use UiConnectionInfo. mvn download sources does not seem to work. is dl4j core source available? it would be helpful if someone at least put up a example that displays a plot on UiSever from beginning to end otherwise, its time to give up 
solution: and download sources work as well. 

issue: raver119: Any other thoughts on what that screenBuffer may be, or why the size isn't as expected? Got it, appreciate the help nyghtowl: Yes, plan on it. I was going to mess with it a little more first though.  Looks like the screenBuffer is in image of some sort. In Python they're able to resize it using an image tool. If I can't get it i'll open up an issue nyghtowl: Any resources for making that image into an NDArray of the correct size? I got the buffer converted to an image and saved it to disk so I could confirm 
solution: 

issue: chaocharleswang: its not clear to me regarding the prediction issue. I'm looping in@AlexDBlackto see if he has insights 
solution: Tostino: you can load images into a record reader and initialize the record reader. This [<-LINK->] is a little more complex than what you need. Mainly pass the file into input split and take 100% of that dat and pass it into the record reader you initialize. Then call next and pull the featureMatrix to get an INDArray.. 

issue: Yes I am trying to autoencode Time series I was wandering because keras Autoencoder Implementation supports time series AlexDBlack: previous lines are answer to your comment. My phone just showed the notification 
solution: 

issue: I got question, man, does it work for scala 2.10.6 to comile datavec? I got a complilation error but I can compile datavec with scala 2.11.7 maven tool 
solution: 

issue: Are you using eclipse or command line? Or intellij? If you use mvn command line its 2 commands 
solution: Editing in intellij, but running mvn commands from terminal (on mac). For intellij you likely didnt import it right. 

issue: Does Nd4j or DL4j has a function for RMSE root mean squared error calculation? 
solution: 

issue: As talked before,@agibsonccc, I followed the page you've mentioned,but the error message shows me : dl4j/datavec/datavec-dataframe/src/main/java/org/datavec/dataframe/mapping/DateMapUtils.java:169: error:;' expected but{' found.

issue: usually that means there's some dependency problem (I'm assuming you are using intellij)i.e., it encounters an error and stops the import hehe if you did mvn eclipse:eclipse or whatever originally, try doing that again 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: If you're curious about the kind of research I will be doing next and why I think it could be relevant to high performance computing like neural net, this is a draft of my preliminary semester project II: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: when i set backprop(true) i get an error that i need an output layer to do it...    50 examples for a proof of concept that a prediction of time series can be done... in the model i use rbm layers agibsonccc: output layer is only bin, with 1 unit i get 1 or 0 result. I want a  unit as output to be double..

issue: [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-enforcer-plugin:1.4.1:enforce (enforce-default) on project dl4j-examples: Some Enforcer rules have failed. Look above for specific messages explaining why the rule failed. -> [Help 1] 
solution: 

issue: If I'm using NumberedFileInputSplit, is there a way to tell the model to ignore one of the columns in my csv files? 
solution: 

issue: I am trying to get the CUDA example working on Windows at [<-LINK->] . However, when I run the example I get: Error putting member offsets for class org/bytedeco/javacpp/cuda$CUstreamBatchMemOpParams.Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError. I\'ve added the following to POM:  [<-CODE->] What else should I do? 
solution: They are stored as floats or doubles so a lot more precision than 4 decimal points. 

issue: strangely I just started getting this: [<-CODE->] only difference is I moved from snapshot to 0.7.2, ideas? here's my deps list: [<-CODE->] let me try clearing the IntelliJ cache before we pull the fire alarm 
solution: uh uh. 

issue: HI, I was wondering if dl4j's nlp can do customized tokenization e.g. token tags are customized I would like to recognize in a set of sentences which words are related to a domain e.g. "what are the subsets in the cloud" I would like to tag subnet and cloud as resource types the token I want to use is "resourcetype" instead of verbs, nouns etc I am trying to translate user's questions into cyper queries so "what are the subsets in the cloud" would be translated into "match (n:subnet) where n-r-c and c.type="cloud" so I want to recognize in the sentence "subnet" and "cloud" are types I need ok, I see but if I have a lot of those questions, can I train it tho yeah, I was trying to build it and see if I can use dl4j I am lol I have used the examples in dl4j no 
solution: 

issue: hmm, there's a training component to this? I wonder if it's related to not setting a seed Have you tried running this multiple times to see what it gets? Iris is crazy volatile Run it a few times and see what it does It's the same every time? I would file an !issue then We need to update that and make that less error prone I don't have the bandwidth to look at this but@tomthetrainerwill get back to you :D 
solution: 

issue: Hi, when I build deeplearning4j CPU version, I got the following error message, do you know why? mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -pl '!:nd4j-cuda-8.0,!:nd4j-cuda-8.0-platform,!:nd4j-tests' Could not find the selected project in the reactor: '!:nd4j-cuda-8.0 
solution: 

issue: Tostino: Yes, Doom takes a while and need a lot of model tuning It would not be surprising if it didn't work out-of-the-box with the parameters from rl4j/dl4j-examples 
solution: 

issue: Stevod: if it's not clear could you file an !issue on nd4j? I'm not sure how more obvious we can make it If you have something you want to see then feel free to let us know we can change it to something else, like add a custom message for each backend I can't imagine it'd be hard An nd4jbackend can have a public abstract getLoadedMessage(); I'm not sure what it would say though 
solution: 

issue: i'm afraid that it's JCublasBackend name isn't obvious for him :( CUDABackend :) hm. that's actually cool idea lets add some details coming from backend i.e. device name etc we have it anyway will ease debugging i'll file an issue agibsonccc:  [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: OMG I love dl4j after those horrible horrible python frameworks. I just wanted to set learning rate per layer and you know what - there's setter for that! I dont have to hack around in backend or write own layer only to achieve that o/ And yesterday I tried the visualization - love it with all my gut 
solution: 

issue: rubenfiszel: Hey there Ruben, understood that this is a hard problem. Do you have any suggestions on how to go about getting even the most simple model trained? I've spent prolly 5 days on it now, and the main issue is not having any examples using rl4j that work. Everyone else I can find any info on is using one python framework or another, and even those are sparse on info 
solution: 

issue: I just mean in general, like how would you split it? I probably should have gotten my feet wet a bit more in the basics before jumping into this, so I apologize for my dumb questions 
solution: I would have hoped some contribution from community but it's a rather monolithic/one-man piece of work so I can understand the lack of momentum.. 

issue: Hi, if I want to build "nd4j-native-0.7.3-SNAPSHOT-android-arm.jar", I could only build it in Linux environment, but not in the windows environment?  the same for "nd4j-native-0.7.3-SNAPSHOT-macosx-x86_64.jar"? agibsonccc: I see how to use classifier. Then if I use maven in the window platform, I could only get the "windows-x86_64"? and could not get the "macosx-x86_64"? Right? 
solution: 

issue: Bren077s: so the model reports a loss which is also an MSE. The higher and lower numbers you are quoting, are they the loss? Ah, I bet the mae reported is opposite trend Is it? Those stats are collected on the scaled output between zero and one. 
solution: 

issue: rubenfiszel: Question, is there any reason that the history configuration has to have the width / height equal each other? Why can't it be 100x80 for example? I get an assertion error that the width and height are not the same for some reason 
solution: Set that before you run your gradient check. 

issue: okay. sorry!.  I am new to this i followed the steps to run examples from the website compiled them using mvn @agibsoncccuhh..not sure what an uber jar is 
solution: EVERY spark job ever uses them. New to everythin Spark as well as Dl4j. You might have sent the wrong jar to spark. 

issue: So my issue actually wasn't the resolution, I just am tired and was doing too many changes at once. It was that I went from 1 channel to 3 channels (greyscale to rgb) and I didn't change the network properly to expect that still having a bit of trouble getting that to work actually, but I should probably go to bed since it's 4am 
solution: 

issue: Is there any timeframe for when dl4j would be updating to spark 2.0? 
solution: he starts next week. 

issue: yep, i can't remember when someone asked about RBM last time nope. you're still here. 
solution: 

issue: Possib Sorry Possible to load Paragraph vector from file and continue training? Can't find working example about that. 
solution: it’ll be absolutely the same as for word2vec uptraining example, with all the same limitations. 

issue: is there anyway to speed up array creation performance imageArray = nativeImageLoader.asMatrix(new Mat(byteArrayOutputStream.toByteArray())); this line takes like 3 seconds to run i need it to be instantaneous 
solution: cuda backend with a 81x45 image, 3 channels. raver119: would you mind taking a look. 

issue: ecthx: interesting results:  Yes, setting render to true seems to allow it to run without an issue. When I set it back to false and tried again, it would run longer and the come back with an out of memory exception. I up\'d the heap to 4GB and it runs even longer now, but comes back with a different stack when the threads "crash": [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: if i switched to native backend would it improve? 
solution: 

issue: i can't send the code here? 
solution: 

issue: Does anyone have experience of LossCosineProximity? LossCosineProximity.scoreArray() precisely. There is an NaN problem when my code went to postOutput.mul(labels). "postOutput" is an INDArray as the return of a LSTM layer (with softsign), contains only +0.00 and -0.00, and "labels" is a pure ZERO INDArray. I manually tested the multiplication of two INDArrays,it normally returned a ZERO INDArray. What\'s the problem in the LSTM layer output? Any idea/sulotion? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: I did a maven install of the dl4j examples as a first step. Does that not install all examples? Do I have to run additional mvn install commands to install other examples? I mean mvn clean install The command should I have the word2vec examples available in intelliJ explorerafter I followed all the steps in the quick start? 
solution: it either imported or it didn't. I have examples, I even ran the MNIST example. 

issue: hey I am facing a small problem building an image pipeline Multilayer conf is expecting a rank 2 matrix but my feature matrix turns out to be of rank 4 thanks this should work 
solution: 

issue: aichemzee: mind adding some details? nope, not really we have InputType helper so conversion happens there for you that’s DenseLayer expects 1D/2D input not a multilayer conf 
solution: 

issue: Hello. I'm working with the word2vec implementation in DL4J.My question: Is it possible to train and save a model and then, after loading it into a Word2Vec object again (with WordVectorSerializer.readWord2Vec()),  use a new corpus to train additional vocabulary?In my tests I could re-train a model (and add vocabulary) multiple times before saving it to disk. But after saving and loading it again, it seems like I can't add vocabulary but only adjust the weights. (I also saw someone mentioning this restriction for an older version of DL4J on StackOverflow) @agibsonccc thanks. That is the code I used as a guideline for my tests, so far. Maybe I should use that exact code and experiment with it - but from reading the comments in the code it is not clear, if this just improves the weights or actually adds new words to the vocabulary. (of course, the latter would make more sense but I have also seen some contradicting statements. And loadFullModle() that is used there seems to be deprecated now.)So, is it possible to add new vocabulary to an existing model? If so, that's great, and I just need to find the error in my code / logic ;) 
solution: 

issue: Hi! i'm not experienced with maven i just had one question how do i add dl4j in my project ? 
solution: 

issue: Tostino: There are already issues for this problem. E.g.: [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: @glaed  > and uptraining is vectors update modeit’s not injecting new labels or words in vocab 
solution: 

issue: Hello all,          I am trying to transform the data using         SparkTransformExecutor executor = new SparkTransformExecutor();. But its depricated, can you please suggest what can be used? 
solution: 

issue: One more question regarding GPU performance, do I actually have to set CudaEnvironment.getInstance().getConfiguration.setMaximumDeviceCache or will the framework que this info automatically? 
solution: but if I have 12gb card and would like to utilize it?. better spend it on asynciterator buffer and precache more datasets. 

issue: @raver119 How does categorization happen with the DataSet iterators with a one-hot representation? Does it just assign them numerical values and use a conditional to output the textual label based on an array?Just trying to figure out the easiest way to setup an in-memory representation of my data so I don't have to write out/read in ~3M image files. Should I just convert my labels to vectors and feed that into INDArrays and, in turn, feed those to my DataSet objects? 
solution: 

issue: I know that the ND4J cpu backend can use OpenBlas or IntelMKL. Is there a way to check which specific version of cpu backend you are using? 
solution: Nd4j.getExecutioner().getEnvironmentInfo(). 

issue: raver119: thanks for all the superb hints. On CPU I needed about 1-2 Days to complete Epoch with my Corpus. GPU-Rig just completed Epoch in 4 Minutes!!! 
solution: 

issue: in the mean time it's just a loop, in the simplest case:while(iter.hasNext()){    DataSet ds = iter.next();    INDArray out = net.output(ds.getFeatureMatrix());    myEvaluationMethod(ds.getLabels(), out);} 
solution: That would be very helpful. often evaluation is batched though for efficiency. 

issue: I am try to do Anomaly detection on my own image I am try to do Anomaly detection on my own images, when dl4j does training it threw an exception: Exception in thread "main" org.deeplearning4j.exception.DL4JInvalidInputException: Input that is not a matrix; expected matrix (rank 2), got rank 4 array with shape [128, 1, 28, 28] 
solution: 

issue: I\'ve already answered your question."@dilipbobbyit\'s possible I\'ve got the example labels around the wrong way... let me run it locally and check"last I checked it was correct, but if not: it\'s probably just the labels around the wrong way 
solution: I've added  .setInputType(InputType.convolutionalFlat(28, 28, 1)). 

issue: I'm trying to use the CnnFeedForwardPreProcessor() method, but I'm unsure how to determine what the parameters should be. I receive an error saying expected shape is rowsX columns X depth  does not match the shape[72, 8970]. Can you point me in the right direction for reading material? AlexDBlack: if Height and width are not equal, is nOut =  Height Output X Width Output X Depth? 
solution: 

issue: as in you're manually handling the data import? that's possible, but using the built-in functionality is less error prone (and often faster)unless it's something really custom/unusual 
solution: 

issue: Anyone know of any good simple e-commerce data-sets?  The one I found on UCI has way too many products, my output layer has to be huge. 
solution: I wanted to show-case DL4J for recommendation.  Was thinking about using a kind of seq2seq model predicting the rest of the shopping cart after adding the first item..

solution: 

issue: you have 30x30 input, and 30x30 kernel size? show !gist with your configuration please that's misconfigured network you hadn't provided kernel/stride/padding/whatever_else to any of layers but that makes me wonder, why it doesn't complaints about it 
solution: 

issue: lefromage: any reason you are building from source? What os? All 3 should work Did you see [<-LINK->] ? Or [<-LINK->] That repo has files for various oses You are welcome to file an !issue on that script That script isnt usually 1 click though 
solution: 

issue: eraly: @turambarjust chatted with Alex, looking at importing a TensorFlow model...wondering if there would be any issues with weight ordering? I was thinking of using Keras as a proxy to do it, but not sure if there would be complications 
solution: it’s necessary to have some kind of standardized, shared model description. The Keras model config and weights saving are pretty well defined so we’re supporting that.. 

issue: Is there an example of how to use the ReplaceNans function somewhere? Ok cool.. but is there an example? logprob = Nd4j.getExecutioner().execAndReturn(new ReplaceNans(logprob,0.0)); not working... 
solution: And clip values like here, if you want valid probabilties. 

issue: For log(1/p) you can do -log(p+eps) everywhere and it shouldn't make a big difference? 
solution: 

issue: I have a brain freeze about recurrent nets... All I'm trying to do is to evaluate a test set that is a timeseries data... and I can't figure out how to do it? do I have to feed the data one by one? because if I try to do it the "normal" way I get mismatch in label and predicted dimensions 
solution: for the net, just use .output(INDArray features). 

issue: Hi, where can we find the appropriate groupId, artifactId and version for 0.7.3-SNAPSHOT? [<-CODE->] Error:Dependency '''org.nd4j:nd4j-native:0.7.3-SNAPSHOT''' not found less... (Ctrl+F1)Inspects a Maven model for resolution problems.

issue: Hi, I'm trying to implement an auto encoder for a NLP problem. So far I'm training this example [<-LINK->] with my own data. However I'm stuck on how to actually get the encoded values?  Should I just use the feedForwardToLayer(int layerNum, INDArray input) method from MultiLayerNetwork? 
solution: 

issue: Thanks..@raver119So I was using DBOW.. I guess that for my document classification problem, I should rather give a try to DM instead..  :-) 
solution: 

issue: This is definitely an anomaly :D What OS are you on? 
solution: 

issue: I can't seem to find org.deeplearning4j.deeplearning4j-ui-0.7.2.jar on mvnrespository. I find deeplearning4j-ui only up to version 0.6.0 there o_O found it 
solution: so it has scala binary versions in artifact name. 

issue: Yes I found it, I am trying to reduce size of fat-jar and failing horribly I have different issue with that, e.g.:java -Dorg.deeplearning4j.ui.port=8089 -cp deeplearning4j-play_2.11-0.7.2.jar:my-application.jar:play_2.11-2.4.6.jar... class params This causes: Loaded [CpuBackend] backend if I remove play_2.11-2.4.6.jar from classpath, Cublas is loaded!!!! 
solution: I have uberjar with almost everything except native and cuda. 

issue: are you creating uber jar that contains both, cpu & cuda backends? file and !issue please. 
solution: 

issue: uhm. what "reference values" would you expect? it's pretty unlikely someone with the same gpu as you have will be solving exactly the same task as you do 
solution: 

issue: Is there a learning rate policy that has a floor on the smallest value it can go? I've been experimenting with inverse which works fairly well for my purposes, but I'd really like something that decays relatively quickly, but can't go below a certain threshold. Cool, thanks, I'll give that a try As a side note, I'm still having issues with serializing models... I updated my issue, but it was already closed, so I'm not sure if you saw the comment.  [<-ISSUE->] Cool, appreciate it. 
solution: 

issue: hey can any1 help me this issue: I got 4 keras from [<-LINK->] ,  then i used commend "mvn clean install" it returns Could not find artifact org.deeplearning4j:dl4j-test-resources:jar:0.7.3-SNAPSHOT not really absolutely 
solution: 

issue: phstcfjz: My first thing I need to figure out here. Are you new to all of java? :D Eg: you don't get paid to do it at a job? ok so if I answer with maven terms you'll get it? :D I need to figure out if I should link a guide first or not 
solution: 

issue: instead the pom.xml and re-run the mvn clean install -DskipTests? 
solution: 

issue: I can't seem to find one. There will be a release very soon with it fixed. And we are always here so you can come back and ask here. 
solution: 

issue: lcasperr: you just need to provide paravec LabelledDocument's with multiple labels. So any method is ok. And important note here: go for DM learning algorithm straight ahead, for multiple labels it works significantly better then DBOW. fahman: yep, 2 days ago we've found out that for uber-top-gpu's (like titan) kernel launch params are suboptimal for mid-sized data. so it shines on large/small tasks, and not that good as should be on mid-sized. Fix will be applied soon. 
solution: 

issue: one option to minimize your jar sizes is to not use the -platform dependencies - they have binaries for all platforms just means you have to be careful when building on one OS and running on another 
solution: 

issue: On a single pc (Windows 10 x64) the UIServer I have problems finding css/js assets for the UIServer, e.g. DEBUG o.d.ui.play.staticroutes.Assets - Could not find asset: js/jquery-migrate-1.0.0.min.js . UIServer webpage is online but with old-school text only. What could be the cause? Version is 0.7.2 btw. Works fine on my primary dev pc - but not on the laptop. 
solution: 

issue: Yes, sure. My question what purpose a random number serves in a neural network ? 
solution: we’ll be introducing parameter server solutions for training on spark. 

issue: Just a hypothetical question, can it be that ParallelWrapper is doing bad things to my score? [<-LINK->] 
solution: however, there’s only 6 lines of info, not too much for real expetise, but nothing bad in those 6 lines. 

issue: im having a problem with running the Word2VecSentiment example, intellij wants me to edit the configurations but im not sure what to change them to. anyone else experienced this? 
solution: 

issue: so i finally have imported it all correctly but could someone please send me a viable copy of the GoogleNews Vectors to download? the link on the tutorial doesnt seem to work , and the version i found on github also is denying access when i run the file  [<-LINK->] 
solution: the google link is dead. 

issue: raver119: thx for the example but I still don't get wtf I have to do Nd4j.shuffle(arr, 1, 2) to get rows shuffled? I just want to shuffle along dimension 0 But what does the syntax say: shuffle from 1st dim along next 2 dims or what? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] i received that error message and cannot fix it by increasing the heap size no clue what the issue is? 
solution: 40164059: google model is 4GB+ worth of. for that example you’ll need around 6-8GB of ram solely for example. 

issue: yeye, I understood how I have to write it by looking at your ShuffleTests.java, I can now shuffle how I want But I dont understand why is this syntax, am reading now [<-LINK->] Bit tough for my brain :D yes but I cannot visualize yet 
solution: in this case you’re rolling along dimensions 1 and 2. 

issue: so 0,1 in 3d would shuffle columns then? e.g. if 0dim = sequences, 1dim = tokens, 2dim = embeddings, then 0,2 -> shuffle embeddings accross sequences but keep the token order whereas 0,1 -> shuffle tokens but wount move embeddings accross the rows can I make TAD along two dimensions? as in I want to shuffle rows AND tokens? something like 0,1,2? 
solution: 

issue: Hi there hi, yes. I recently started with dl4j and i'm struggling passing my data in the network 
solution: When it comes to the evalution it says my data is a 4D arrayand not a matrix. 

issue: Hi, I'm trying to import Inception v3 from Keras to dl4j. I managed to import the model from json+h5 by making few small tweaks to latest KerasModel class. However when I feed same data as to Keras's model, I get different results. Actually I'm always getting very similar, meaningless output - all 1000 values nearly equal to 0.001. I figured that during import dimensions are re-shuffled - Keras model takes shape of [1, 299, 299, 3], while dl4j expects [1, 3, 299, 299]. However, no matter how I permute/flatten the input, I never get anything meaningful - just this flat distribution of numbers close to 0.001. Any ideas? 
solution: 

issue: do you have anything amenable to keras Convolution1D?  [<-ISSUE->] is this being worked on ? 
solution: 

issue: crockpotveggies: re: cnn import,@eralypushed some changes to master that fixed the problems with the Theano backend 
solution: and that has required building out the model import stuff a bit more. 

issue: can anyone explain the internal working of word2vec...i am not able to understand. Directing to right website would also be great. Thanks 
solution: 

issue: I need your help how to solve this problem Parameter 'directory' is not a directory 
solution: 

issue: Hi, 0/0=NaN also appears in LossCosineProximity.computeGradient(INDArray labels, INDArray preOutput, IActivation activationFn, INDArray mask). And it could be fixed by the way you did in [<-LINK->] , they are actually the same. Ok 
solution: 

issue: raver119: Hi, i've the same old problem with GPU's [<-ISSUE->] any idea? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: how can i train on multi Gpu's without parallelwrapper? raver119: without parallelwrapper, so with only one Gpu, i don't have problems... raver119: sorry, I could not understand your question 
solution: 

issue: The other day I asked about learning rate policies and@AlexDBlack(I think)  suggested I implement a custom strategy using [<-LINK->] as a starting point. I'm only just now getting around to it have a new question. What is the variable parameter? I see it's used in the update method and called paramName, but it's not clear how I'd get it from my code. 
solution: 

issue: that certainly seems wrong — two things to try, if you haven’t already: (1) run the originally trained model on the validation set and check performance there to make sure the trained model performs as you expect; (2) print (some of) the parameters from the trained model and then after setting the production model’s params, print its corresponding params to make absolutely sure they copied properly. 
solution: 

issue: The original model trained on. Not the one with the params copied over? 
solution: now that I'm able to step through it, that also describes the NaN I was seeing in DataSetLossCalc yesterday. 

issue: ironflood: "i am using play framework for production... possible to use my existing play app to visualize the net training"in practice: probably not. we\'re using the java routing DSL and some other custom stuff (because Play\'s Maven support isn\'t great)in principle it may be possible, but it\'d take a reasonable amount of work I think 
solution: edb2016: "used or tried using regularization like l1 or l2 with dropout?"yes, dropout + l2 can definitely be used together without issue. l1/l2 penalize large weights, dropout is a bit like dynamic model averagingso different approaches and effects. 

issue: I'm running into an out of memory error despite Xmx14g, any suggestions? [<-LINK->] I do, but I don't know how to configure that 100 
solution: 

issue: What would a "document" with an "RNN" mean? Those 2 things are usually exclusive :D Problem is word2vec is usually used for that You still didn't answer my question :D I mean itmightsorta work? 
solution: you have encoder which consists of rnn layers that compress text sequence. At the end you take the last time step vertex. then at the end of encoder you have decoder that starts by repeating this very last vertex seqLength times and attempts to decode from this one vector the sequence again. 

issue: hey all. anyone have any recommendations for dl4j and clojure? that article looks like  agreat starting point anyway. many thanks! 
solution: I keep an eye for this stuff and wish we could be more help. 

issue: Hey guys, one question about the cuda 8.0 backend. Does the current GPU example work for this backend too? It seems like the CudaEnvironment class does not exist anymore. @agibsonccc Found the Problem: Nd4jBackend$NoAvailableBackendException: Please ensure that you have an nd4j backend on your classpath.My pom includes:<properties><nd4j.backend>nd4j-cuda-8.0-platform</nd4j.backend></properties><dependency><groupId>org.nd4j</groupId><artifactId>${nd4j.backend}</artifactId></dependency>What is wrong? 
solution: 

issue: Hi Everyone, a trivial question, i m using RecordReaderDataSetIterator, extending the example SingleTimestepRegressionExample, and i have an weird issue, i cant access the iterator unless i used the data to train  the model, it just gives me only one value... is that normal ? 
solution: 

issue: How calculated output of model.score()? Or is it a mean square error? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. Soarex16: ^^. 

issue: what's the DL4J equivalent of TensforFlow logits? also, I\'m currently implementing a resnet model in DL4J...I noticed it keeps using "scale", such asnet += scale * up....I assume there\'s no equivalent in DL4J yet?  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] core to the resnet methodology, but nothing I've seen in DL4J ah figured it out, this image explains the scaling very clearly [<-LINK->] turambar: there's no residual layer eh? I just realized that model import from Keras won't work without it 
solution: 

issue: I'm not seeing what the problem is here you've got one time series per file, right? and you're using CSVSequenceRecordReader 
solution: 

issue: Wait we're getting resnet too? :D Keep going :D huh 
solution: 

issue: HI all, newbie in DL4J here, have several high-level questions, is this right place to ask? tx 
solution: tx, Susan,  interested in extracting meaningful information from 100,000's academic medical articles; will be using some pipeline of NLP algos; what is performance of DL4J relative to Python's NLTK? (approximately, is NLTK 1.5x slower, 10x slower, 100x slower, etc.); I have access to Spark so can parallelize both (python and Java / Scala). thanks in advance. 

issue: fyi - [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: To summarize:Big project starting.Objective is to use big data / analytics to assist MDs in diagnosis (and perhaps some limited / basic automated diagnosis); all will run withing a clinical / hospital setting.I expect a lot of machine learning / deep learning / NLP but not clear on the details.The options are:start Python and then if all good simply move code to Python in production\nstart Python and then if all good convert / move to Java in production\nstart in R / Java / Scala and use Java libs; once ready, move all to productionI assume that you will tell me 3. above is better.Why? (btw, I am both a quant and engineer so not biased ;-) ) 
solution: I keep asking about the product stack because again it's usually a separate team that does that. 

issue: I can force them to start with Java / Scala / R (option [<-ISSUE->] ) if it makes sense your thoughts? data science in medicine is mostly R right now 
solution: 

issue: I would do your own research there. If it's a project with a small amount of users that isn't mission critical usually it's a small team of data scientists who just build something in python They don't need the scale A project with a larger budget that's mission critical will tend to be java 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: Hey! , i dont know if you remember yesterdays issue regarding the RecordReaderDataSetIterator,  its turns out that before i used the iterator i have to reset(), hasNext(), next() then reset() again before anytime using it .. not sure if this is an issue or there is something logically wrong ! 
solution: i was just saying i have a work around for it ..  and rechecking if there is something logically i dont understand. 

issue: agibsonccc: done! .. I hope my baby steps here are not annoying anyone .. Thank you all for your support 
solution: and make sure we can reproduce it. For gating do you mean GRU gating?. 

issue: I see ok! so the forget gate, input gate and output gate are actually sigmoids? I'm assuming we cannot change this in our config 
solution: so your options are sigmoid and hard sigmoid. I see okay! Understood. One more thing! The activation function I config within the layer gets applied to the LSTM unit output...is that correct?. 

issue: Is there an command in nd4j to get the number of the column with the highest value? 
solution: 

issue: You\'re the only one running in to any "problems" :D What exactly are you running in to? Are you using IE6 or something? heh 
solution: tried on chrome and FF. 

issue:  [<-ISSUE->] agibsonccc: jump for joy 
solution: 

issue: seen this before but can't remember the specific cause, I think it's a label issue? [<-CODE->] happens as soon as I start training 
solution: right, probably a configuration issue with the iterator.

solution: 

issue: volkanagun: it doesn't need to know the minibatch size, only the data dimensions...maybe post what you are trying to do (config, pipeline) in a !gist 
solution: 

issue: FYI, WordVectorSerializer.writeWordVectors() only worked with .readWord2VecModel() in deeplearning4j-nlp 0.7.2, but in my case .readWord2VecModel() failed in 0.7.2. It would be better if you could@Deprecatedit or just delete it. 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I am using GravesBidirectionalLSTM in my config and even tho I use BPTT it works! o_O Someone told me BPTT does not work with bidi lstm in dl4j, does it? 
solution: 

issue: BPTT is used to train every RNN evertruncatedBPTT doesn't work with bidirectional RNNs  [<-LINK->] 
solution: I have two bidi layers mixed with unidirectional ones. 

issue: bashartalafha: have you seen [<-LINK->] ? Your question was pretty general, you mentioned the use case but that that you were doing input/output I didn\'t read that as: "Does my output size need to be the same as my input size?" :D So it's not ideal..but we do have a seq2seq: [<-LINK->] Are you following a certain paper at all? 
solution: Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural NetworksIlya Sutskever,. So seq2seq as is.

issue: Hi all, I am new to DL4J. I am currently looking into the semantic similarity between various different hashtags and tweets. I searched and came to know that the Word2Vec could best serve my purpose. Yesterday, I ran the Word2Vec example but was having a difficulty using the TSNE Plotting (the feature is not available right now I guess). I would appreciate if anyone could please guide me to quickly find similarity between hashtags and tweets with visualisation. agibsonccc: I am sorry, I may have missed your comment. Thanks ! agibsonccc: I have already done that. I am bit struggling with understanding UIServer and plotting the results. raver119: That coords are already written to txt file if I use the Word2VecRawTextExample ? vec.lookupTable().plotVocab(tsne object, what this int represents, CSV file); Is my understanding correct ?@raver119

And this is the line that has the exception.I'm on 0.6 not 7 
solution: 

issue: So how can I upgrade to 0.7? 
solution: 

issue: funny how that class is from feedforwardlayerspace, that hierarchy is a bit misleading because LSTM is a type of recurrent not feedforward nyghtowl: but thanks

solution: 

issue: AhmedSarhanDL: your original configuration is fine, but cut the adagrad (use SGD updater), normalize your data properly, and maybe make sure you are giving it enough iterations/epochs to actually learn something (and make sure your learning rate isn't too large/small) CNN, most definitely 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys, general question: for detecting whether a photo contains a firearm (output being a single value 0 to 1), would you use deep-belief net or one of CNN/Inception networks? I thought so, but I had a look at this table: [<-LINK->] and if I understand it correctly, it kind of suggests to use deep-belief to this task (I\'m not sure if the task I described is "binary image recognition" but that\'s how I interpreted it) AlexDBlack: with CNN - should I make the output layer to be a single scalar (0 = doesn\'t contain and 1 = contains) or a vector of two, one being "contains" and another "does not contain" ?

solution: 

issue: Hi, I was wondering if there's a way to visualize a computationGraph using DL4J UI (or something similar) without having to use a statsListener. I have a pretty complicated network architecture that's running into an issue while training so it's not actually completing an iteration, and having a graph view of the network to make sure that everything's connected properly would help immensely with debugging. (I've already checked the ComputationGraphConfiguration's JSON and everything looks OK in there, but I'm still running into issues.)

issue: Hy, sorry to disturb, but Ive got a problem with installing dl4j thanks@raver120 i have followed the instructions: [<-LINK->] but, when I run one of the examples, I get the error saying: Unfortunately you can't use DL4j/ND4j on 32-bit x86 JVM but my default version of java is 64 well, i tried the 64-bit launcher and it gives the same error does it make a difference if it is in the folder Program Files(x86)? 
solution: anyway, from looking at it: you've probably mixed versions of dl4j/nd4j/rl4j/datavec. 

issue: running in intellij? 
solution: try the 64-bit launcher, intellij comes with 2. and I think it comes with is own JVM as well?. 

issue: guys, I opened a question on stackoverflow, re rl4j exception  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] haha works

issue: In the ParagraphVectorsClassifierExample, it uses MeansBuilder to generate the vector of a document. What are the differences between MeansBuilder.documentAsVector and ParagraphVector.inferVector if I use PV-DBOW? In my test data, I just found means builder is more accurate than inference. Should the inferred vector be more precise? I was using the ParagraphVectorsClassifierExample.java in the dl4j-examples. I have 70,0000 document. Found means vector better than inferred vectors. Can't figure out why >_< All documents are labelled, by tw btw 
solution: originally when i was adding inference to paravec, i've added only pv-dm.

issue: hey guys, I'm having a strange problem - after a certain iteration, all my iteration scores are NaN afterwards I'm testing with the AnimalsClassifcation code, but I replaced the deprecated methods and added options only I am using intellij 
solution: 

issue: Hello everybody! i need to classify my documents into two classes YES or NO, these documents are resume/cv. As you know there is a lof of noise data (like hobbies, personal info, contacts etc etc)        YES means that the person is a representative (sales agent) NO ...means? no! :) my doubt is regarding the correct approach to this task. you gave me a good classification example (RNN) on film reviews. My problem is that resumes do not follow the same structure, many are simple letters, many follow the EU format etc etc sometimes i can have "from 2010 to 2014 sales agent for Company ltd". So, these are not complete sentences. However back the my task, do you think the "classification" (rnn) approach is the correct way....or.... should i use a dictionary to lookup the keywords?..obviously with a dictionary i will lose the "context" (surrounding tokens)..so maybe  i can get "i am looking for a job as representative" (that does not mean it is a representative) it is a wish. Could anyone give me his opinion?

solution: 

issue: that's not a network issue; it's either a legitimate memory issue or one due to your configuration (xmx values, etc) what GPU are you running? 
solution: 

issue: I have some progress from yesterday. :) @AlexDBlack you were right, we need to use 3d arrays when working with RNN.I got the output, but now it seems the NN was not tuned properly :)Please, answer my stupid question:On input I have 60 numbers (and 60 labels when training (1s and 0s/peak or not a peak))For every new 60 samples of signal, on the NN output I should get 60 result labels, classified from the net.Now, the number of labelClasses should be 60 or 2 (from 1 and 0)?When using 60, I get a lot of warings like "class XXX was never predicted by the model", and when using 2 I get error that "Labels array numColumn does not match output layer number of outputs". The data is normalized...

solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: thank you! did you see my question above? bascically i need to classify my documents into YES or NO class so a kind of binary classification BUT my problem is that i must take the order of tokens into the accout.... because "i am a sales agent" = YES     i am NOT a sales agent" = NO   so the not here is fundamental. I thought about a classifier because as i wrote above the resumes/cv do not follow the same "format", sometimes are simple letters, other EU resume format (so they are semi-strctured) etc etc... what approch do i need to follow for you? agibsonccc: yes like sentiment analisis but the problem is thati cannot use something like naive bayes because it does not look at sequence so bascially doc2vec? or LSTM ? 
solution: 

issue: I'll restart from scratch and do it with maven (and read the rest of the tutorial ;)) 
solution: 

issue: can i skip the tokenize step if i provide my documents already tokenized ? 
solution: damianoporta: if you can pre process your docs for spaces the default one is space separation.

issue: Hi there, I'm have issues trying to use the TimeStepRegression examples with my own data. While using the regression evaluation it seems to increase the predicted data at every epoch, outputting question marks in the end (probably caused by too large Integers) 
solution: 

issue: hm, if you want the top N classes? you might be able to do something along the lines of thatwe don't have this, but a native op that returns the index of the values after sorting might be useful for that I certainly can't think of a one (or just a few) lines solution to get the indices of the top N

issue: started training, now it is 6 up to 7%  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] its runing on ubuntu server  [<-LINK->] raver119: here... AsyncDataSetIterator? 
solution: cpu tab = tab with graphs of cpu/gc usage. the CPU peaks are when garbage collector executes. 

issue: c0der1337: @raver119I got rid of the version declaration there. and could you clarify "not working" exactly? "As balacned as you can get it" Maybe use weighted loss functions? 
solution: 

issue: null score usually means crash during execution for that configuration, or your test data is empty config looks fine, and you'd get a protty obvious error if there was a problem there so I'd check the test data no, they are completely different things read the javadoc for them - that should explain it

issue: Hi, I built locally from master and tried to import Inception v3 from Keras (Theano backend) but it fails with NPE.  I was told import from Keras-Theano should work..  or it it not merged to master yet?  I tried importing this network: ' [<-LINK->] ' 
solution: 

issue: rohrl: the latest model import stuff is in the kerasModelImport branch but should be merged imminently. However, Inception is not officially supported yet. It likely will work as all its constituent layers are supported, but we haven't tested it as thoroughly as VGG, for example. We welcome folks testing it ahead of our efforts and any feedback -- and most especially PRs!

solution: now I don't have, I can paste them later, but my case is that the anomaly points are just tiny part of all  the data set, may be less then 3%. 

issue: siawlinglo: yes, you'll need to build libnd4j.

issue: using the ModelSerializer (like in [<-LINK->] )  I find that when I run the network on the test list there are difference in the results  between the original network and the saved one . In my case out of 60 labels there are difference in around 10 labels (the first ones(?)) and the biggest difference is around 0.04 (label with value of  0.2 becomes 0.196) compared in memory and saved net.params() and net.getLayerWiseConfigurations() - they are identical as expected

issue: edb2016: i have tagged it as a bug and asked@AlexDBlackto look at it. but please keep in mind that he's working on other things, so we cannot promise a quick turnaround. no one is tasked with labeling all issues. so you should feel free to label your own. 
solution: chrisvnicholson: I wasn't able to add a label. Is that a permissioning problem?. 

issue: bartvollebregt: we know there is a lot of overhead there, a pipeline interface will hopefully solve this eg: pipeline.save(..) would call ModelSerializer, normalizer save,transform process save (datavec),. That is on my todo list

Add momentum to configuration to change the value. lol. Well this is just one example of output. There is always some output to be expected. i generate architectures on the fly, and settings are sometimes used, sometimes not and architectures can be invalid. So it generates a ton of output

solution: 

issue: Hello everyone. Hopefully I do not disrupt you in anything, but I have a short question regarding ND4J.argMax(). I call the function passing the output of a MultiLayerNetwork as INDArray parameter and 1 as dimension. Using the prediction output on data known to the net the argMax function returns a RowVector as expected. But if I pass the prediction output of unknown data it returns a matrix. Even though the dimension is still set to 1. Do I misunderstand the argMax function? raver120: thank you :)

solution: yes, you'll have to build whole stack manually. 

issue: hmm, data question, I'm having gradient trouble, its erratic and I can't get it to descend in an orderly manner.  One solution (I've tried most parameters) would be to clean my data so that 1-6e floats are out, or maybe even 1-e4s.  Highest ones are 1e-2.  Do you think I should do this or is it a waste of time? the data is 4 features and this is a dbn with 40 nodes and 8 layers (autoencoder thingy, 40-20-10-5-10-20-40)  [<-LINK->]

issue: Hi all. I wanted to implement something very much like ParagraphVectors but with a few minor tweaks. So I thought I'd find the code that ParagraphVectors uses to build the network and then modify that. I expected that if I dug through the code I could find aComputationGraphbeing constructed that implements word2vec and/or ParagraphVectors but I couldn't find it. Does anyone know if this exists and/or where to find it? I also thought about just coding it up myself without the reference but I can't figure out how to do either hierachical softmax or negative sampling. Is there a way to do that for a normal ComputationGraph? There doesn't seem to be anything appropriate in org.nd4j.linalg.lossfunctions.LossFunctions.LossFunction. 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: happy to file an issue. If I did, do you have a sense for how long it'd take to get that kind of question answered if I did file an issue? I know this is free open software and you are all busy. You certainly don't owe me a response to a bug report or anything. I'm asking because I've got something I need to build in time for a deadline and am evaluating frameworks. I see how to do exactly what I want with TensorFlow but their Java implementation is new and they say it's buggy. You guys seem more Java focused so I'm inclined to use DeepLearning4j provided I can figure out what I need to figure out in time to get things done. Make sense?

issue: I am trying to model a seq2seq (english to french translator) in dl4j,  what I understand is I have to use time series of different length, so I am using SequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator but I am not sure what numPossibleLabels would mean, does it mean vocabulary size or the max lengthof the sentence. 
solution: 

issue: i was planning to do that but this seemed to do most of the work I intended to do. I also noticed that in the input layer configuration we have to provide the feature vectorsize, but since this is translation its not fixed, whats the work around. Or would this be a problem for one input with continuous feed? 
solution: worse case scenario I don't see why copying and pasting the class and making your modifications to that wouldn't hurt. 

issue: My search keywords were prediction using DL4J. That redirected me to 'Using recurrent neural networks in DL4J'. Also as I told you before (maybe the way I did it was wrong) I kept getting an exception 'Label names are not defined on this dataset. Add label names in order to use getLabelName with an id'.

I'll try that. I was using a model from [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: I’ve slightly modified the seq2seq example with dl4j to make a language transformer. But instead of using hot encoder I’ve used word2vec to encode the data. The problem I am facing is the score is always NaN, I did not expect it to work perfectly but a NaN is simply confusing, any pointers on what might be wrong? 
solution: 

issue: so if I create a translation model using word2vec vectors, I would not have any way to convert the translated vector back to target language 
solution: but w2v vectors are full of floats. so strict equality will be definitely impossible. but getting CLOSE vectors/words for a given vector - IS possible. 

issue: usually you’re getting values like 1.000001232 etc? or, say, 2.0? 
solution: in some cases that’s fixable, in others that's not.. 

issue: (sorry for the spam of questions, but changing the data type to double will double the size of my vectors? This already consumes a lot of memory - is it also supposed to?) 
solution: 

issue: how do I restart model training (from serialized model w/ updater state) at a different learning rate? doesn't appear to be any methods available after [<-CODE->] should I use something like network.setConf()? or does that erase previously trained parameters? 
solution: 

issue: want me to open an issue? 
solution: 

issue: In the doc, most of the stuff talks about how to run examples, but very few talks about how to use it in existing projects. 
solution: Well usually it's look at the examples pom.xml for things you need for an existing project. 

issue: "Randomizes the order of paths in an array and removes paths randomly to have the same number of paths for each label." based on that I'd expect it to remove a lot of the images

issue: one more question: if I grab an external GPU for my macbook, am I still going to need to worry about local memory? right now sporting 8GB on my Air, wasn't sure if most of the data is just pushed into the GPU mem 
solution: it's on both, so yeah, you still need to think about it. 

issue: I feel like I\'ve asked this before... does ND4J have something that lets you define an operation graph "ahead of time", and then optimize the operation graph before actually evaluating it on some input data?

issue: Is there any change in structure of data returned by model.paramTable() function ? 
solution: 

issue: is there something built-in that can add extra info to a vector by reading a dictionary? ( i am doing data-aumentation). It is not very difficult..i am kist asking if there is something like that :)

issue: Hello all --  I'm a beginning user of dl4j and nd4j.  My short term objective is to get one of the examples provided with dl4j - in particular, LenetMnistExample.java - running on an ARM board.  I have managed to get it running in a reasonably straightforward manner on a Linux system in IntelliJ Idea.This is an encouraging start, but I'm not only going to have to get out of IntelliJ and run it from a command line, but also be able to build the individual components so that they run on the ARM board.  I'm soliciting advice as to what my first steps ought to be.I initially thought that building nd4j should be first, but since that fails to build from the git archive, perhaps not.  So - where should I start? 
solution: 

issue: When I'm using LSTMs for classification and I have a dataset that has sequences with different lengths do I have to make sure I don't have a label with the value 0? Ah, I'm using an embedding layer so there might be a 0 in the input. 
solution: 

issue: I think@AlexDBlackis already working on internal randomization right now there's aRandomPathFilter it also helps with randomization 
solution: 

issue: actually...are there any papers discussing the relationship between batch size and learning rate? (it's OK if this is too outside DL4J topic) my google-fu skills can't find anything whoops meant to say training set size but yea, not much published I'm going to give it a shot manually

I am trying to build sth simple using iterator because for my other task I have my data in txt file encoded as json objects and I would need custom iterator to load the data. 
solution: svkap: I can't see immediately what the problem is there, but for small/toy problems putScalar like you are using is finecouple of other suggestions: looks like you are doing regression, not classification - you'd want identity activation + MSE loss function for thatalso cut the TBPTT configuration there, you don't need it for such a small data set. 

issue: are you using imagerecordreader with large training set? ok. probably same problem though... GC with large number of small objects one simple workaround is to save your DataSets first, then load them for training without the wordvectors in memory  [<-LINK->] plus DataSet.save should be all you need as in while(dataSetIter.hasNext()) dataSetIter.next().save(new File(...))as a first separate step that approach doesn't, unfortunately 
solution: 

issue: jsteggink: this is known issue with GC, and after current set of tasks solved - we’ll focus on it. why not sure we welcome additional functionality

solution: 

issue: sdamashek: I ran the model in both Keras and DL4J. Outputs exactly match. For what it’s worth, I’m getting real valued outputs that go up well over a thousand, etc. that makes sense since your output layer is a ReLU so they’re not “squished" first two elements are zero in both Keras and DL4J it’s possible there’s something wrong in DL4J 0.7.2 Gist of my code  [<-LINK->] I converted your input to Numpy text file format, but it matches so my recommendation is invest your time in building from master that has been tested extensively and a variety of architectures work and i can confirm that it works for your specific output 
solution: and master will give you properly working ConvNets on both TensorFlow and Theano backends, import for VGG, etc.. 

issue: turambar: that's weird... were the first two elements approximately 0? Did you run it in DL4J 0.7.2? And could I see your DL4J code? It's also possible it's something weird with running it on Android yeah, same here, expected output goes something like [[0, 0, 1385.68, 0, ...]] are you using my DL4J code?

solution: 

issue: Any ideas are welcome for my use case! ;-) 
solution: and full corpus size in gigabytes. well, that’s a bit of bruteforce. but you definitely shouldn’t need that. i’m building from master mutiple times per day, and most of time i do that without cuda. 

issue: When I use UIServer.getInstance() I get Exception in thread "main" com.typesafe.config.ConfigException$Missing: No configuration setting found for key \'play.crypto.provider\'. Any ideas? thanks@raver120. A previous answer to this question here ( [<-LINK->] ) says not to use Spark + UI in the same instance, however, I am not using Spark. 
solution: 

issue: is it OK to do this if I don't want to provide labels for the purpose of feeding a DataSet forward for .output()? [<-CODE->] actually... 
solution: even if it’s not - you can set features as labels too. well, that solves your problem then :). 

issue: could anyone advice me a good gpu? :D wow! 1k GPU? :) i am starting with DL 
solution: i got this one:  https://smile.amazon.com/GeForce-Dual-Fan-Gaming-Graphics-DUAL-GTX1070-O8G/dp/B01JHQSZ40/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1481579793&sr=8-1&keywords=ASUS+GeForce+GTX+1070+DUAL-GTX1070-O8G+8GBI use it for numerical sequence classification and it's more than enough. 

issue: sragrawal: can you post your pom file? it's not clear what is/isn't a transitive dependency there

issue: AlexDBlack: I've had that same problem in Gradle, I think it's a Typesafe issue sorry,Lightbendlol 
solution: 

issue: Newbie data reading & handling question:  how would I read in, from CSV, a  DataSet which has  (a) no known true labels (e.g. a true test set for which I want probabilities, and (b) continuous targets as some columns of the input CSV Why do I need a transform?  I have figured out how to read in CSV data with a binary target (has to be an integer 0 or 1, not 0.0 and 1.0, I found as an undocumented feature) my question is how do I make CSVRecordReader accept a continous label, and no label at all? 
solution: These seem like very common cases.   Continuous targets or otherwise externally generated from classes, and of course the case of scoring a dataset which has no classes.. 

issue: Is it necessary that I have to use intelliJ IDE ? No right? Before starting I want to know will that cause problems in integrating. The maven. anyone? 
solution: 

issue: intellij is not necessary, but we find it has the best integration for things like maven 
solution: 

issue: Frankly you won't get much support from us using eclipse or vim or whatever you use to build java apps We just don't use it 
solution: like I said we don't use it. 

issue: yeah not a big deal at all, just really helpful. intelliJ is also really good. but hey they person I learned java from is a big fan of maven+spring+hazelcast+intelliJ so maybe I'm biased 
solution: 

issue: I noticed INDArrays are utilized quite a bit thoughout the library, which reminded me a lot of tensors from differential geometry. Has anyone looked into implementing something similar to a curvature tensor? 
solution: A lot of people are interested in predicing the next valoe of a time series using ML. In finance, options traders look at a lot of partial derivatives (greeks) to make predictions about future values. The data sets are just (n+1)-dimensional time series (n non-time variables) and so you can sort of smooth out the noise and pretend that it is a 1-dimensional manifold in n+1 space, and then maybe the curvature is a really good input for a neural net. 

issue: Guys I got an error message when I was trying to use GPU.Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: org.nd4j.linalg.factory.Nd4jBackend$NoAvailableBackendExceptionI have included nd4j-cuda-8.0, nd4j-cuda-8.0-platform, and nd4j-jcublas-7.5 (I hope 7.5 and 8.0 are compatible here). I have no idea actually. The names confused me alot The thing is there is no jcublas-8.0 on maven. Does that mean I need to build it myself ? 
solution: 

issue: Hy,I would have a simple question regarding the installation. As I remember I have read a post somewhere, sometime (but I can't find it again) about having problem on linux due to setting JAVA_HOME at wrong location (either/etc/profileor/etc/environment).Could you please tell me if there is a preferred location setting JAVA_HOME for working with dl4j?Moreover, does it matter if I useopenjdkororacle jdk?Thank you very much! 
solution: 

issue: guys i am seeing this example [<-LINK->] there is features/ and labels/ folders the first has the prices...the second the classes 1-6, i would like to understand if i can add more feature (per column) as feature for example open price, high/low prices etc.. it is only an example..i am not building a trading system ahah...just to understand if i can feed more features in that way 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Now my question is: does this make sense? The values of the input nodes after calling feedforward are either 0.0 or 1.0, so my assumption is that nodes == 1.0 make a positive contribution, whereas those that are 0.0 don't. But is this correct? Am I approaching this the right way? Thanks! 
solution: 

issue: hey guys, i\'ve got a question regarding to TSNE, i am not an expert and have only a basic understanding about the math but i found this strange. The original paper describes euclidean distance to find the k nearest neighbors. But the DL4J implementation uses a inverted / negated "cosinesimilarity" as default. The tensorflow embedding projector seems to use cosine distance (1 - cosine sim). Shouldn\'t it be in DL4J also cosine distance and not a negated similarity?

issue: edb2016: so as usual it's a !tuning problem I'm not sure if I've linked you the numerical optimization chapter on deeplearningbook.org yet but as usual it has a source it could be from normalization or numerical underflow edb2016: divide by zero depending how you normalize certain batches or labels could end up with an exact zero mean or standard deviation like I said it could also be numerical underflow I wouldhighlysuggest understanding optimization:D Your point? You are normalizing the labels right? (if not you should be)

issue: thing is all of the SequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator constructors require me to specify a minibatch size? so do I specify 1 or 0? 
solution: agibsonccc: So the number of record or rows like 1800 for train and 207 for test?. 

issue: Thanks @wmeddie, the up-sampling is not really my problem, it is more at the loss evaluation stage. [<-CODE->] If I attach a standard  output layer to the CL, the network ends with a fully connected  section that I don't really need ... 
solution: 

issue: Hy,I have read in one of your answers, that nd4j does not support gpu's with cuda capability under 3.0. I assume it still holds, could you please confirm it? 
solution: i know one user did that, and it worked. then i better look for a better gpu, thanks :). 

issue: gabriel-skantze: there’s multiple possible explanations for that starting from small problem dimensionality ending with already known gc issue what’s your dataset dimensionality?

issue: my brain is only semi-functional at the moment, sorry, have been teaching C from 8 to 4I'm a bit struggling with the single step idea, I was reading something about it an hour ago (Keras example), and still not sure if I got it 
solution: as far as i got, it seemed that for multistep I\'d need to "manually" multiply the inputs... and that somehow feels redundant. 

issue: I have a question about the API . I search for the implementation of the abstract method of the Interface   IOutputLayer  :" computeScore(double fullNetworkL1, double fullNetworkL2, boolean training) " ;I search in the classes : BaseOutputLayer ,OutputLayer ,Layer ,Classifier .But I dont found any concrete implementation ;

solution: 

issue: I created a CNN, the F1 score is 0,40. I saved it , and reload it. with same test data, the F1 score become 0,24.But if i add if(FALSE)ModelSerializer.writeModel(model, locationToSave, false); the F1 score become 0,40 in the end of program, this line of code didn't exectuded. but it changed the F1 score of my evalutation. They are in a static main class someone can tell me why ? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: pardon for the question.. you told me i can augment the data without big problems...but do you think i should add specific feature that compare the previous value...example, if the current value is 10 and the previous is 9. does it make sense to add a feature like "UP" or "DOWN" or something like that ? 
solution: 

issue: am I missing something? wanted to take a look at the multi time step example for regression... but I don't seem to have the training data? some mismatch with my systems paths 
solution: 

issue: I made a ShufflingNumberedFileSplit that works wonders but rewriting it in Java is a bit of a pain. That works too. Is there a known issue with BatchNormLayer working on CPU but not on GPU? I get an NDArray indexing error. Yeah, same config working on CPU but get an error right away on GPU. 
solution: 

issue: wmeddie: maybe post the code in an issue on datavec and someone can port it? no but as usual define "not working" the same gradient checks that run on cpu run on gpu I'd be careful to call it not working o_0 As usual I need 1 billion things from you to diagnose if there is a problem or not :D mind filing an !issue and giving us something to reproduce? 
solution: 

issue: I choose these values because the training on cpu (openblas) was fast and seems to improve performance. At the beginning I load all training data into RAM. So ETL should not to be an issue, or? What do you thing are appropriate values for mini batch size and hiden layer (int the paper they use 745 units in hidden layer and batch size is not mentioned). Training examples are around 250.000 Will read your links first, thanks for help

solution: 

issue: dears .. running a toy exercise using gpus and i get MemcpyAsync failed exception .. is there something i should read about memory and gpus ? having Out of [DEVICE] memory, host memory will be used instead: deviceId message does not sound good also .. is there a rule for the memory ? 
solution: yes but it is a small network .. 350 input 5000 nodes or something .. just a toy to learn ... 

issue: Yes, I already have nd4j in my dependencies from when I toyed around with it earlier. Just not sure how to include the dl4j into my dependencies. agibsonccc: not expecting you to :D But thank you still for the guidance, I can work with this agibsonccc: I got the dependencies in, thank you again! I'm trying to work with [<-LINK->] now. Is the code at the top up to date? Hm, NeuralNetConfiguration.Builder seems to not have a method backprop. Only ListBuilder seems to Also, .build() seems to return NeuralNetConfiguration, not MultiLayerConfiguration 
solution: I would highly suggest looking through our !examples as you're doing this. 

issue: Is there a rule of thumb on how many layers I need for my net? 
solution: 

issue: Sure. It's really very cryptic right now and there are definitely ways to make it easier for users with a nice API like the one Alex describes in the issue. We'd love contributions :) 
solution: 

issue: eraly: thanks for the clarification. Indeed, that vertex needs some explanation. As I understand it, I'll get the same input at each decoder timestep then? Oh, sorry I missed the first explanation 
solution: Then the net is feedforward again where the output of the first time step of the decoder is fed in as the next output of the decoder.Shouldn\'t it say "the next input of the decoder"?. 

issue: No. These are fine. The ratio is log 10. So your update ratios don't dip below 10^-5 or go above 10^-3. I wouldn't worry about that. Exploding gradients would swing up much higher and vanishing would sink pretty low. 
solution: 

issue: FlyingPiggyKing: didn't we already talk about this twice now? I already gave you an example to use and how it identifies the anomalies Re asking the same question doesn't really help either of us oliverdain: shouldn't be; feel free to file an !issue and maybe we can look closer at batch inference Why not filter though?

solution: 

issue: markroxor: the answer still doesn't change, doing this by hand is not supported, and you are going in to a world of pain for no good reason. You don't need maven to run an uberjar. As you are running the example anyway, you can just runmvn packagein the examples directory and it will produce a large single jar file that you can pass as the classpath.

issue: What is a quick way to  get the output from a trained network and save it csv format similar to the training data set format (read using CSVRecordReader)? I tried CSVRecordWriter  but it serializes in a different format ( '[' in output?) ! agibsonccc: I made this gist [<-LINK->] in hopes of finding the issue, but it works!

solution: 

issue: treo: ok, understood. I can't figure out how to put this in code though. treo: the NDArray is basically just a table, yes? So I can put data at the xth row/yth column. Where do I put the timestep then? (Or how would the .put call look if not .put(row, column, data) Ok, so how do I construct this in terms of code? Well, I looked at the examples. It's done with .rnnTimestep here. Is that that then? Just put batches in, seperated by day?

issue: Hello, can the labels be 2 or more columns? I built a regression model, and the data has 5 columns in total, I want to pick 3 of them as features and 2 as labels,  is it feasible? thanks! 
solution: 

issue: I see that there's multilabel regression as default now, with a recordreaderdatasetiterator(recordreader,batchsize,labelindexfrom, labelindexto, regression=true), can I use it with just the same number for the labelindexes if I want to regress just one label? or alternatively, whats the point with the converters? hazarding a guess I'd gather I can convert between types, but why would I want to?/what if I don't need to? is there a dummy converter? alignments don't work with labels, as it just pads it with 0s so it can't really pad the labels. if I hazard a guess. 
solution: 

issue: Hi All,I'm using LSTM and would like to load the training time series which is in separate files and the input and labels are in the same file. I've loaded the training and test data as follows [<-LINK->] I just would like to add AligmentMode. So can I add it coz  I think the constructor did not accept it. keskella: I might be wrong but what i've understood about the Alignment mode is when the time series length is different from the other time series length. e.g.1st time series is 780567x1292nd time series is 85420x129is that wrong? actually the first 128 columns for the features and the last for label 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: yeah, would definitely be better/nicer if there was built-in batch inference. Will file a bug for that. In the meantime, the inference time is so long that's it's literally costing us hundreds of dollars in EMR charges so I was just looking for a quick way to speed things up. Any advice on a working hack that might speed things up a bit (even a factor of 2 would be huge) until you guys have time to do the batch thing? Issue here: [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: damianoporta: It's not looking at the N - current token directly, it's looking at the context state generated from that token. It then updates the weights that generated that context state appropriately. Yes, not the same thing, but similar.  You can think of backprop through time as making a window for you, but you don’t get to choose the features.  It’s also much harder to use and train RNNs.

However, where can I download the JSON file storing VGG16 configuration and HDF5 archive storing weights (I think I probably found this here [<-LINK->] ). Thank you so much. Dear all, I try to load VGG16 using KerasModelImport. However, I got an exception, see: [<-LINK->] . What is the reason? In addition,  the importKerasModelAndWeights doesn't take 3 arguments. So I cannot enforceTrainingConfig=false. Thank you very much. I am using version 0.7.2 for deeplearning4j-modelimport. ptah23: Yes, I do follow the build_vgg_webapp, but got the exception. 
solution: 

issue: app86: things like dependencies in profiles or exclusions don't work very well with previous versions, but it's not a hard requirement, it's possible to use 3.0, still.... 
solution: daredemo: binaries for linux-arm are not avavailable on the central, you'll need to build them yourself for now. app86: the idea with binaries for Linux is to build them on some old distro, like CentOS 6 (with Docker, makes things easier), then those binaries work on pretty much all other distro. 

issue: treo: and other admins, when will the next version of dl4j be released? I think the version 0.7.2 doesn't well support model import. When I tried to reproduce the VGG-16 webapp [<-LINK->] using 0.7.2, I got an exception. But if I don't use keras from Maven, while using the codes cloned from Git instead, the VGG16 model can be loaded. 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys,I have an exception in my code snippet belowand the full exception is in the file too [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: by reading [<-LINK->] i'm wondering why in dl4j softmax is a activationfunction and not a loss function? daredemo: thats the point, i dont understand why they call it "cross entropy loss(softmax)" and compare it to the hinge loss ... ..as an alternative for the hinge loss 
solution: 

issue: dwr-psandhu: Not really. The best I can think of is flatten the array to 1d and use array utils reverse and then reshape to whatever shape you want. There aren't many use cases we've come across that require reverse. We don't support negative strides in the underlying array structure right now. If memory is not a huge issue the flatten to new array to reshape is a perfectly fine workaround.

issue: michael20at: Do you see the same behaviour with the native backend? It could be a known issue that is being worked on.  [<-ISSUE->] But I'd rather@agibsonccccomment. 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I\'m a potential new user who is "shopping" for DL frameworks with which to build a project.  I would prefer to use DL4J since my domain code is already in Java, but the neural network (possibly computation graph) I have in mind does not align well with the examples in the documentation.  While there are many quirks that I intend to implement, the main one is that I need Flip-Rotate-Pooling Convolution filters.  Basically, each filter needs to be able to detect features in any of the eight orientations in terms of 90-degree rotations plus horizontal and vertical flipping, and to be able to train based upon which orientation as used.  Are these sorts of convolutions supported? eraly: , thank you for responding.  I don't think augmenting the input is viable since I am working on a Go AI, not an image processor.  I am willing to write my own implementation of FRPCs in DL4J, but I have not found any tutorials about how I would do that. 
solution: 

issue: eraly: How do I provide my expected values for weight adjustment? I really don't get how to provide my data. I would expect a method of sorts (data, expected output) And train that with different data until I approximate my expected output 
solution: eraly: I did just that. From what I can see this is pure classification. I don't want to classify data though, I want to predict the next in series (actually the next+10 in series). 

issue: I’m getting ajava.util.zip.ZipException: error in opening zip filewhen trying to load a large W2V model (~16 GB).

issue: Hi all, I want to use Word2Vec for Persian language so i need utf-8 for everything, Should i compile everything again with Maven and add utf-8 config to pom.xml? 
solution: Mmva2142: I think so, yes.. You would have to figure out tokenization. Or if you already have tokenized data it should not be any different with another language.. 

issue: Hi Adams..I followed the Word2VecSentimentRNN.java in dl4j-examples, and generated the following results: Examples labeled as 0 classified by model as 0: 1752 timesExamples labeled as 0 classified by model as 1: 148 timesExamples labeled as 1 classified by model as 0: 208 timesExamples labeled as 1 classified by model as 1: 1692 times==========================Scores======================================== Accuracy:        0.9063 Precision:       0.9067 Recall:          0.9063F1 Score:        0.9065 it seems that the precision and the recall values are not correct

solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: I want to change the encoding and add preprocessing for a specific language to DL4J, Persian Language. agibsonccc: I think even if i just build DL4j-nlp, it would be enough. Honestly not sure the encoding for starters, I have to use utf-8. I tested the package and it can't recognize persian characters 
solution: it may be that when running your code from intellij on windows it stuffs its own encoding options on the command line. 

issue: You sure it supported? I checked pom files and non of them specified a utf-8 encoding in properties. I also use netBeans. I have been using it for all of my projects and i didn't have any problem. Persian is different in many ways to other languages so I have to change many language related codes treo: Thanks. I know IntelJ is recommended, I will try it out too. 
solution: as far as I have encountered it, utf-8 was fully supported. And there is no reason to put utf-8 encoding into the pom properties, as it doesn't do anything about the capabilities of the java String.class... The only reason why you would see problem is if your jvm for some reason uses a wrong default encoding for strings... and that is controlled by a command line parameter which defaults to utf-8. 

issue: What does your "file.encoding" property contain at runtime? 
solution: 

issue: Does the DL4J library have support for FCNs ala the Long et al paper for hotmap image segmentation? Like adding skips, etc...?  [<-LINK->] It's pretty popular heh So, the tricks they apply, like skip layer fusion, how would one replicate that in DL4J?

solution: 

issue: ptah23: you're having a really weird issue here.. I'm pretty sure there's something installed on your machine that is causing the wrong library to get loaded 
solution: 

issue: Can any1 plz share a pom.xml for a project in which they used DL4j? my IntelliJ gives me an error that it can't find deeplearning4j-nlp v:0.7.2..... 
solution: 

issue: I'm trying to find the issue but even though I enabled debug logging, I don't get any message ok, give me a sec raver120: here is my code, [<-LINK->] it's identical to the example except file do you anything need else? 
solution: by system specs i mean: os, cpu, physical ram amount. 

issue: as for your "jpeg libraries" that are failing to load from what I\'m assuming is your github issue? java cv just uses opencv under the hood - you may have corrupt images maybe? 
solution: no, the deep learning ami from amazon has everything you need for python including cuda, except the linux jpeg library is not compatible with dl4j. 

issue: ptah23: please provide a complete project with source files, resources (image files), pom.xml file,everything, that should work but doesn't and I'll try it here ptah23: BTW, libjpeg is linked statically in both OpenCV and Leptonica, they can't be affected by whatever is installed on the system. The only thing that can affect that is if you're trying to use a custom version of OpenCV or Leptonica. So, again, please provide a complete project that isn't working and we'll find a way to make it work

issue: Hi. I'm new to DL4J and have been trying out the examples. I built a stacked RBM network (by dropping the decoder layers from the DeeepAutoencoderExample and using  softmax in the output layer) for classifying MNIST data but it looks like the configuration is not quite right. I have pretrain and backprop set to true ( [<-LINK->] ).  When I try to train it I get a DL4JInvaliInputException: Labels array numColumns (size(1) = 784) does not match output layer number of outputs (nOut = 10).  What am I missing?

solution: )) yeah right! I am trying to do some segmentation, but specific one, for PDF documents (locate graphs, formulas, tables etc).. 

issue: If it should be based on the last few days, a time series with a RNN would probably work best There's a lot of info on the dl4j site on RNNs 
solution: 

issue: autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model can be used for such purposes. It basically forecasts the the time series. Though i am not very sure about its java implementation, a python implementation is quite easy to use. 
solution: just a collection of ordered step values. 

issue: raver119: sorry mate it was about 3am and I crashed thanks for replying. I'm thinking I missed a compile on a file actually. I ran it clean after and I got the log entries. my corpus is about 63000 documents. I have been experimenting w different settings. Is 63000 considered small or large to you?

issue: dwr-psandhu: what would you try to achieve with it? RNN without LSTM kind of stops being RNN I suspect it would become just CNN 
solution: 

issue: I am trying to model the relationship Y(t) = 10.16 + 0.945*Y(t-1) – 1.487log(X(t))  where Y(t) is target at time t and X(t) is input at time t. The relationship is simple but while using RNN with LSTM even with a single neuron gives decent results it is not as smooth as the relationship above.  [<-LINK->] 
solution: I guess I am struggling with why the RNN with LSTM with the input as provided not be able to reproduce this simple relationship. It does a decent job but is very noisy as you can see from the figure above.

solution: 

issue: Quick help here: When I train with a certain number of batches, how do I reset the batches dimension so that when I do testing with just one batch it doesn't give a dimension error? e.g. train with rnn inputshape [batches, inputsize, timelength] = (5,2,4). I train it, and then later wish to evaluate with rnnTimeStep with input shape [1,2,1], i.e. one example, 2 inputshape, 1 timestamp it gives an error if I previously trained with a different batch size. I think I recall hearing that it allocates the batchsize to the first input batchsize sure one sec 
solution: There is a setOutput stuck in there at line34. Ah I see what you mean though. So when manually scoring I should set the input if the batch size changes. I came across this before but forgot about inputs sets to null in rnn step. Thanks!. 

issue: tamaex: you might want to explain "customize". Do you mean train a model starting from wikipedia? For that kind of data you are better off building your own model from scratch wikipedia doesn't correlate well with real business data

issue: So.. I'm creating an NDArray for an RNN. I want x examples per time step. what if I can't fill that last time step with enough examples? So.. What if I my time step has 10 examples but I have a total number of  17 examples? the last time step then has only 7 examples? I'm trying to imagine what the matrix would look like in that case or rather how I would have to initialize my NDArray 
solution: agibsonccc: yes, this page is always open on my 2nd monitor the last couple days (more like weeks tbh). Having some abstract code to go along with it would be immensely helpful. Like.. If you have 17 examples and you want 10 examples per time step, this is how you initialize the array and then this is how you set the values. 

issue: So that page explains how the shapes work numExamples,inputSize,timeSeriesLength] numExamples is batch size inputSize is columns or observations the last dimension is the time series length 
solution: 

issue: input here is more like "feature". If you are collecting data from one sensor you have one input size, more two sensors two input size etc. teh-mICON: in that case yes feature size would be 3. number of examples would be seven if each day served as a minibatch And if you were collecting data every hour the time series length would be 24 So 7,3,24

solution: 

issue: hi, if i want to pretrain the DBN and finetune with labels, should i simpily stacked RBMs with OutputLayer and enable pretrain and backprop? 
solution: as for the activations, if you read more closely you will notice dl4j doesn\'t have "activation layers". if you want to use raw rbm output then just specify identity for the activation function. 

issue: I got below error when train the dataset on local spark: NEP error any idea? 
solution: I deleted your post. Please use gist next time.. 

issue: OK, I think I know what happens. The flow is that SubsetVertexipSubset(alsophoneSubset) outputs values into an embedding layer, and eventually it (ipSubset) has adoBackwardmethod that's being called although the backpropagation does not need to go back toipSubset, but rather stop at the EmbeddingLayer level, right? 
solution: It's being called by executing net.fit().

solution: navado: as a bonus, if you build from source and are using CPU (not GPU) you can compile for your processor and get AVX support. 

issue: and are you running from command line or IntelliJ? 
solution: if you're running from IntelliJ, I believe you'll need to enable a specific profile. usually underMaven Projectson the IntelliJ right-hand sidebar. 

issue: navado: I don't have much to add on gradient checks other than what's already been mentioned (tanh, etc). A lot of the other things (lr=1.0 or Updater.NONE) should be picked up by the gradient check util if set incorrectlyalso I don't think anyone has mentioned double precision as being necessary (it's critical for gradinet checks)otherwise we've got a lot of gradient checks in the unit testsif you still can't work it out ping me again and I'll take a look

issue: liyupengsummer: yes, it's the value of the cost/loss function (average over example in minibatch), including any l1/l2 regularization components vincenzocaselli: basically: you can do what you want in a (custom) layer but no, we haven't implemented that (though to be fair, it came out today? :P) the results in the paper look interesting though - if the results hold up to scrutiny, I can't see a reason why we wouldn't consider adding it in the future we don't tend to jump on things right away though 
solution: 

issue: hi, i spent days tying to visualize something with your BHT-Sne implementation, now i tested the reference implementation and the results are awesome and it does it in a few minutes instead of doing nothing in hours/days raver119, if it is helpful i can file another issue with a direct comparison to the reference implementation? (later then) (in case that the general functionality is not covered by an issue yet ;-) ) 
solution: would it not be simpler to write an wrapper for the c++ reference? there are already several wrapper for different languages [<-LINK->] and the reference works pretty well. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Does anyone know why this is the case for CNN->RNN networks using BPTT?And what do I do about it, add a preprocessor? Are you suggesting that I file an issue on Github or is it a functionality in the chat?

solution: 

issue: basically you need enough examples and large enough layers... architecturally GPUs and CPUs are quite different in how they deal with parallelismnot everything is going to be faster on a GPU, depending on data dimensions 
solution: my use case is multiple smaller models using LSTM, running in parallel - probably with each model called from a separate java instance. Will each model be pushed and able to run in parallel on the GPU, using up parallelism of the GPU in that way? i.e. multiple models running simultaneously on the GPU?. 

issue: so rl4j: currently you have to build all the dl4j related dependencies by hand as it depends on SNAPSHOT right? from the pom:) <nd4j.version>0.7.3-SNAPSHOT</nd4j.version><dl4j.version>0.7.3-SNAPSHOT</dl4j.version> 
solution: 

issue: ptah23: not sure where you got that from? :D Depends what version you want to use 0.7.2 no java doesn't work like that my friend master of course is tied to the master version of dl4j :D rl4j 0.7.2 depends on dl4j 0.7.2 
solution: 

issue: so just to make sure i am on the right track: 0.7.2 is on github branch intropro072 right? 
solution: ptah23: hmm no just don't do that please. sbt. there's no reason to build from source. 

issue: quick question, if I've trained a net to regress with the identity function one variable that can be either 0 or 1, and I get out floats between 0.1 and 1.9, is this the expected outcome? Also,  I'm thinking that these are probabilities, then am I reading it correctly if I think below 0.9 or so is a 0 and above 1.1 is a 1? I'm messing about with the last part, this was just my initial guess 
solution: hm  that sounds like a tuning problem then. I am working on that, but it takes time to compute.  are you saying the spread between the numbers is too wide?. 

issue: Hi everyone!I\'m trying implement a neural net to interpret handwritten numbers. For this work I\'ve used the example in dl4j-examples.

solution: 

issue: okay guys I'm reading notes thank you so much and sorry for silly questions. I'll improve myself 
solution: 

issue: I have an application that needs to use vectors from a word2vec model. I'm not sure, but this application may benefit from using the GPU. However, when I set the backend to use cuda it takes forever to load the model. It's been 20 minutes so far when it's usually about 20-30 seconds with the CPU backend. Is this expected? 
solution: you're loading a gigantic embedding in to the gpu. 

issue: On a separate note, I'm working on a different many-to-one problem that has different length sequences within a batch. My understanding for many-to-one problems of the same length is that you do not need a mask for the features and if the sequence length is say 5 you need a labels mask that looks like [0 0 0 0 1]. However let's say for my case the maximum length sequence is 5, but the current sequence is only 3, I think  I need a features mask like [1 1 1 0 0]. Now, for the labels mask do I want it like (a) [0 0 1 0 0] or (b) [0 0 0  0 1]? 
solution: 

issue: hi, is there any method to shuffle the data from DataIterator? 
solution: liyupengsummer: you can shuffle individual examples within DataSet. but shuffling hypothetically endless DataSetIterator is totally different story :). 

issue: GravesLSTMCharModellingExample is training with 42.0 in average iteration score. My character embedding size is 300, and number of characters in vocabulary is 97, language Turkish Is it expected or is there something else I have to do in the code...

issue: hmmm does a single-layer perceptron have only one hidden layer, and a multilayer one, 2..* hidden layers ? that\'s not clear (I already ready lot of articles/"tutorials" about it) perhaps this is an idiot question ahha:p 
solution: I think you treat a perceptron is like an individual neuron, with no internal layers.. 

issue: so it defines if a weight on a neuron can increment/decrement a lot or just a little ? thus, it defines the neurons' weight's resiliency ? resilience* 
solution: Yeah, it does this by effectively changing the shape of the learning curve. 

issue: You basically get an error for the input signals to the network and the output signals generated, for a neuron-by-neuron basis You can use the learning rate to scale just how much of an impact the error is going to have So if you expect a certain output, and you get another, the difference between the two can be used to infer how to train a particular neuron But if you're not selective with the learning rate, this error will have either a huge impact in training a neuron or nothing at all 
solution:

solution: So you can pass 1.0s and 0.0s (doubles, but still a binary representation) and they'll in turn become 0.3948934s etc..

I'm guessing you didn't setup the uber jar right There's not that much to it though o_0 you should just need the maven-shade-plugin and nd4j-native-platform specified as a dependency you seem to be filtering out things you shouldn't be Can I look at the dl4j relevant parts of your pom? Your stack trace tells me otherwise Let me see your pom !gist of course We use META-INF/services and the java service loader for nd4j I"m guessing you did something like META-INF/* as a filter Let me see your pom Just of note you don't need the UI :D [<-LINK->] err I hate you can't link lines in gitter you can get rid of the UI dep in your pom you can get rid of jfreecharts and a lot of the other stuff in there 
solution: 

issue: mindcrime: can you try adding the transformers from here to your shade config? [<-LINK->] I'm wondering if that's necessary for the service loader to work properly 
solution: I figured it was the shade plugin some how :D.

issue: Hi everyone! Could anyone explain me the syntax of BaseAggregate or AggregateSkipGram, I am trying to modify the objective function for the Word2Vec algorithm? Thank you! agibsonccc: Thanks, filed the Issue ( [<-ISSUE->] )! 
solution: 

issue: Hi, is there an example showing how to use ComputationGraph to build a net, e.g., cnn? Thanks a lot, I'll have a look.@AlexDBlack Great, thanks.@AlexDBlack BTW, when will the version 0.8.0 be released? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: I did not know that [<-LINK->] is a random stuff, since it appears to be the same as [<-LINK->] .But thank you for your help! 
solution: As for the link you just sent out that's actually just documentation rot.

solution: i clrearly see it. 

issue: The thing is I followed your recommendations and used DM isntead of DBOW .. trying to fine tune parameters...but I dont get as good clusters as what I get using DBOW.. 
solution: yeap.. it is a bit faster..in the case I use DBOW, I cannot use "infervectors" as I always get same vector..or should I increase number of iterations?. 

issue: hi@raver119.. sure.. I fill an issue with source code and vectors.. ;) when is that? ;) 
solution: 

issue: Hello! Is there any chance that A3C would be finished? I am now trying to add a workaround to be able to save the trained A3C model... 
solution: denni2007: If you suspect either a DL4J bug (unlikely) or an error in your code (more likely) might be culprit, then you’ll need to provide us with more detail about your task and data, an explanation of what “totally incorrect” means, and ideally a gist of your source code.. 

issue: Hi@raver119.. I confirm. I get expected infer vectors when using DM model (1 Epoch, 5 Iterations, ..) but not with DBOW. I always get the same result.. I open an issue..I include the code I m using to perform the testThanks in advance for having a look to it ;) I fill this issue: [<-ISSUE->] @raver119, let me know if you need anything else to debug it ;-) 
solution: show full output please. 

issue: hmm. what reasons could there be for inputs not activating?  I'm noticing a pattern of input activations going up and down nicely for two thousand iteration blocks, then the third one doesn't activate the inputs, so the models layer two goes in to a death spiral. on the log10 deviations scale the inputs drop from 1.0 to -1.0, and the it goes completely flat. in the next 1000 iteration block it shows life again.  I think this is not a data problem. "it" input activations go flat. sure, moment.  [<-LINK->] the bit between 2000 iterations and 3000 iterations on the deviations log10, green line is input 
solution: 

issue: Sorry, I was banned from newbie room, so I am trying to ask here: are there any examples in DL4j which demonstrates anything outstanding, anything that simple 2 layer networks can't do? 
solution: no, problem is how you’re asking for this.. 

issue: I built all the examples successfully but when I am running using runallexamples.sh, I am getting Error: Could not find or load main class Any clues ? RobAltena: How do I run dative examples ?

issue: hi all, who can give link to full example of DBN? (with evaluating) agibsonccc: im looking for something like that [<-LINK->] , but with correct output of evaluating 
solution: It's not much different from a multi layer perceptron. 

issue: Why not? data and seed and updater should be the same. 
solution: and second one was used 2 times.. 

issue: Hello. I'm trying to import a model from ssd ( [<-LINK->] ) Keras and facing a problem. In dl4j no AtrousConvolution2D. Will you implement it or is there some way to replace it with something that is already implemented? Replacement to Convolution2D does not help because Network starts worse identify objects. And one small question. When you move  dl4j 0.7.3 to mvnrepository? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, CSVExample uses model.fit(DataSet), I want to use model.fit(DataSetIterator). How should I create a DataSetIterator that iterates on a given DataSet? agibsonccc: You'r right. But my data set is as CSV file as well. So I'm modifing  that example. My question is that how I must define a DataSetIterator on a given DataSet. Thanks. 
solution: 

issue: How can I hide "Hit termination condition on iteration " message from being displayed at the console ... or better send it to some log file? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: : If I have 2 minibatches, one containing AB and other containing CD and if I set iteration=2 and epoch=3, it would be (A-A-B-B-C-C-D-D)(A-A-B-B-C-C-D-D)(A-A-B-B-C-C-D-D), right?

issue: is it possible to manually change learning rate between batches? can't find aset_learningrate()onmodelorupdateris there some documentation on it? eraly: i was looking for a way to set it on the entire model, but if it is only possible on a per layer basis i will use that. 
solution: 

issue: MaMiFreak: Yes, you can. It's not exactly straightforward. You want to set it on the entire model, not on a per layer basis? 
solution: 

issue: I have a LOT of data that I want to feed to my network (an RNN). Can I just call .fit with several DataSets one after the other instead of one enormous DataSet? 
solution: So.. How should I approach this then if I sometimes have ~ 1000 data points per day and sometimes just 800?. 

issue: WolfeeTJ: we have that in our enterprise version, the problem you are describing is a bit hard reason being: what is a "model"? what kind of "data" are you hitting it with? the right way to do "production rest api" will vary by data type Not to mention needing to setup the pre processing pipeline the right way What kind of stack are you using? I could give you some hints on how to do it with various frameworks like spring,play,.. the great thing about this being in java..is there's not much to really do since everything is in java already :D rohrl: how are you trying to build? what does "fails" mean though? Do you have a stack trace I can see? did you follow the windows guide on libnd4j? whatever you are describinglikelyisn't the root cause  [<-LINK->] follow this

issue: Hi. I'm trying to do some classification of news articles and used the net from the Word2VecSentimentRNN tutorial. I went use 40000 examples in 5 epochs and I still can't get any reasonable results. I played around with batch sizes and observed that a batch size of 1 was best (at least after around 1500 iterations).Any ideas? 
solution: 

issue: all in all I have 15 classes. I'm training multiple one-vs.-many  or many-vs-many classifiers, following the selection strategies surveyed in Silla, Freitas: A Survey of Hierarchical Classification http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.183.302&rep=rep1&type=pdfExample classes would be (inclusive strategy in the paper):Positive:Threaten unconventional attackNegative:Threaten conventional attack &Threaten with military force &ThreatenScreenshot doesn't really make sense, but I can tell you that score went down to ~0.04 in early iterations, went up to ~1.15 around iteration 50,000 and down again to ~0.55 at iteration 100,000. 
solution: well I\'m planning to train a whole tree of classifiers to be able to distinguish the 15 classes. Each net should be able to tell if an example belongs to the class or not.During evaluation an example is passed through the tree and follows the "true" path.. 

issue: Hi for everyone! I'm programming my neural net with MNIST database and I want to persist my own images using  the MNIST pattern. Someone knows how can I do this using Java or else if exist some framework that do this job for me.Thanks in advance! agibsonccc: Sorry, but, do you have this link where I can follow, because I can't access the youtube from my company raver120: and@agibsonccctks i'll try in this way 
solution: 

issue: vincentbohlen: just run through 1000 iterations, and do evaluation. just to get idea what you actually have i'm speaking exactly about f1, not score because you might have overfit actually we've saw that before 
solution: 

issue: uh, didn't expect that. okay. Guess that will take some time.Is there a way to stop the training after 1000 iterations? With the EarlyStoppingTrainer or something? 
solution: and right in that loop do evaluation every, say 300, iterations. 

issue: Is there a method to get the filters from a convolutionLayer? 
solution: guilhermeperin: check out ConvolutionalIterationListener internals. raver119: I didn't find the filter information in ConvolutionalIterationListener class. I would like to know which patterns my CNN is extracting from data and computing convolution with data. However, I don't see any method which can give me this filters.. 

issue: i'm sorry, all you have is 400 examples in total, and it's split as 370/30? am i getting this right? 
solution: that\'s "slightly" below usual amounts of data... esp for second class..

I'd recommend the following:!book (see below), [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: pwlam09: could you give us a !igist of a pom? and yet 90% of papers use a variant of SGD :D there's gotta be a reason for that ^^ 
solution: 

issue: and what is your goal? a single classification for the entire window? or a classification for each time step within the window? 
solution: if you want global pooling (which is one way to do it - and necessary, if you wanted variable length windows) you'll have to wait until the next release (we're working on getting it out soonish)for cnns + dense layers only: that should work fineas for importing data: CNN data from CSVs isn't something that's especially easy right nowone option: flatten it to a 1d row vector format (like MNIST, if you are familiar with the data the MnistRecordReader produces), one record per row. append the label to the end of each row, then it's basically just like csv example (already linked by@grayhaired) plus the setInputType from here: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: L-M is also used for deep learning. I wonder why you have such information. For example new effective cascade architectures: Kalinovskii I. A.

issue: Still no luck in calling similarity on W2V...I've tried to call it right after W2V model creation and it works. But if I save it and reload it then similarity just doesn't work.. 
solution: raver119: Yes you are right:). 

issue: This morning I've asked you for help because Im not able to use similarity. You linked me a code grom git saying I had to implement a check for looking if a word is in the vocab. As I've already said there's no need to check the presence of the word because I get the labels from a file that is created straight from the vectors model. So my question was: why do I keep getting a nullPointer? Because this is what I do:create vectors\nsave model with Writeword2VecModel\nI reload the model with ReadWord2VecModel\nas soon as I try to call the similarity method on two vectors I get the nullpointerexcThe fact is that those words ARE in the vectors. I take the labels inside the for loop straight from a file created during the vector creation. So I've really no idea why I get that Exc.forget my stub, just forget it haha 
solution: 

issue: raver119: I want to classify around 4 labels in ear recogi raver119: I want to classify around 2 labels in ear recognition problem like gender(male, female),occlusion(none, severe,mild). So how can I do this using can or rnn? cnn*

issue: Hello, I am having some issues getting the DL4j GPU capability set up. I have changed the backend to Cuda-8.0. I  have it installed correctly because it works with Tensorflow. However, I keep on getting the error "CUDA backend can\'t find NVCC within PATH environment variable." Any help would be greatly appreciated I'm not entirely sure. I have the Cuda library in my zshrc file. Is that what you mean? 
solution: 

issue: JHousmanEdi: can the JVM actually see NVCC on the system path environment variable? System.out.println(System.getenv("PATH")); see if  the output of that actually lists the cuda directory that contains nvcc for example, C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v8.0\\bin on windows 
solution: 

issue: Are there any another jars that I need to pull in? Anything I need to do to initialize a backend? Spark 2.1, and gradle not sbt :(

solution: sjsy: the only "changes entirely between iterations" behaviour is subsampling (i.e., it\'ll show every 2nd or 4th or 8th point, as you get more and more data)that\'s to avoid sending and processing too much to the front end.

issue: Hi,  is it possible to do a multi-label classification in dl4j? If not, any ideas in what direction I should look to solve such a problem? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: that medium post@turambarsent earlier had something similar...it included a beginners guide w/ command line for setting up qrnn might be a better idea to encourage some peeps to blog about setting up their environments, using cloud commands, etc. I can also put something on my blog

solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: Hello, I would like to know how I can optimize Word2VectSentimentRNN example to work in 1 or 2 GB memory?I tried to run but it throws memoryOutOfIndex exception.It requires 7 GB atleast. But how do I optimize it to work within 2 GB if it is possible at all.kindly help me. It is a biit challenging.. I suppose.

issue: Hi, how should I cite your library in my phd paper oh..I found 
solution: xywen4buct: You arevastlyoverthinking this. 

issue: raver119: Let's take this conversation to gitter. I looked at the code some more starting with EpsTermination. How do you do this here? 
solution: 

issue: Guys, I am looking to a way to disable ND4J from use multiple GPU's. Looks like I can set CudaEnvironment.getInstance().getConfiguration().allowMultiGPU(false). However, I could not find CudaEnvironment in any library. The path should be org.nd4j.jita.... But there is no jita in my repository. I have these two lines in my Build.sbt <<"org.nd4j" % "nd4j-cuda-8.0" % "0.7.2">> and <<"org.nd4j" % "nd4j-cuda-8.0-platform" % "0.7.2">>@agibsonccc 
solution: I have set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 in my .bashrc on ubuntu and sourced from it. When starting nd4j, I notices that BasicContextPool were creating new stream for thread xxx to both GPU devices. Lookes like CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES did not work?. 

issue: I can't seem to get weighted looss functions working on arbiter are they suported? 
solution: 

issue: To make it clear, am I supposed to add both of "org.nd4j" % "nd4j-native-platform" % "0.7.2""org.nd4j" % "nd4j-cuda-8.0-platform" % "0.7.2" when I am using CUDA? 
solution: 

issue: rawkintrevo: sorry to ask you this but do you think you could file an !issue with this sometime later on? Documenting notebooks is something we should do 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: haven't even gotten cuDNN up and running yet. Not to mention@raver119and I found a malloc bottleneck special to my case. Will be burning silicon once we get those out of the way 
solution: now you've faced that reason :). 

issue: so let me see if i get this straight: you’ve got a CSV with data for N images. The first K rows have only labels data (N labels, one per image, per row) for K classes? and then actual image data begins on row K+1? but are your images all the same size or not? 
solution: Man, as far as I can tell, you are using a really unusual format for storing your images. 

issue: hi. what there supposed to be in place of the arch in the command: ./buildnativeoperations.sh -c cuda -сс YOUR_DEVICE_ARCH I would like to build native cpu and cuda 8.0 backend 
solution: vlovsky: no params for cpu. you could just do no params and let it build for all though (this takes a while though). 

issue: agibsonccc: @turambar, The columns are different sensors and the rows are raw data (power) that those sensors are reading sequentially, I am trying to treat it like an image because it is really just patterns that I`m trying to detect 
solution: 

issue: There\'s prob a simple answer. this is error: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid input: expect output columns must be equal to rows 28 x columns 28 x channels 1 but was instead [97, 4]. i.e. seems like a mismatch between square format and flat I imagine there's a munging function. Will paste gist.  [<-LINK->] . 
solution: 

issue: not 784. Do I need to change that 28,28 to match the length each training sample byte array? 
solution: 

issue: hi. When trying to work with the DL4J sources, IDEA doesn't recognize getters/setters. Can someone help? 
solution: 

issue: are you using cpu backend or gpu backend? 10 minutes to load vectors sounds either as ram issue, or gpu backend so i’m asking what you’re using there

issue: hi, I cannot install ND4J, I have a lot of errors in my pom.xml files, someone can help me ? Ok I find an answer in the [<-LINK->] , thank you 
solution: I mean no offense here but what you\'re asking is the equivalent of: "Can I magically make my neural net train instantly? I have a computer with 3GB of RAM from the 90s".

issue: Hi+ It's a greap library. From the documentation, I couln't manage one of my problems. 
solution: I mean one dimension ndarray to double[]. 

issue: hi. anyone can comment on the fix for [<-ISSUE->] ? 
solution: 

issue: I just filed an issue for DL4J [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: wait what o_0 We do 3d images? It's just channels :D It would just be datavec right? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: adam, it looks like my issue with later versions of nd4j is caused by statements like X.get(INDArrayIndex...).assign(INDArray) used in parallel streams, even if different substreams write to mutually exclusive indices of X. Is get().assign() thread-safe? 
solution: in general: INDArray ops are not thread safeyou might expect mutually exclusive indices toprobablywork on CPU (especially if subsets are not overlapping, instead of independent contiguous blocks) - but definitely not on CUDA. 

issue: AlexDBlack: thank you for the quick reply. To clarify, the number of outputs in my neural network = number of pixels in image (it is supposed to output a binary mask), implementing my own PathLabelGenerator won't work because the ImageRecordReader still expects a String. 
solution: 

issue: lordoftheflies: for containers, we usually need to get classes using JNI loaded with a special shared class loader, that's not specific to JavaCPP 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys, I'm having trouble understanding what the labels are in this example [<-LINK->] I can see there is a directory for training labels and there is a directory for testing labels, but how do those manifest, is it files with the same name as the data they refer to and inside those csv files, there is only one thing, the label? 
solution: 

issue: if you want to use the new version of dl4j/nd4j etc: wait like 5 minutes :) I'll be updating the examples soon 
solution: raver119: @AlexDBlackSo i just need to wait for the update of the examples? It's not an issue with dl4j?. 

issue: Hi ..I run the word2vecSentimentRNN now, i dint do any save/load model. Just run the example code, it took 2 hours  and i see the probability result for positive review data is  positive value: 0.04 & negative is 0.95.  Where  i am going wrong or what is going wrong ? raver119: ^^^ 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: so can we try 0.8 from mvn now? 
solution: I made a typo. That program should have produced an exception (in my opinion) but it runs successfully.. So, how could I do per-dimension addition. 

issue: Hi!Im getting this errors o.deeplearning4j.plot.BarnesHutTsne - Error at iteration when running  your tsne example. Im going to save the cordinates to a cvs file. 
solution: 

issue: What profiling would be useful in this situation? I'm not really accustomed to debugging gpu related issues. Does it make sense to inspect the situation with jvisualvm? 
solution: 

issue: I wonder if I can prod someone for some knowledge about how to condition a RNN for multiple types of data? Oh yes - I've been reading a lot ;) super impressed by this tool - just outgrown Simbrain 
solution: wmeddie: I tried a lot of approaches, the entire set, small subsets of 30k or even 1k lines, I'm fine with overfitting but couldn't achieve even that. 

issue: Hi, regarding the GPU again. :)I removed the "CudaEnvironment.getInstance().getConfiguration().allowMultiGPU(true);" from the main class but when I run the nvidia-smi command I see that only 1 GPU is beeing utilized: screen-shot (and I have 2x NVIDIA Tesla P100 at my disposal).Also, the GPU utilization of the used one gets max of 23%. Is there a way to get even more performance out of it? :) I did not consider using the ParallelWrapper class yet, though If it makes any difference 
solution: If you haven't already checkout the cuda-specific example in the example repo.. 

issue: Have you tried fiddling with the minibatch size?  Maybe a smaller one? Have you tried similar parameters to this: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Hi together, is anyone of you familiar with this exception:  Exception in thread "AsyncIterator thread" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.datavec.api.records.reader.RecordReader.next()Ljava/util/List;  I\'m trying to get this tutorial up and running: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: lol why in the new version changed from locations from BaseInputSplit to list and translating it? :D Now I have to rewrite my custom split :D 
solution: 

issue: Is it possible to run Arbiter with generating and evaluating multiple candidate configurations in parallel? hmm wait, but every time I ran Arbiter it would generate 1 candidate configuration, train/evaluate it in parallel and after it is finished with it the next one would generated i.e., sequential candidate generation and eval or did I miss somethin? O_o 
solution: For instance, if I need 1 hour to train/evaluate a give candidate configuration, and I setup Arbiter to run for 6 hours -> it will generate and test only 6 configurations.This was ok when I was using CPU as the processing power was used to the max. :)But now while playing with the GPU I noticed that 1 gpu unit is not utilized to 100% (maybe 23% or 33% max for my case/datasets).Letting Arbiter generate and evaluate candidates in parallel would potentially allow here for an even better performance.. 

issue: I just updated my tutorial on setting up eclipse project without Maven to 0.8.0 and I'm getting an odd error, what were the changes to ND4J?  at org.nd4j.jita.concurrency.CudaAffinityManager.getNumberOfDevices(CudaAffinityManager.java:173) I'm looking at the POM and nothing really stands out, was there a new dependency added to ND4J 0.8? 
solution: 

issue: i run MuntiGpuLenetMnistExample and during training there is message: o.n.j.h.i.CudaZeroHandler - Out of [DEVICE] memory, host memory will be used instead: deviceId: [0], requested bytes: [200704]/ why did it happend? 
solution: 

issue: Sorry for longer and repeated question.I changed a bit my method but still compiler has a problem with .layer() function. But I would like to have control over each individual layer. In future I am planning to add some more options so for now it could seems like it is not necessary to do what I do.I changed NeuralNetConfiguration.ListBuilder config to MultiLayerConfiguration.Builder config.  When I had there NNC.ListBuilder it fails to build it with exception: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Invalid configuration: layer number 1 not specified. Expect layer numbers to be 0 to 1 inclusive (number of layers defined: 2)Here is my code snippet: https://gist.github.com/papperwing/d4fd193e739616810faec48941f173fcThe 'for' there is important to notice.I did not found any similar snippet code in examples.Thanks for your answer. 
solution: 

issue: anyone knows what output, input mask and output mask are when printing out a dataset? I feel like it's obvious but I'm just tired... 
solution: 

issue: How to use similarity() method in word2vec? raver119: If I have an external file of words? raver119: and those words are not in the corpus? 
solution: illuminati11: by definition you're not going to get a good result. 

issue: So I have all of my data in a 3d INDArray.  Is there a data set iterator interface for that? 
solution: There's often some sort of domain associated with an ndarray. I've used RNNs in dl4j a lot, I'm just trying to streamline my process instead of gathering data in CSVs and loading them. 

issue: raver119: I want to just compute similarity between words, just like WORNET does. I am little bit confused. 
solution: in other words: you CAN compare words that exist in word2vec vocabulary. if they are missing - you can just skip them. 

issue: Is there any planned changes to ImageInputSplit? I am completely rewriting behaviour of reading files for my diploma thesis. When I finish it I could send you merge request, if you wish :) 
solution: 

issue: is there an example I could look at? I'm struggling to determine how to even get started implementing my own recordReader 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys, why could it be that fitting a datasetiterator  for normalization gives me a noSuchElementException error.normalizer.fit(trainDataIter); 
solution: 

issue: are there release notes for 0.8.0? 
solution: in the process of compilation. working on that. lots of changes. tons of stuff. 

issue: clearly! But I have to trust my eyes and very simple code that prints probabilities and samples in that specific place. 
solution: 

issue: any reason the TicTacToe example doesn't work out of the box via runexamples.sh? main classes 1 through 13 seem to work fine. dykens: I use code compiled via maven and the provided script. so I just enter '14' for example number 14. can't type anything wrong. dykens: but you're right :) script uses capitals in package name. 
solution: but for nd4j op that parameter means probability of success for each attempt. 

issue: Anyone else had trouble with mvn clean install on version 0.8.0? Says there's an error in pom 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: while you're at it your runexamples.sh hack runs into trouble when source folder names use capital letters. since you're converting the folder names to package structures 
solution: 

issue: so it looks like ListStringRecordReader is actually just what I need 
solution: well, fix… new op.. single probability per index. 

issue: Thank@raver119...  I am up an running 
solution: cool :). 

issue: agibsonccc: gpu support has been merged to kubernetes master [<-ISSUE->] yey! :) time to compare performance 
solution: would be interesting to compare. 

issue: Hi, i'm using dl4j version 0.7.1 for time series regression in spark. On my notebooks works fine, on my cluster the score is always 0. The cluster has 14 executors with 2 cores each. Because the data and all configuration are the same in local and on the server, where might be the problem? 
solution: In local with same data and conf the score is fine. On cluster. 

issue: Hi there - can anyone point me in the direction of an example of the WaveFileReader being used? Ah right - just not a functional part of ML4J yet? I could encode in an image matrix or plain ol' text, I suppose :) wait - so it does work, just no examples? ahhh okay - I'll get back to head bashing cheers 
solution: 

issue: Hi, there are compile errors in latest code of dl4j-examples 0.8,examples/transferlearning/vgg16 package: log not defined this is one example, /dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/transferlearning/vgg16/FitFromFeaturized.java actually, all examples in transferlearning.vgg16 package have same problem, log not defined 
solution: 

issue: hi there. module nd4j-jackson-reflectionloader still has 0.7.3-SNAPSHOT 
solution: 

issue: -bash: maven: command not found 
solution: agibsonccc: , should I be using a record reader or a file reader to get at the contents of the file?. You don't typically use a filerecord reader directly. audio and CSV, currently. 

issue: Orpheuz: that depends on what you do. But for now my first suspect would be UI. Do you have UI listeners attached? UI slowing things down is  known issue, and we work on general solution there. but for now it’s a problem. 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: pursuing the issue with non-deterministic results with nd4j 0.7.2 -- the problem still persists... there are a lot of posts related to non-determinism of openmp/mkl when multiple threads are used. Somehow, the small roundoff errors are leading to an instability in my calculation. How can I set OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 for Nd4jBlas operations? does it get it from the environment variables or JVM system props? thank you! 
solution: chunyu66: hmm lstms might be the way to go then. When we did autoencoders it was to flag things. 

issue: Hey guys, I've been getting this NoSuchElementException when using normalizer.fit(trainDataIter) !gits !gist What could it be, a wrong path or something? 
solution: Largely based on the 1D conv net example from Dave Kale. 

issue: could anyone help me with this error "Intel MKL FATAL ERROR: Cannot load mkl_intel_thread.dll." ? 
solution: well, you've got an installation of MKL on your system path, that ND4J is trying to link to (for example: an anaconda install)however, it seems like the MKL install isn't correct/functional. 

issue: Hey guys, what is the size of a inputTypeRecurrent [<-LINK->] I can't find the source code for it on github. oak-tree: There's a video about Keras imports, hope this helps :  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Did Spark 2 support land in 0.8? 
solution: For now GC issue is really pressing though I have half of my VRAM free. 

issue: rkfg: beyond the GC stuff that@raver119will add, poor performance with lots of small objects is a known issue (due to extra GC time required)so if you have lots of small objects, you might try reducing the number in the JVM if you can 
solution: AlexDBlack: yes, I discovered that. Also, it's much better to reuse the arrays and don't use putScalar in a loop. There are put() methods that can fill the entire row or even a subtensor in one call, they probably work much faster with less GC overhead.. 

issue: Good day,@AlexDBlack. This is Jason, I'm an Java developer, and I'm new to deeplearning4j, and now I'm starting look into rl4j-examples, previously there is a doom which demonstrate QLearningDiscreteConv, but now it's not there anymore, is there any schedule to make another such example? 
solution: raver119: I don't know, but I can find it from previous version. I will try to make it work from my local. Thank you all the same. 

issue: JasonHao123: Welcome! Here's a link to Deeplearning4j's Gitter Guidelines, our documentation and other DeepLearning resources online. Please explore these and enjoy! [<-LINK->] 
solution: For DL4J issues, click 'New Issue' at [<-LINK->] - for ND4J, use [<-LINK->] instead. 

issue: as a beginner, I also have the same issue, it's not that easy to adjust CNN parameters to match the input and output size 
solution: it’s technically will be equal to dropout. 

issue: Najmeh-M: please make sure you’re using dl4j/nd4j 0.8.0 
solution: 

issue: Hi Derek, does the wrapper allow you to integrate DL4J with Spark MLLib pipelines? Because I would be very interested in this Especially if it is written in Scala 
solution: 

issue: Hi All,I would like to use maxout networks in my work, but I could not find it in the Activations. Can anybody help me in that issue? 
solution: 

issue: hey guys, I've tried using NormalizerStandardize for normalization (normalizer.transform(dataset)) but it seems it doesn't work... is there a normalization example that is not specific to images?  thanks 
solution: 

issue: I see@agibsoncccI went to the first link and the link for PreprocessNormalizerExample.java gives me a page not found; btw, i'm trying to normalize the features, not the labels 
solution: 

issue: I have 3 inputs and want to learn to generate 3 outputs, using an RNN. If I base my example on CompGraphLSTMExample, will it automagically just work so that the respective outputs will be trained to be similar to the respective inputs? Thanks, Adam. 
solution: I would do some more reading on how autoencoders and the like work. 

issue: agibsonccc: it's quite interesting, i printed the averages for the array resulting from dataSet.getFeatures() before and after transform, and the same for the array from dataSet.getLabels()  and the the ones for the features differ, not for the labels... 
solution: the only time label normalization comes in is regression. 

issue: Hey guys, im having trouble getting the packages imported. Im on ubuntu I cant get the DataVec prerequisite installed Is there any easy way to do this on ubuntu? oh maven has it all?? 
solution: 

issue: kingburrito666: you're not using maving or gradle? kingburrito666: maven*. with a maven or gradle the datavec dependencies will be added automatically. works fine on Ubuntu for me 
solution: so maven, gradle, sbt - everything works. 

issue: I found an apparent bug on [<-LINK->] . It says, "Imagine two matrices. One is 30x30, and another is 3x3. That is, the filter covers one-tenth of one image channel’s surface area."  But 3 times 3=9  and 30 times 30 = 900, so it covers 1%, not 10%. 
solution: 

issue: Guys, I am using CUDA backend. Is there a way in ND4J to dump the buffer of an INDArray from GPU RAM to RAM? I mean instead of call getDouble one by one 
solution: gpu/host management is handled by nd4j. 

issue: Hmm. For instance, say I have two INDArray a and b. Then I doa.get(NDArrayIndex.interval(0, 2)).assign(b)Does this trigger a sync that moves b to the part of a, on both vram and ram? I realized I have lots of this kinda operations in my code. But performance test showed it was not slow. 
solution: 

issue: There are links on the website todeeplearning4j.org/doc/orgthat are not working. E.g. [<-LINK->] has the link [<-LINK->] . I'm getting 404 error. done; [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: sonalgupta: mind filing an !issue with what you've found sonalgupta: thanks 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: yes, I got the Gym Env to work and now pretty far into a working custom MDP 
solution: 

issue: OpenBW: thank you I think it is what I want but again a problem, I want the model continue to learn in futuse use. With your example, it learns a first time and after it execute a learnt policy, but it do not continue to learn 
solution: it's reverse divide and subtract. it has the same math properties as any other element pair wise op. 

issue: vlovsky: It will throw an error for two arguments that are not the same shape 
solution: 

issue: but the problem is in "loadCartpole" it stop to train, isn\'t ? for me it execute a learnt policy but it do not continue to learn with new examples 
solution: You can resume training with setFetchable it looks like: [<-LINK->]. then call set fetchable on the mdp. 

issue: still trying to get wave files reading; am I looking at the right thing with RecordReaderDataSetIterator? Although I seem to be reading the file, I can't seem to configure it to read from the file 1 sample at a time. Any pointers? 
solution: 

issue: hmm I'd say maybe create a new record reader using the audio libraries in datavec there? there's not many docs on it but it would work in practice 
solution: 

issue: is it possible to have training loss as a score calculator to be used forScoreImprovementEpochTerminationConditioninEarlyStoppingConfiguration? reg the second question: I didn't. I am having a hard time replicating TF accuracy/training time using DL4J MLP on my dataset. Not able to figure out what's missing. It isn't drastically low but around 1-2%. I think I'm using the same parameters unless there are some other default parameters that I am not setting. 
solution: 

issue: karthikrao21: Make a significant amount of fake data at 0? On second thought that might be a bad idea. 
solution: 

issue: I have a silly metric that kinda tells whether my network is learning — the .zip size of the saved model. If it grows then probably the network complexity also rises and it becomes harder to compress it as effectively as before. Or maybe it's the opposite, it becomes more random and unpredictable... 
solution: so you’re making decisions on zip efficiency solely. Yeah, it's silly but still represents... something.. 

issue: hi guys why  my in my project DL4JTrainningUi some times  show wrong encoding for non english language 
solution: 

issue: hi@raver119, we can already get DL4J 0.8.1 ..am I right? 
solution: i see. also DL4J ... 

issue: can i input a integers/doubles  inside the nerual network that dl4j offers? dataVec support text, CSV, audio, image and video ok thanks can u send me a guide of what i can use? i am new in nerual network 
solution: start with our documentation then. 

issue: hoangtocdo90: mind filing an !issue? 
solution: however, last time i’ve checked it, it was passing.... 

issue: papperwing: if you're trying to do an intermediate representation why not just use the builder? It's a pojo like what you're looking for 
solution: 

issue: hi. mind looking into [<-ISSUE->] . I provided a few test cases to make he point. 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: : Coming back to my previous question; so I need to apply the padding and masking for each of my sentences in the input and for this, I need to know the max timestep present in my total input? how is that? Does it mean that the framework is clever enough to figure out masking on its own given my padded input and output? I have a many-to-many architecture; each sentence can be of different lengths. So, this means that I figure out the max. timesteps possible in the total input and use padding on my own? 
solution: Lets say I want to use the SequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator as discussed in Example 3 of [<-LINK->] . In that case, if my input is [I, am] and my output is [am, confused] (i.e. I want to do next word prediction at each timestep), and if I am using one-hot encoding for each word, I will need a input/output file each with 2 timesteps right? And for each timestep, I can have a CVS value (one-hot vector). Is this correct?. 

issue: agibsonccc: you advised me to use Autoencoder layers in order to build a simple denoising autoencoder. I don't want any supervised step at the end of the network, I just want it for feature reduction but with just one AE layer I can't use backpropagation since there is no output layer. 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: Here's the gist of the network configuration I'm playing with: [<-LINK->] it's along the lines of an example. please let me know if you see anything wrong I don't wanna drop out too much. it's the same configuration for which the TF model seems to work for my problem from the documentationDropout. Value is probability of retaining an activation - thus 1.0 is equivalent to no dropout. 
solution: 

issue: sonalgupta: Are you looking at the model score? Are you just looking at the model score to tell performance or running on a test set?@sonalgupta I have to double check the code but we might not average the score (i.e. not divide by batch size) 
solution: sonalgupta: File an !issue with more detail. Thanks.. 

issue: Oh right, Adam. I want to be able to see how the value of the loss function changes in the UI, but it doesn't show anything right now. This is a part of my code, is there anything wrong you guys can spot by a glance? [<-LINK->] It does not output anything when I use KL_DIVERGENCE as loss function but it does when I use MSE 
solution: 

issue: I have successfully been able to run MultiGpuLenetMnistExample on a GPU. How can I know how many cores on the GPU is used? What is printed when starting the training does not come near the 3k cores that are available (" Number of threads used for NativeOps: 32" and "Cores: [4]; Memory: [13.3GB]") Thanks for clearing that up,@raver119. 
solution: 

issue: eraly: Since you appear to have a good math background could you please tell me what should I expect from the kl_divergence in an input reconstruction scenario? It confuses me a little by not being a true metric, should I expect it to increase as iterations go by? 
solution: 

issue: I'm trying to use Arbiter with an AutoEncoder layer but I get this error Causing: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.lang.ClassCastException: org.deeplearning4j.nn.layers.feedforward.autoencoder.AutoEncoder cannot be cast to org.deeplearning4j.nn.multilayer.MultiLayerNetwork Any tip?  [<-LINK->] this is my config of the hyperparameter space  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: sorensf: is that screenshot of classic lenet as in our lenetmnist example? i'm sorry, but can you please show me output log coming out from console? your screenshots make me doubt you're running that stuff on gpu 
solution: 

issue: 1) sure, I had not heard of this listener before. 2) sure, when you mean input specifications, you're referring to the data used for training? I just use the data from AnimalsClassification and copied the images a number of times until I had around 2500 images 
solution: On a somewhat related note, as I understand it, the datasets aren't loaded into the GPU memory until they are used, is it possible to pre-load them, or is it already taken care of by DL4j so there is no reason to?. 

issue: How do I get the weights from the hidden layer of an AE? Can't seem to find the method 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I get this run time error for builder.seed(123) call  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: raver119: : I added org.reflections 0.9.10 in my dependency and the problem was solved. But I don't see any reflections dependency on [<-LINK->] , either. 
solution: i don’t know what was your setup & how it happened actually.. 

issue: IntelliJ is getting me that new GravesLSTM.Builder().activation() is deprecated is that a 0.8.0 thing? 
solution: use enums rather than strings. 

issue: Hey guys, I'm migrating to core 0.8.0 and native 0.8.0, will these be compatible with native-platform 0.7.2? (I couldn't find a 0.8.0 on maven) Hi Susan, I an  [<-CODE->] Wow I'm typing terribly today! 
solution: (I blame my stupid fingers.). 

issue: hi, i am trying to upgrade from 0.7.2 to 0.8.0 and get following error: Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.bytedeco.javacpp.openblas any ideas? i am using following in pom: <dependency><groupId>org.deeplearning4j</groupId><artifactId>deeplearning4j-core</artifactId><version>0.8.0</version></dependency><dependency><groupId>org.nd4j</groupId><artifactId>nd4j-native</artifactId><version>0.8.0</version></dependency> eclipse =( 
solution: 

issue: plankes-projects: that should be fineonly thing is whether there was a problem downloading dependencies...what IDE are you using (intellij? eclipse?) yeah, we've seen issues with eclipse's maven support before p-tek: we're not a general java support channel, that has nothing to do with dl4j Garan105: yes, an output layer is basically a DenseLayer + a loss function 
solution: 

issue: p-tek: Welcome! Here's a link to Deeplearning4j's Gitter Guidelines, our documentation and other DeepLearning resources online. Please explore these and enjoy! [<-LINK->] 
solution: try this: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: how you are using  the model serializer looks fine to me. it may  be environment (android) specific? 
solution: 

issue: dykens: so my answer still stands the problem is with your input type normally either that or your configuration has negative output values that get calculated a big cause of this normally is your starting input size is too small for the convolution kernels setting the nout doesn't do anything transfer learning transfer learning uses mutable configs internally We havesomevalidation I agree with the premise of your github issue We need more 
solution: 

issue: Is there any reason to allow layer replacement? [<-LINK->]  [<-ISSUE->] wt.. this is not the issue I linked during configuration? mmmm..... [<-ISSUE->] but I see your point  [<-LINK->] this passes validation and fails at runtime so yeah. Something to indicate I'm dumb and just screwed up previously added layer would it make sense to check what layer id was added to config one call ago? 
solution: 

issue: UIExample throws the exception org.jboss.netty.channel.ChannelException: Failed to bind to: /0.0.0.0:9000. Where does it search for the server IP? it should localhost. ok, just submitted.also, -Dorg.deeplearning4j.ui.port=9001 doesn't seem to work, however, I'm not sure AlexDBlack: I found the root cause, anyway, thanks! 
solution: yes, but my question (in the first gist i created), the network seems to learn something for an epoch and then totally forget about it for the next epoch. For ex: the Score at iteration 2 (end of epoch 0) is 1.2472177505493165 but the Score at iteration 3 (start of epoch 1) is 71.99242553710937. 

issue: but the scores are going down? you're at 64-11-0.99 by the end... it's the same data over and over 
solution: 

issue: Hi I get this exception and its quite deep inside library. Could you give me hint, where the problem could lie?here is gist with exception: https://gist.github.com/papperwing/e641b58d79dc7f8dcb8f2bf1682bbea6I am building neural net for classification of multiple labels on image. From error it seems that program there is trying merge together two INDArray where one is image and one is label? Could it be happening there or am I misinterpreting that error?It seems that multiple images were processed successfully but some have problem. 
solution: 

issue: What are labels? They are used and not explained  in the following tutorial: [<-LINK->] It's the Linear Classifier (MLP) from Quickstart. Are they for differnt situations? Thanks for help! 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I switched to GPU but the following error appears:o.n.l.f.Nd4jBackend - Skipped [JCublasBackend] backend (unavailable): java.lang.RuntimeException: CUDA backend can't find NVCC within PATH environment variableBut nvcc IS in the PATH:$ echo $PATH/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/cuda/bin$ nvcc --versionnvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driverCopyright (c) 2005-2016 NVIDIA CorporationBuilt on Tue_Jan_10_13:22:03_CST_2017Cuda compilation tools, release 8.0, V8.0.61What should I do?

solution: thomas-a-bertz: file an !issue please. thomas-a-bertz: they go in DataVec, sorry :). 

issue: Any MNist implementation in deeplearning4j that scores under 1% in error rate? Apparently this paper "Massively Deep Artificial Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition" [<-LINK->] claims to have 0.72%, but the source code is no where to be found. 
solution: 

issue: Cawfree: bit confused here It's 1 line of code o_0 I mean what is there to error out on BS Describe what your problem is first This blanket hand wavy "lol guyz it doesn\'t work" is a bit much Repost your !gist? sure of course it\'s just a bit much to just say "it doesn\'t work" especially if you are on the latest version sure which is why I'm asking for a stack trace :D Or is it a logical error you're running in to? 
solution: 

issue: Cawfree: is there any way you can run a debugger? I\'ve googled this a bit and I"m trying to figure out what could be null there? this looks like an android curve ball :D 
solution: There's a lot of flush/close infinallyblocks that aren't properly safeguarded against the condition. 

issue: Cawfree: mind filing an issue describing this? I can post a quick fix with a way around this so you don't have to worry about this :D then you can just use the work around temporarily 
solution: 

issue: what@shankytyyou need to call flush I wouldn't worry about it :D just post the info in the issue like I asked actually better yet post a github project I can run in 
solution: shankyty: I meant what you said is correct. but flush is to pending bytes imediately.

solution: and nvidia site doesn't offer anything beyond that. and this 375.x has sooo many bugs :(. 

issue: Hey guys! Do you plan to support Spark's Structured Streaming API when it comes out of alpha? 
solution: wlsc: we'll pay more attention to it when a compelling use case comes out of it. ATM it's a bit brittle, an requires using internal APIs [<-LINK->] Happy to help you develop one such use case though :). 

issue: Does/should import of Keras weight file (H5)  for inception and/or VGG16  work with DL4J 0.7.2?   ... KerasModelImport.importKerasModelAndWeights(modelfile.getCanonicalPath(), weightfile.getCanonicalPath());  - or was it unfinished feature back then? 
solution: 

issue: you’ve got new macbook pro with nvidia gpu? :) 
solution: if not maybe someone interested in writing to suport it :). 

issue: Hey, I wrote a little gpu monitor script to estimate the gpu utilization distribution over time: [<-LINK->] Could be handy when doing optimizations on CUDA 
solution: It shows how much time the GPU utilizes 100%, 95%, 80% and less than 10%. 

issue: hello , i am having a strange issue with NativeImageloader … when i call …         INDArray data = imageLoader.asRowVector(file);it just hangs … any help would be much appreciated … thanks the programm just never responds or continues … it stalls no i am running in eclipse. i did not publish any screen i just have a small color image 10*10 , trying to convert to INDArray with NAtiveImageLoader , the call never finishes

issue: Hello to everyone ! I'm starting to use DL4J, but I didn't succeed in importing the depencies in Maven... Could someone help me, please ? For example, I added this :<dependency>\n            <groupId>org.nd4j</groupId>\n            <artifactId>${nd4j.backend}</artifactId>\n        </dependency> In the block<dependencies> 
solution: 

issue: MultiLayerConfiguration conf = new NeuralNetConfiguration.Builder()[...]this line doesn't work : it seems that NeuralNetConfiguration is not a MultiLayerConfiguration 
solution: Jars-of-jam-Scheduler: k so again. It shows how to do the transition with list. I feel like you're trying to learn from scratch without having studied or trying to understand the semantics first. 

issue: herofe: All of your gpu memory should be available, if it's underloaded you can increase the minibatch size. The arrays are transparently copied to and from gpu so you should probably have Xmx set to be at least of your VRAM size. Anyway, the best method is to actually measure your VRAM load with nvidia-smi (Linux) or a windows analog if you're on windows 
solution: nvidia-smi doesn't show some data on some GPUs like GPU utilization is shown as N/A on my old GTX 770 but works fine on 1070. 

issue: Okay so I will  concatenate these examples into only one file. So the number of mini-batches will be the number of your 2D matrices in my file, isn't it ? 
solution: 

issue: Jars-of-jam-Scheduler: you don't need toinita model that was loaded from a zip file, otherwise you have to init it  [<-ISSUE->] it works... supposedly 
solution: 

issue: if I mentionned the above code, that's because you asked me to read and understand some existing code in fact, then I found something that seems to work there, but not for me, I just found it weird =/ but okay, I'm reading your javadoc and some other articles I don't =/ 
solution: 

issue: But I have a question : would the iris example be useful for me ? because in their training dataset "iris.txt" ( [<-LINK->] ) , there are "coma" as delimitors. I actually could use that in my own dataset. 
solution: Your goal is to look at the components of a full pipeline. 

issue: I am not sure what you mean. You can check hasnext() on the iterator? 
solution: Alas, no gist am just trying to figure the design. My aim is to implement stochastic depth network. 

issue: Hehe. You have a !gist to show me what you want to implement differently? pseudo code will do. 
solution: 

issue: I'm a cynical, melodramatic southern Californian 
solution: two major nice thingies in there. CenterLossOutput and manipulation API so I can finally cut my autoencoder nicely in the middle. More coming. Raver is getting rid of GC. 

issue: Hi everyone, i have an issue when i tried to install the deeplearning4j-examples, i've already copied them from git like Quickstart said, but when tried install them with maven, i have this error:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: renzoqa256: you have bad network config. try vpn or other provider. 

issue: Maven actually tries to connect to some local IP 10.230.6.10 
solution: 

issue: Hi. Are there any examples of using data-vec for transforming data in csv-files (appears to have to entail Spark) while using the data after transformation for training a network locally (no "sparknetwork") ? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I am new to dl4j and was trying to run the dl4j examples on my system. I followed the QuickStart guide, but am using eclipse. However, when I import the project and try to build it, I get the error 'log cannot be resolved'. Any ideas on how to resolve this would be appreciated! yes, It said the build was successful when I did a mvn clean install 
solution: 

issue: rkfg: It was the maven's proxy, i commented those lines and now it's downloading. Thanks a lot !! 
solution: 

issue: I am using an ImageRecordReader to read pgns. I specify 1 channel making the images grayscale. Is there a simple way of binarizing the image data? As far as I understand the ImagePreProcessingScaler does do something like that but not completely. It will convert values 0-255 to 0.0-1.0. However it will not set only 0 or 1. Am I correct? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: Thank you Adam for hte info!I checked but seems this class is not in the javadoc, perhaps the javadoc is not up to date? [<-LINK->] :D undestood, that's a key point, I need to regenerate the latest javadoc on my own perhaps somebody could update in case someone's reading online like me 
solution: 

issue: Can this example issue be closed? [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: raver119:  [<-ISSUE->] ,  I need your help:-) I verified your suggestion, it does not work~ 
solution: 

issue: because we have no ideas how particular user will be using nd4j we can't really assume that scopes will be local we can't assume that there'll be no complex references KurtYoung: we're all open to suggestions :) however, as i've already said twice - we're working on additional memory management model, that won't rely on gc 
solution: I get the idea that you trigger the gc for yourself. But i don't get why they are all full gc.... 

issue: raver119: i have created a gist. Containing the link to the gensim sample (just see there the infering vector chapter), a shell script for downloading and providing the training data and a scala file for training and testing it with dl4j. [<-LINK->] libraries are only nd4j and dl4j with nlp 0.8.0, shall i provide a build.sbt for that? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: the one uncommented, i tried to imitate the dbow settings of the gensim example. But also with DM and other settings it is not working 
solution: 

issue: In my Dataset, for some classes(labels) the datapoints are very less, while for some classes(Labels) the dataPoints are very high. I did the "shuffle" as well on my dataset.I am running Single layer Network. And i get very low accuracy. I saw the warning as:"Warning: class 2 was never predicted by the model. This class was excluded from the average precision".Is there a way to balance the dataset, or add random noise to that class(Label). kepricon: , Thank for the quick response. I'll check it out. kepricon: , wow, actually, it worked.. Thanks.. :) 
solution: 

issue: Hi again, If I specify the weightInit() for the NeuralNetConfiguration.Builder builder object, does it mean that it uses the same weightInit strategy for all the layers in the network? I ask this because I saw that the weightInit can also be independently specified for different layers 
solution: I'd imagine so. I think adding it to different layers would override that default strategy that's applied.. (For that layer). 

issue: is there any way i can run it? or only soln is pump up ram? 
solution: asmehra95: Yes, but probably not that much more.  I run dl4j on a 5 year old MBA with only 4 GB of ram.. 

issue: hello, the output of TSNEStandardExample seems weird to me (I must be doing something wrong). But when I try to visualize the output with the gnu plot command that is included in the java source comments, I get "line 0: warning: Skipping data file with no valid points" and "line 0: x range is invalid". Can I get some help here? Thanks. 
solution: 

issue: Hey, you'll hurt my Mac Book Air's feelings. 
solution: Cawfree: well you usually want to train it like a normal neural net. 

issue: Can't you process the data incrementally rather than all in one go? Yeah but I mean, if memory is  a problem you could throttle the learning rate and use smaller batches maybe? simd? 
solution: 

issue: In the UCISequenceClassificationExample, why wasn't the trainFeatures encoded using 1-hot encoding scheme? SequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator is being used to read the features and labels file. The labels is (internally) going to be converted to 1-hot automatically. So, why not use the 1-hot for features? 
solution: 

issue: no matter what I do, when I run jmap on my process, it shows 2GB max heap:MaxHeapSize              = 2147483648 (2048.0MB)

solution: 

issue: atalw: do you have the latest dl4j version (0.8.0)? 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys, sorry it took so long to get back. When I try to use theModelSerializerto parse aMultiLayerNetworkwithin the Google App Engine, I receive this security exception. I think that hopefully, if I disable logging, the error will go away; is this possible? [<-LINK->] Ah, I've found the source of the problem. TheModelSerializerallocates a temporary file usingFile.createTempFile. This can't be used on the GAE.

solution: romawhite: no man, please define it doesn’t work. 

issue: I have a simple doubt. Is RBM good option for classification problem where images are not involved. 
solution: 

issue: YAAAAAAAAAAAY. DL4J, you guys are the best. Neural Network server with serialisation is up and running. :D 
solution: I nicknamed that the "response". It's when input interacts with the weights. 

issue: Guys, help me somebody. I'm just testing  dl4j for my self. I try implement MNIST example by my own. But during the compilation I have smth like that: "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/nd4j/linalg/api/complex/IComplexNumber" agibsonccc: I use nd4j-api-0.8.0.jar as external dependency, it has been resolved by idea and imports work. But at the step of NNConfiguration building it faild with message about IComplexNumber. I can't find IComplexNumber in dl4j source code 
solution: Whether or not you supply it depends on the task. If you need the context, you supply it. If you need your words to depend on each other you provide the previous word as well. You may add another layer that "compresses" several previous sentences into one more "thought vector" and as such you\'ll be able to provide more context to the conversation. That\'s only my guess but it should work like that. I also read about something called like "highway" networks that supposedly use characters together with the word-tokens, they could "invent" words from those characters if a word didn\'t make it into the dictionary. Again, I may be wrong here..

issue: i have a question with regards to the word2vecsentimentRNN does the network just train and test on the exact same data? instead of dividing the dataset into a 70:30 ratio for training and testing? 
solution: birinhos: that doesnt matter eclipse has m2 eclipse. 

issue: Ok I will have to see this in more depth ... at first glance (compred to others NN I have used) the work does not look simplified having a jar file to download would be a good starting point

solution: 

issue: I'm interested what the cuDNN speedup may be if LSTM is implemented in it, compared to the current CUDA implementation I only found cuDNN vs CPU comparisons and that's not quite interesting agibsonccc: I know, I only want to know if it has been done already and if there are actual results However, LSTMs aren't yet supported on cuDNN so that test is currently impossible to do After all, there should be no proprietary magic in cudnn They're using the same cuda API but they may use some tricks and optimizations 
solution: 

issue: Is it possible train RNN with multiple features ?Eg:  In  stock market multiple factors to achieve a market valuefeature1:    feature2:    feature3:    market value10:            20:        1    :        10.511:               12:            1    :        11.5 
solution: Not for your case, but the RNN examples use two inputs, you can look how it's done there. 

issue: You definitely have to normalize it to around 0...1 Balancing mini batches yes but not for balancing data. There's lots of ways to do it and the right way really depends on the use case. 
solution: Never done financial things so I might be completely out of line but I think you could also use the log values and transform them back for your predictions.. 

issue: Hi everyone, could you please help me identify the cause of this error, i.e. whether I have to look into my network design or into my data design.  [<-LINK->] I am trying to build a seq2seq model 
solution: bikashg: Sounds like your network is configured funny.. 

issue: Why are the arguments of the method called weights? We just implements train and test data raver119: I saw the source, but can you summarize the logic? Who can answer - how I must specify arguments? If you cannot answer, why this method have these arguments, not only such as fileSplit.sample(pathFilter) ?

solution: 

issue: Quick question: with variable length time series, does it matter for training and/or inference whether the data is aligned left vs right? I'd think not, but maybe there are subtle differences 
solution: 

issue: raver119: did you edit the gist ? thank you 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. it misses some of your spark deps. but it contains dl4j/nd4j + shade configuration. you shouldn’t need anything else from nd4j dep used there. 

issue: okay .. Is there any example of breaking a deep NN (pretrained with  autoencoder) in half to get the layer of most abstraction and then add one new output layer (in my case one neuron) and then "post" train supervised with backprop ? btw there is RPROP implemented ? no I have done all steps with maven and all that its working ok .. but my problem in the end has 1 output if I add that layer and use autoencoder it will not work right ? 
solution: Most autoencoder implementations use tied weights. 

issue: I'm soooo waiting for implementing the workspace-powered memory manager for CUDA For now it's CPU-only it seems I built that and it thrown an exception that CUDA is currently not supported so... 
solution: My process starts fine but after 140 iterations or so I'm running out of VRAM constantly.... 

issue: rkfg: it shouldn't throw exception actually, my last commit there was made when initial tests passed but it's NOT integrated into dl4j yet, besides of async dataset iterator that integration will be next step 
solution: birinhos: you can take any of the layer definitions in there and use that for your autoencoder.

issue: Hi, anyone had any trouble starting the UIServer in a scala project? I keep getting a NullPointerException when I try and do:uiServer = UIServer.getInstance 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I'm looking at this example on github. [<-LINK->] I am wondering if there is a way to feed one unlabeled image that's a jpg into the network? 
solution: 

issue: !tuning that's all we've got for now 
solution: 

issue: the weights here is not relevant to the number of layers, it's about how to divide the smaples for training and testing 
solution: and Alex Black has given the answer, please check the  number of the animal samples. 

issue: MikeF23: Feel free to file an !issue if there are any methods you thing need more documentation. 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys, I was wondering if something analogous to EmbeddingLayer would be possible for a classification output layer, i.e. use an integer between 0 and num_classes as label instead of a one hot vector for training. In this case, the model would still have n outputs in reality, but it would just be a way to compress data sets with lots of classes 
solution: Well, similar to how EmbeddingLayer that supports n input classes encoded in a single input is equivalent to having n inputs with one-hot encoding. Again, AFAIK embedding is used as an optimization so that the computation speed is increased and memory requirements become a bit lower. 

issue: Right now I'm experimenting with a classification output for my time series prediction task, where I'm quantizing the possible output values into logarithmical bins. This way I'm getting the probability for every possible output range, which is very useful. However, on average I'm dealing with 200 time steps, I have 12 graph outputs and they have about 40 classes each 
solution: 

issue: Hello@raver119, about the issue I opened awhile ago [<-ISSUE->] , after adding cuDNN the graphs looks as I would expect them too, and trainings takes 11 seconds down from 2.5 minutes, so from my point of view cuDNN fixed the issue. Should I close the issue or would you like to keep it open as an issue for "non-cuDNN" setups? 
solution: 

issue: Hy,Is it possible to apply RELU act function in a CNN between a ConvolutionLayer and a PoolingLayer such as in this [<-LINK->] .When I try to do it I get the error: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Invalid input for Subsampling layer (layer name="layer2"): Expected CNN input, got InputTypeFeedForward(0)I have been using this [example as reference] ( [<-LINK->] ).Thank you!

issue: Hello, I can ’t load my wor2vec model. Before, when I used previous version (0.7.2) and i load it whithout any problem but now, I get this error [<-LINK->] I tried with a small model it’s ok but for his one beacause the file is very huge (30GO) raver119: do you now why ? 
solution: 

issue: ok what is the number of column shoud I used for this version (0.8.0) ? 
solution: 

issue: Hello,Can you guys take a look at these errors. I suspect they are because of the packaging of jar with maven. Any help would be appreciated. [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: birinhos: check this out please: [<-LINK->] !examples 
solution: 

issue: birinhos: You want to remove 5 layers from the output? 
solution: You only need to do .removeLayersFromOutput(5) it will remove the last five layers. The argument is the number of layers you want to remove.. then in this new NN I dont want "pretrain". 

issue: vlovsky: not sure yet. I might have to run that in debugger first to check. I'll post on that issue once I've had a chance to take a look birinhos: post your full code and the full stack trace in a !gist birinhos: try setting the fine tune config before adding the output layer one thing I find strange in dl4j is to have the work (function) backpropagation(boolen) "hardcoded" ... If I wanted to use pso for example ?what? I have no idea what you are talking about there. can you rephrase? 
solution: 

issue: hi there. Is there any way I can optimize following code? [<-LINK->] this loop is killing me 
solution: 

issue: birinhos: PSO as in particle swarm optimization? we don't have it (I don't know of any major DL framework that does) birinhos: you are the first person to ever complain about thatwe're not going to implement PSO, or genetic optimization, period 
solution: 

issue: Can i load model from file and train it one more times Some one can tell me? Thank you 
solution: hoangtocdo90: yes, you can. 

issue: Hi, does dl4j let me define a custom cost function? Also, do I have to write my own data iterator if I have the data set such that some of the columns in it are used to train the neural network and some other columns are used in the training function? 
solution: and no, depending on the format. for something like CSV, you can specify label indices (for multi-output regression, for example). 

issue: hibernator11: what do you mean with "build a corpus with word2vec" ? martinsgg:  [<-LINK->] well, w2v builder allows you to specify those stopWords so i'm still not sure what's your problem. set up w2v object, specify training corpus, run it with w2v.fit() v.assign(0.0f);

issue: Hi, what is the best way to zero out an array in ND4J. Now I use v.putRow(0, zeros). thank you 
solution: 

issue: hello, I have a problem while importing a trained network from keras.. when dropout layer is used  I receive a nullpointer.. looking at you code I find you are extracting a "p" element, I suspect it should be a "rate" but I\'m not sure error comes from keras importer modelconfiguration: line   prevDropout = (double)layerConfig.get("p"); 0.7.1 I have other problems with 0.8 but I can move to 0.8 if it is a known bug 
solution: but yeah, I'd suggest opening an issue and hopefully@turambarwill have a chance to look at it soon (he's working on 1d conv layers currently). 

issue: marioarrigonineri: just to check: are you using version 0.8.0? I'm not sure - but there's been a lot of work on model import done since then (and, a lot since 0.7.2 too) I'd definitely check 0.8.0 though 
solution: 

issue: raver119: at the moment i simply build a w2v model based on my corpus and i just have labelled the skill i have in my dictionary nothing else 
solution: 

issue: i will give me more detail...i doing a call :D 
solution: We’re still assessing the scope of changes in Keras 2 and making plans to support it, but it’s looking like a lof of cosmetic changes that will break model import. 

issue: hi. can someone help? I have two dimensional matrix. I need to set first and last column of each row to 0. Was looking into BooleanIndexing, but I didn't find how to construct condition with respect to value coordinates not the value itself. ahh... that'l work. so simple thanks yep 
solution: 

issue: compile fileTree(include: ['*.jar'], dir: 'libs')i'm not sure, if jar recompilation happens there, mind adding .so to the includes list? just to check, what happens. ok :( well, let me know what emulator will show also, you can file an !issue pkarira: file an issue please !issue 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I'm new in nd4j and I try to use conv2d function and get a such error. Arguments is two INDArrays with rank two. Am I doing something wrong? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] I wonder how this was working because there's a typo: $model_typet should be $model_type It was there from the very first version of the file Also, I couldn't get it working in its current state, no clear instructions are provided Issue is fine but PR isn't enough I guess The paths used are all wrong, it needs a thorough rewrite I just wondered how it worked in the first place 
solution: Such a thing is a must anyway. 

issue: DonaldAlan: I thought that Maven would automatically download the CUDA libraries, no? adanecito: @raver119@DonaldAlanOf course, I have a video card with cuda-support, but I thought maybe the Maven could download all the necessary libraries. It would be convenient 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: My intuition about proportion of one\'s vs zerro\'s proved to be close to what was happening. To describe the problem in one word it probably can be characterized as "afterimage", not sure if this is known in NN industry. [<-LINK->] 
solution: After few experiments I found what was happening. The network memorized the last trained image so well, that it would always output that for any test case. Seem like overfitting, but each new training image would completely rewire the NN. So, not sure if that is an overfitting in a classical meaning. Funny that for several images in a batch the network would try to merge all of them in one. That's why I though it was just junk and it wasn't learning. One I started to experiment with teaching one image at a time I realized what was happening.. 

issue: ZizhengTai: mind filing an !Issue on dl4j and arbiter? I'd rather us be writing that kind of code Your use case doesn't sound too outlandish 
solution: 

issue: Hmm say if my batch size is 4096 so that each minibatch cannot fit on one GPU, what exactly should I do to make it work? Increase the number of workers? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: Hi Adam, I\'ve gone through the code forParallelWrapper; are "workers" logical tasks that will get run in turns by all available GPUs? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, are there methods available to solve linear systems, compute the determinant and SVD decomposition of a matrix? Thanks :) Is [<-LINK->] the best way to access the BLAS routines? I can't find the determinant or SVD decomposition in the docs. agibsonccc: thanks, I think I got enough to compute what I need. 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I was trying to just run a dl4j example in a java based simulation tool. The simulation tool generally lets me import jars and run my own java files. I was able to build the example from dl4j 'XorExample' without errors. However, while trying to run the example, it failed with the following message: Error during model creation:org/nd4j/linalg/factory/Nd4jBackend$NoAvailableBackendExceptionCaused by: org.nd4j.linalg.factory.Nd4jBackend$NoAvailableBackendExceptionjava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/nd4j/linalg/factory/Nd4jBackend$NoAvailableBackendExceptionat testdl4j.XorExample.<init>(XorExample.java:103)at testdl4j.Main.setupPlainVariables_Main_xjal(Main.java:295)at testdl4j.Main.doCreate(Main.java:251) Any hints on what could have caused this exception (org/nd4j/linalg/factory/Nd4jBackend$NoAvailableBackendException) would be appreciated. Please help... 
solution: Yes, I did that on Eclipse.. I don't think AnyLogic supports Maven integration and I am trying to use dl4j with AnyLogic... 

issue: I'm getting it like that now.data().pointer().asByteBuffer().order(ByteOrder.nativeOrder()).asFloatBuffer().get(floats);, and it seems to work fine now, and yes, it spends most of the time waiting for sync hm... ok, that actually doesn't work, but just now it did, and I'm confused 
solution: that assumes - actual memory has to be copied from device to host. so, there comes sync first. 

issue: if I don't call out to actually get the data back it runs plenty fast, so it can't be just the gemm call itself 
solution: yep, those 4 ms are apparently sync time... I've forced the sync of that buffer and then got it via that code you said I don't want to, and I get exactly that. 

issue: mind explaining me your use case in pm? maybe we could work something out there 
solution: 

issue: abholer: not sure what you'd be looking for there I guess? Dl4j is just a spark job What would you put in the container? 
solution: I feel like you're just pairing buzzwords together here :D. usually you already have cluster.... 

issue: If you want to just run it on 1 node why not just run the spark examples from intellij? I wouldn't use dl4j as a spark proof of concept They have some simpler hello worlds you can run After your hello worlds run then try dl4j I would troubleshoot setting up a spark cluster separately from adding an additional library 
solution: 

issue: raver1975: all I can say from my puny experience is that the whole industry is not yet at that level of abstraction. there are still quite a few knobs you need to tweak to make it all work. eventually this all will go away. cant say how many years/decades from today 
solution: my idea of a hack is to cluster the vectors into an "alphabet", and then use the shakespeare demo to predict the next characters and then unpack that back into vectors.. 

issue: Yes, indeed...  It is not going to be effective to work backwards if things don't go well (I only keep hope when trying an experiment, not expectations). 
solution: 

issue: Am I gimping myself using sublime for Python?

issue: I tried visualizing using [<-LINK->] . I added the code to start the UI and started the learning, but when I visited [<-LINK->] no graphs appeared. It kept saying "Loading...". Is this a known issue? 
solution: When I run UIExample.java the same thing happens:  no graphs and it says "Loading..."   I\'m running the cuda backend?  Do I need to run the cpu backend?. 

issue: So, bug in IntelliJ? It works from the command line anyway...

issue: Hi! I\'m testing out the arbiter after just finding it. Got the basic example working, and changed it to "arbite" on a simple cnn with the minst dataset. Getting errors of input size is invalid, not matching output size in the first subsampling layer.  Can\'t find any documentation or examples, any hints? 
solution: 

issue: hello I have my model trained now I would like to test/execute with just one inputexample I have my single test example in one double[35] I think I have to convert to INDArray and execute model.output(INDArray) and execute model.output(INDArray,false) (this false is to say that is not a training execution right ? )

issue: If I have another thread reading inputs from layers of a running net, do I need to synchronize the threads? Or can I read the state at anytime with code likenetwork.getLayer(layerIndex).input().getDouble(coordinatesInLayerInput);?  The reason I'm asking is that it all seems to freeze after running for a minute. 
solution: 

issue: Hi. Does DL4J support incremental learning? I tried find some examples on google but I didn't found any valuable examples agibsonccc: but can I save and restore my model, and learn on new examples when they arrive ? In RegressionMathFunctions example network fit to full data set So, I just need divide data in batches and then fit on every batch? I have a lot of "starting data" to learn net but newer data comes in days/hours so I don\'t want learn on full data set every time but just on new data But, as you say, I'm able to do that :)

I assume you created it in java? I'm thinking it's either a version issue (created some versions back, loaded in a new version)or some previously unseen bug (basically, the lossFn field shouldn't be like that)

issue: Dear,i\'m reading the https://deeplearning4j.org/sentenceiterator. Currently i have a file with a document per line but i would like to "sentenize" it so i get a sentence per line.I think i need the  UimaSentenceIterator for that but when i try to import it into my source i cannot seem to find the UimaSentenceIterator class. agibsonccc: Ah i actually need a dutch analysis for splitting the dutch sentences. I guess i will have to use my  own openNLP code to do this.

issue: Hy,For the DataSetIterator, the labelIndexing starts from 0 or from 1?More particularly, for RecordReaderDataSetIterator if I have the label in the first column of my CSV file, should i have the labelIndex as 0 or 1?Thank you for your help! 
solution: 

issue: Trying to run some data thro the LSTM SingleTimestepRegressionExample. I find I can only input 150 training points after which I get NANs and/or infinities depending on sequence length. Could someone please give me some pointers. I am just replaced the CSV in the example with my own data and have not changed any network setup parameters... 
solution: CSimmo: you shouldn't expect that random nn you've found in examples will fit your problem.. 

issue: Hy,Does anyone have an idea why I get this result when evaluating the model? [<-LINK->] RecordReaderDataSetIterator does not complain and the output of one of my examples looks like this:[[1.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00]] 
solution: 

issue: This is covered here: [<-LINK->] We don't really have a way of knowing which cuda version you have installed we also support 2 cuda versions not sure where you're coming from here.. alternatives usually are "compile this from source" :D where the compiler tells you the cuda version we\'re "include a jar file" raver also already told you how to do multi gpu ...but you have 1 gpu we can't create gpus out of thin air I'd love to know how though uhhh 
solution: a gpu is a physical thing you can touch and buy. 

issue: Can MultiLayerNets hold the String Labels?  Right now my labels are an index in a String[], but if I dont have the string[] I dont know what the class is. 
solution: 

issue: yep, there's no way to run java code on gpu. so when you see cuda used somewhere - you know, it's c. or fortran. but usually c. 
solution: but if 1 gpu is 1 cuda core. 

issue: raver119: btw, if the workspace approach recycles the unneeded memory, does that mean that CudaZeroHandler.free() (and maybe purgeDeviceObject()?) won't be called or called much less often that they are now? Cool. I noticed they take most of the CPU time Isn't there some sort of synchronization for the device itself? Uhuh 
solution: 

issue: hello everyone! I'm trying to run the Arbiter and stop it after it executes without stopping my main application; I've looked at this example [<-LINK->] but it doesn't apply since System.exit stops the main java thread...  do you have any ideas how to do this in an easy manner? thanks! first thing i tried was without System.exit(0), but this way even after the main java thread finished everything, the thread remains alive... 
solution: 

issue: Just remove the System.exit(0) line, no? It's called just visualvm afaik I use it, too. It's good. 
solution: i’m from that time, when it was called jvisualvm :(. 

issue: well, i've installed the visualvm plugin for IntelliJ but I don't know what the path required is... i'll resume this tomorrow... :) thanks a lot guys! :) 
solution: you don’t need any plugins for it. just run visualvm, pick target process, and you’re done. 

issue: LauraKate3: better to wait for raver119. what version are you using? As far as I can see from 0.8.1 code, the possibility of this happening is virtually 0 ah 
solution: it\'s also known as "transitive dependencies versions conflict". 

issue: Does DL4J support importing arbitrary pre-trained Keras models? I saw in documentation it has support for functional and sequential but I was curious if it covered every permutation of model you could make in Keras.

issue: Could someone refer me to some example, how to work correctly with ComputationGraph and ComputationGraphConfiguration? 
solution: papperwing: it’s not that different from mln really. just more compositional options.  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: raver119: Could you give me hint in one thing? I want to allow users to define their own number of output labels (I want to change output layer) and I want them to specify some prelearned models (vgg16, resnet150, ...) which will be used for transfer learning. So the question is, if I want to use CG instead of MLN. The examples for transfer learning is written with CG but in CG JavaDoc is, that if I dont want to do more magic with that I should use MLN instead. Ok thanks for you time :) I will go probably with CG because of examples and It seems that it is only more complicated in terms of config which I will not get into much.

issue: hi guys -- i think the dtype property setting is broken again in nd4j 0.8.0 passing -Ddtype=double to JVM doesn't change the dtype to double it remains as FLOAT 
solution: 

issue: could you specifically set the property for the unit test in Run -> Edit Configurations... -> JDK settings -> VM options ? 
solution: but don't you create a new instance with the new dtype? [<-LINK->]. 

issue: I'm not certain how to create a multidataset iterator. Is there an implementation where I can give a single multidataset and the iterator  will spit out minibatches? I can do this manually but there is lots of functionality seemingly attached to iterators, and I can't seem to find it for multidataset versions. 
solution: Well for example I can split up my data set into many multidataset and then I was looking for something that would take this and then iterate over these (so that I could use the async loading). I agree manual seems to be the easiest right now.. 

issue: Is it possible to import Keras model with embedding layers to DL4j? I have been trying but it seems import keras embedding layer is not supported in DL4j 
solution: 

issue: abholer: that sounds like a mis matched spark version maybe? We run on spark 1 and 2 but you have to configure the right version 
solution: There's 1 billion things for us to pay attention to. We aren't going to catch everything.. 

issue: the Fig 1 shows , some one only rates some movies ,not all movies , so those not rated movies should be missing feature. they can't be build into the net. guess if dl4j support that process 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I have configured an lstm network but when I try to fit(dataset) I get this error, java.lang.IllegalStateException: Mis matched lengths: [200] != [24000] with 200 as my number of examples. Where might be the problem? The full stack trace [<-LINK->] and of course you're right. thank you 
solution: 

issue: k0enf0rNL: !tuningbeyond that - yes, your best option is reading the literature and understanding the configuration options. There's no single guide or shortcut unfortunately [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] are good places to start k0enf0rNL: normalization and learning rate are two possible causes but not the only ones 
solution: 

issue: I'm having planning to train a network with spark on sge cluster. I'm running spark/1.6.0-hadoop-2.6Is this version supported?  How do I set spark-submit to use hadoop? 
solution: mauricioob: this will work yes. 

issue: Just to make sure I have this right, if I want to copy a multilayernetwork, does new MultiLayerNetwork(configuration, toCopyMLN.params()) work? 
solution: 

issue: So I can't use parallelization when using a time series neural network? 
solution: 

issue: Quick question about EarlyStoppingTrainer. It looks like that work withMultiLayerNetworkbut notComputationGraph. Is that right? 
solution: 

issue: Does DeepLearning4J have a lot of the same features as TensorFlow? 
solution: dl4j actually has 10000000000000000000x more features than TF but aimed at folks building products and integrating with the big data ecosystem. 

issue: angingao: it's a warning regarding some plugin versions (we should fix it, but it's not really important)as long as it completes successfully, you are ok 
solution: 

issue: Hi all, I have found broken link in the documentation. I wasn't sure if that was something worth opening an issue on github. [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: altugygt: you can't, HDF5 isn't available for Android 
solution: 

issue: mikhail247: you probably aren't taking into account the limited precision of toString on INDArraysI just checked, an array with values exactly 0.01 and 0.12 is giving what I would expect  [<-CODE->] 0.120415940 that's what I get for both cases... DonaldAlan: cool, looks great 
solution: 

issue: DonaldAlan: that's some really cool stuff :) mind if I tweet that out? 
solution: No problem.. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] hi, I want some help! jdk1.7,  when I run the first example:MLPLinearClassifier, but found some error: thanks to all! 
solution: 

issue: Does anyone know why this error occurs? [<-LINK->] I have a dependency to use the nd4j backend in my pom.xml :         <dependency><groupId>org.nd4j</groupId><artifactId>nd4j-native</artifactId><version>0.8.0</version></dependency> 0.8.0 
solution: On the nd4j website it says to just use native: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: I got a similar error to this: [<-ISSUE->] when running v0.8.0/spark 2.1 standalone version. When I downgraded to v0.7.2/spark1.6.0 it worked. I need to use spark2.1 in our environment, is this a possibility? 
solution: 

issue: Hi!  Trying regression with dl4j, got information from the article [<-LINK->] , the problem is that version 0.7.2 doesn't have LossFunction.RMSE, what is the best LossFunction from the actual version ? 
solution: 

issue: When using a DataSetIterator how do I retrieve my test data from the first batch? \nWhy does my prediction go to -6.500 while my test data goes to +30.000? Could the weight be the cause of this? currently using Xavier for a LSTM RNN 
solution: 

issue: LauraKate3: Does the same issue occur when you replace ${nd4j.version} with 0.8.0 ? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: okay thank you, I'm also getting this error message in my output: Unfortunately you can't use DL4j/ND4j on 32-bit x86 JVMPlease, consider running this on 64-bit JVM instead 
solution: it only means idea is using 64bit jvm.. 

issue: To paraphrase my above message, Is there a difference betweenfor (int x : range (of 10 items)) sparkNet.fit(data)andmlnconfig.iterations(10); sparkNetWithMlnConfig.fit(data)? From looking at the code, it seems like there might be, but I want to make sure for the new spark-ml module. If there is, I will have to add a separate epochs variable to the sparkNetwork. 
solution: 

issue: is it possible to use rddTrainingApproach.Export in a spark standalone cluster without hadoop/hdfs? I tried setting TrainingMaster.exportDirectory to a network path but I'm getting an error:Export training approach is not supported in the current environment 
solution: 

issue: Ok so why off-heap memory?  I know there's a good reason--I just want to make sure I understand it.  According to this, [<-ISSUE->] you can run CPU native code on java primitive arrays without a copy. So I am guessing the main reason is to work the the GPU? pinned cpu memory, that sort of thing but i also imagine you had other reasons, hence my asking. work with the gpu 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: Thank you.  Would love to hear more detail about what net lib gets wrong here. possibly the model just learned to always predict no 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: Yes I fixed my previous error, I figured out that the nd4j backend error was actually due to using a 32bit JVM instead of 64bit JVM (even though I had 64bit version of Intellij and 64bit jdk, it was pointing at the wrong jdk in the intellij settings) 
solution: 

issue: :) haha - seriously? Nice limitation... even on win10, ok then I move things to the cloud just was ready to give you the data loading code :) ok good to know by the way: I think I got a grasp why it did not use the K80 and hope I found a resolution - I'll write a technote if that can be confirmed as I had quite a hard time to move things to the K80 AND GET IT UTILIZED i.e. you'd recommend running things on linux (not really surprised here)? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: Pls send an email to jweaver at pivotal.io so that I'll have your email 
solution: JavaFXpert: check pm.

solution: 

issue: What should I expect in terms of GPU utilization on a single GPU? I am getting around 70%-80%. Is it good or bad? 100% is atainable? 
solution: Tried changing basicly everything I find in the documentation. The only thing that has helped so far is the size of the batches.. 

issue: Regarding AsyncDataSetIterator, the javadoc says "PLEASE NOTE: If used together with CUDA backend, please use it with caution." Why is that? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] I have saved  regression model of 5layers (1-input,3-hidenlayers,1 -output) with 4 inputs and 1 output .I tried to create a Computation Graph that recreates this model but i get  this error. ok.Here is the link for [<-LINK->] and The Computation graph where i face exception [<-LINK->] 
solution: .addLayer("output", new OutputLayer.Builder().lossFunction(LossFunction.MSE).nIn(4).nOut(1)                        .activation(Activation.IDENTITY).build(), "L04"). 

issue: Emr03: it might be keras 2 related? We've had inception for a while now. File an !issue if you have problems chejuro: I'm not sure what you mean (we can't read minds) but 99% of nd4j is views. We don't copy data for our ndarrays 
solution: 

issue: Is there any place which shows installation in netbeans environment Thanks@raver119 I tried intellij idea however have problems configuring it :-) am far from 3 clicks :-) hold on ! let me give this a try I am running CSVExample.java and it gives me Error:java: Fatal Error: Unable to find package java.lang in classpath or bootclasspath alright@raver119i will try to get it sorted out, thanks! Fixed it ! the examples work fine will start testing the algorithms ;-) 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: is there a way to invoke a "surgical", nd4j-specific garbage collection, after calling a method that creates a lot of garbage Pointers? it would be a great feature, at least for me :) 
solution: You can check two nd4j and dl4j prs called workspace.. New mechanics come to dl4j and nd4j for memory reuse without gc reliance. 

issue: Hello, i wanna ask about my porject using word2vec lib. Is sentence boundary taken into account in word2vec? agibsonccc: that is for dl4j word2vec implementation. 
solution: 

issue: Hello,I am trying to compress the arithmetic representation of an NDArray.When I run Nd4j.getCompressor().compress(array):Non-existent compression algorithm requested: [FP16]Any ideas? raver119: It's just one line that's why I pasted here. [<-LINK->] is the gist as well 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: sorry for coming back to the issue with the iteration order: If I check your code, the resulting NDArray has a row major ordering X,Y,Channel, which means first rows, then columns, then channels. Linear array would be: (Row(col1,channel1), Row(col2, channel1), ..., Row(col1, channel2), Row(col2, channel2), ... etc.). This is the data the NDArray (flat) contains after dataset.next() call. Is this correct? So if I have an image in memory, this is the way I should represent it to feed into a neural network or is there some reordering happening to actually match (depth, height, width) with c-ordering?  (ignoring minibatch for now). 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I have computed a Transforms.log(INDArray, base=10) now I want to reverse to initial values, eg. something like Transforms.pow(INDArray, base=10) but cant find the right method. Should I scan each Double one by one? 
solution: 

issue: I'm new to gitter ... I'm sure you didn't notice it ! I will have soon a Mesos/Spark/DL4J configuration to do so I'll be back soon! I have a kaggle to do ...@agibsoncccI hope you're not gonna do the same kaggle contest I do, otherwise there's no hope ;)

issue: Hey guys, I'm having trouble using the dl4j word2vec. I used IntelliJ and maven to get the examples. But I can't figure out how to use maven to use the dl4j library in my own project. I tried to create a new project with maven but he doesn't recognize any methods or classes I try to use from dl4j 
solution: If you're newer to maven and intellij follow a tutorial or 2 and see what steps you're missing. 

issue: raver120: I gave absolute path like this: recordReader.initialize(new FileSplit("/home/vvinjamuri/Matlab/src/main/iris.txt".getFile)) . Is there any error with this? Should I use getAbsolutePath() method? Could some one help what is the error with this: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Is there any documentation on the ObjectMapper because I can't find the file on nd4j github? I want to convert a JSONObject to a DataSet so I can create a prediction. I did and it requires an ObjectMapper but I can't find what that ObjectMapper is supposed to do 
solution: 

issue: I am struggling with the reason why the numbers in the feature vectors contain negative numbers, when using the method getWordVector("word")f using word2Vec. Please help 
solution: 

issue: weegoh: and why not? any particular reason it can't have negative vector elements? it's initialized a uniform distribution, in -0.5...0.5 range / vector length 
solution: 

issue: If I get a JSONObject from another service, how can I give that input to my net and create a prediction. I thought it was with the predict() method but I'm not sure anymore 
solution: 

issue: "only cuDNN 5.1 is supported", is this still true or does 0.8 support v6? 
solution: so yes, this still true. 

issue: Ive installed cuDNN now. How do I know if deeplearning4j has picked up on that. Should anything be printed in the logs? The documentation does not state anything regarding this.@raver119 
solution: 

issue: Is there a way to not only save the net to a file but also the normalizer? I don't want to load the training data again just to fit the normalizer. 
solution: 

issue: Hi, i'm training a simple 2 FC layers net and an LSTM layer. On cuda. I'm monitoring GPU ram, and looks like it started at 1018 MB and now it's raising at 1722 MB and tells me it's out of device memory. Is it intended, or suspect a memory leak? 
solution:

issue: abholer: mind filing an !issue? I mean - we even have multi variate regression in our !examples I think we've told you multiple times to look there first foranything trbenne2: nothing there is dl4j specific I would consider maybe following a general maven intellij tutorial the only thing there that's dl4j specific is what dependencies to include alexberd: We can't help you based on anything you're telling us here Help us reproduce it in some way I mean - it could be your data pipeline when you use the model oranything 
solution: 

issue: dmmiller612: "is it necessary to run net.rnnClearPreviousState(); after each fitting? Or is that entirely for just prediction?"prediction only, and only when using rnnTimeStep. fit operations have state only for TBPTT, and that\'s manually cleared/handled for you alexberd: really all there is to it: save updater state, then load updater state if you need to continue training 
solution: 

issue: are you using nesterov momentum by any chance? 
solution: there was a bug  in nesterov state (all other updaters were ok). but wasn't being serialized properly (as it wasn't using a view of the state array). 

issue: zm2417: are you using eclipse? 
solution: switch to intellij then.. eclipse is known for issues with classpath. or launch your app from cmd line. but not from eclipse.. 

issue: By the way, i'm experimenting with a large matrix calculation, and nd4j didnt utilize all of my available GPU, it only uses one out of my 4 gpu. [<-LINK->] is the're a setting that i need to know or did not notice?

issue: back before i totally washed my computer to do dl4j i was building a website so i had port 80 and 25 for http and email forwarded to my computer. sinse i restored my computer im on DHCP now and i deleted the port forwarding in my router anyway i have windows defender thats it should i try to just delete everything and git clone mvn clean install intellij import again? 
solution: in th dl4j-examples pom i changed the dependency to <artifactId>deeplearning4j-ui_2.10</artifactId> to try to get it to work i think before it was like@scala(something) idk if that could be a problem. 

issue: agibsonccc: Hmm... That page is loading jquery twice? copypasteearth: Just checked.  Changing the scala version (in the wrong place) doesn't seem to do change anything.  (Since we are using Java in dl4j-examples) 
solution: 

issue: hello@agibsonccc, I have stock market time series data and am applying sliding window with size 20 which corresponds to 20 trades sequentially. The problem is for each step I create another dataset with shape [1,36,20]  after that use IteratorDataSetIterator to make [128,36,20] batch data and feed it to the LSTM-RNN. This cause too many object creation and takes a lot of time. Is there a way to make sliding window approach more efficient way 
solution: 

issue: i have some errors in my parent folder pom 
solution: 

issue: i totally reinstalled everything and im thinking its because im using dependency nd4j-native-platform because i have an intel(R) Graphics card and i dont have CUDA. What do you think? 
solution: 

issue: wq7278: does your UIExample work correctly because i don have a CUDA GPU either but when i try the example i dont get any graphs i just get the text and all the feilds say "loading" check this out it has pictures of what I'm getting with UIExample  I was told there should be graphs in that example [<-LINK->] I tried a bunch of other UI examples too and there all the same thing those images like that the whole web page that's the errors in the UI web console too I was reading around and people advise to install a web server something about // running localhost from file// that jquery wont load so I'm going to give it a shot no luck with the web server all ive been doing is trying to get it to work I tried it out of the box and those images is what I get the actual models and everything runs fine im going to fresh install again 
solution: 

issue: Is there a way to reduce CPU load when using CUDA backend? I am running a RNN encoder and found gpu load is really low while all CPU core are running close to 80%. e.g. reduce number of blas threads. But I expect this will also hurt performance, right? BTW, I am using ND4J 0.8.0

solution: 

issue: Hi guys, I was wondering what any best practices are for deploying a model. There's a lot of information on scalable solutions for training models, however, almost nothing on using the trained models. I was thinking of building a scalable webservice with Vert.x and Zookeeper, since that's what I'm comfortable with. But I'd like to know if there are other best practices. 
solution: I was just thinking maybe there could be some reuse of the already scalable spark framework DL4J has. But I'm not sure if it has any advantage in applying it in this case.. 

issue: Hi, does anyone know if there are openmp libraries pre-built for armv7? I can compile all sources with clang-omp but at link time, I need to link to the libraries for ios-armv7 and I can't find them easily. In order to run dl4j on ios, we need a static libnd4j and libjnind4j to be static libraries with omp references compiled into those libaries

issue: Hi. I am exploring options for implementing NLP and what various capabilities are. I came across DL4J and while the website goes into detail explaining what systems it will not work with, it does not say what is does work with. Does DL4J plug into the Apache UIMA framework? I see it uses ClearTK, which does integrate into the Apache UIMA. Can I infer that DL4J can be configured to work with the Apache systems?

issue: agibsonccc: ok thanks i was training a word2vec with a 40meg dictionary and intellij just shut down and my computer went to sleep even though i had it set never sleep. It happened on about the 50th epoch i was trying 100 epochs 20 iterations. Now im trying 20 epochs 10 iterations to get to save the model without a crash or whatever. Do you think 100 or even 20 epochs is too much?

solution: 

issue: 0.13.15 is using some new library for dependency resolution/downloading.  so that's most likely the problem. there's two -s in the nd4j dependency Did you run it with mvn? or java -jar?

issue: Tutorial says word2vec can run on Spark.  Does it accept RDD as input or do I need to pass in an RDD implementing SentenceIterator interface? 
solution: calvinzhan: there's a separate word2vec on spark implementation. 

issue: AlexDBlack: thank you for the explanations before. My main problem is that I want to use EarlyStopping with a dataset that is previously normalized using NormalizeStandardize. Because EarlyStoppingTrainer class only accepts DataSetIterator as a parameter, I cannot provide my normalize DataSet to it. AlexDBlack: thank you! List<DataSet> iteratorList = Collections.singleton(myDataSet); ExistingDataSetIterator myIterator = new ExistingDataSetIterator(iteratorList); Is is correct? 
solution: 

issue: I got illegalstateexception indarray <1 when trying to use my word2vec. what does that mean? is it because of a blank line in the file I trained the word2vec with? i will in like an hour I'm running a program right now sorry haha tried to use my own word2vec with cnnsentenceclassificationexample and i got this error any advice?

solution: 

issue: RNNs are especially good for time sequence data, but can even be used for binary analysis, like Shin et al for finding function boundaries.

solution: getting a lower end Maxwell could be enough. 

issue: damianoporta: you should take at least the 1060 6GB, as the 3GB version is both memory limited (which can be a big problem for nlp, depending on how you encode your data) and uses a slower core than the 6GB version. But honestly, you should first figure out how much memory you are going to need, as your training will be a lot faster if you don't have to move stuff over pcie all the time. 
solution: 

issue: DanPederEriksen: can't offer much to say except that's part of the process :) if you read the literature (i.e. browse arxiv.org and github.com) you'll find lots of hyperparameters that others have used successfully, and adapt them you also may need a learning rate schedule on it !tuning

issue: Something i am struggling to understand ... splitting implies that I will have to first load the whole data into memory. Then, I won't have the convience of loading a minibatch of data at a time, using it to train and then forget about it as in the case of using a DatasetIterator. Is that correct? 
solution: Then I can use that as a quick solution.. 

issue: What\'s the best way to debug ND4J INDAArray mismatches? I\'m getting a "java.lang.IllegalStateException: Mis matched lengths: [5120] != [6400]" when I use my ComputationGraph\'s .fit() function 
solution: Use arrays.shape() to see dimensions. Check your dataset dimensions. 

issue: Hi, I have problem getting labels out of ParagraphVector after I load it from disk. I use WordVectorSerializer.readParagraphVectors. It reads the labels, but it deod not seem to store it anywhere. At least, I cannot get them out.I wrote my own implementation of this method, where I create LablelSource and add it to the Build(). But I am not sure if I am doing it right and don't miss something that is already in the code. @tezer it should be there, just additional symbol exists at each lineNot sure, I understand you, @raver119 ...Could you give an example on how I can get the labels from the loaded model?  Right after training I get it with vec.getLabelsSource().getLabels(); But it  does not work with loaded model. 
solution: raver119: ,extractLabels()is called in theWordVectorSerializer.readParagraphVectors, but it changes nothing for me. Once I get thevectorsloaded, how do I get the labels?.

solution: 

issue: Hey: I've got a ComputationGraph that makes no progress. Speficially I'm using an EarlyStoppingTrainer that allows 4 iterations with no progress. It does exactly 4 iterations and then stops saying the best epoch was epoch -1. The resulting net predicts NaN for all outputs (output is softmax). I did some experiments in Python with the same data and Keras/TensorFlow so I know that there's a lot to be learned from this data and with this exact NN architecture. I also have some unit tests and things which I think ensure I am actually sending data to the network, etc. I'm not really sure how to debug this. Any ideas?? I added an EarlyStoppingListener and the reported score on each epoch is NaN so clearly something is very wrong, but I can't figure out what.

solution: 

issue: 0 
solution: 

issue: If I understand correctly instead of the only last time step, it's a vertex that stacks every time step into a matrix. The attention mechanism then learns some weights for each row and sums them up into a single vector. Gavxn: I'm still not sure why you are sorting Syn0.  Can't you use getRow()? 
solution: 

issue: I'm struggling withNd4j.sortWithIndices(lookup_table.getSyn0().norm2(0), 0, false);. The indices are all 0. I'm trying to get the index for the glossary I think I found a way. I iterate over the glossary, useindexOf(String word)to get the indices of my words, then usegetWordVector(String word) for the vectors for my words. I then build a map from these two.

solution: 

issue: SparkWord2Vec, but keep in mind, it's not polished enough yet, so general availability wasn't announced yet :( wellingtonfoz: so, now we're sure it's split. 
solution: 

issue: raver119: since it is not available using sparkdl4jlayer with one hidden layer, stochastic gradient for optimization and softmax for output layer would help proceed. Would that work ? 
solution: no ideas, i hadn't ever thought of reimplementing something that works.. Would negative sampling help in dealing with vocab size. So not all probabilities are calculated each time. 

issue: wellingtonfoz: AlexNet with 5000 images: way too many parameters relative to the amount of data (unless you're using transfer learning)and no - it's not 'normal', but it does happen. Suggests tuning issues (learning rate, etc) or normalization. Might happen with severe overfitting too(I only scanned the earlier discussion, apologies if that's been mentioned already)!tuning lower score = less error, yes.hard to say in general if it's good or not - it depends on sequence length and loss function you can look at the mathematical form of the loss function, and plug in numbers (for equal probabilities, or predict all 0s for regression, etc) to get a baseline value to compare to

solution: yes - I'd love to get to it, just so much other stuff going onI'll be getting out a tuning guide probably before that (again, as time allows :)). 

issue: So, in EarlyStoppingConfiguration, there is this method called scoreCalculator() that scores using model snapshot at each epoch. That probably doesn't use threads, right? and that is probably for the same reason we just discussed

issue: raver119:  [<-ISSUE->] I tried to do optimalization as you suggested but instead of helping to lower  memory consumption it raised by another 5-8G. I tried to remove splitting of dataset and storing it during epoch as you noted and moved logic of splitting on layer where only urls are there. Also I tried to do a little bit of preprocess of image only once (I did it once per epoch previously) and it made problem worse. What I was expecting is, that when I am loading all the images into memory it will take maximally 4G of memory not 20G so still i am not sure what is the biggest memory consumer. Also during all of the optimalization time spend on each epoch didn't lowered. If you could help me a little bit more I would really appreciate that, because I am starting to be a bit depressed. I would like to get it into bound of 16G for whole computing at least, or I would like to have good explanation why it is consuming so much.

Let's say there were 100000 records and needed to predict the 0 or 1 instead of putting random values in the first column. 
solution: raver119: basically once the scores output looks good then using that linear classifier as an example, one could then have a file with only the 2 input val columns and using the net model then predict values?. 

issue: hi@raver119.. i m back..so I copy paste error message here..I make use of JSON files to setup PV options(GSON library that I have also updated)  [<-LINK->] basically the Builder is built and initialized using JSON options oks.. let me find parts  [<-LINK->] that part get the builder and setup iterator etc and build ok  [<-LINK->]

issue: Hey! when I am using IntelliJ to generate the jar for my project with nd4j dependencies, but when I go and execute the jar, it doesnt contain the dependencies, anyone know a solution?? DanPederEriksen: I am using maven inside IntelliJ, but I can't find a solution :( DanPederEriksen: Yes, thank you, I've already visited and tried all the first google page with that search and 20 more, any better ideas? DanPederEriksen: Mate, thanks for such polite responses, I've been searching for solutions for 6 hours before commenting here, yes I've read everything from that post at least three times, couldn't find an  answer. Obviously I am doing something wrong that does not appear there because it might be so obvious they just don't mention it. Thank you for your help Bye bye 
solution: 

issue: I've obviously got my dims mixed up, as there is thousands of rows in dataset 3797 rows in dataset. any ideas why they are not being picked up? batchsize=1, that is why. when I comment out shuffle, I get this: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot split DataSet with <= 1 rows (data set has 1 example) is that due to batch size?

issue: Hi. Getting 'Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Can't allocate [DEVICE] special buffer memory!' on Ubuntu, GTX 750, on Cuda 8. Using DL4J .80. Any ideas? raver119:  [<-LINK->] how much memory should my GPU have? i mean how much min GPU memory is recommened? ok thank you. Is there any way to check out much GPU memory is being allocated to dl4j and cublas? 
solution: 

issue: 77jayron: you may want to check out the nvidia-smi tool if you are using linux. This will give you runtime memory usage on your GPU it won't run on windows though 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I wrote a custom activation function that extends BaseActivationFunction, but when running, inside the function getActivation(INDArray in, boolean training) I got messy data in the parameter "in".for network model training  I use net.fit(dataSet); do I need to transform DataSet to *Iterator or other types? Yes, I read the code, and my activation function can run okay with net.fit(DataSetIterator), but when I change to dataset, it doesn't work the code also runs okay with "tanh" but after change to custom activation function it doesn\'t work ok, I will paste the code, thanks 
solution: 

issue: angrySCV: sadly no..it's on our list chunyu66: Have you see this: [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] I'm not sure that has anything to do with the activation function o_0 Maybe your dataset is just assembled wrong? Mind showing us a stack trace via !gist?

issue: Hi guys, I'm trying to figure out how I can read my input data into DL4J directly from SQL - currently I am running the SQL manually and exporting to CSV and using the CSVRecordReader, but I want to automate the process, any suggestions? I was thinking I could populate a CollectionRecordReader with my SQL output but the javadoc says that's mainly for testing, so is that a bad idea? 
solution: 

issue: So, with dl4j version 0.8.0, i get this issue while building the app:                                                                                                Error:Execution failed for task ':app:transformClassesWithDexForDebug'.com.android.build.api.transform.TransformException: com.android.ide.common.process.ProcessException: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: com.android.dex.DexException: Too many classes in --main-dex-list, main dex capacity exceeded This did not occur with version 0.7.2

solution: 

issue: hi, I am getting the error message like "Requested INDArray shape [0, 100] contains dimension size values < 1 (all dimensions must be 1 or more)" I am using the example of ParagraphVectorClassifierExample. It works with original datset but not my corpora... raver119: Thank you. is there anyways that I can skip the error?

issue: I don't have a MAC (on Windows). And I've got the geforce 1080 ti card with onboard video disabled my error was from maven if I move to version 0.8.0 of nd4j & dl4j, no such error. Only on the new 0.8.1-SNAPSHOT. Weird... 
solution: 

issue: new error on the 0.8.1-SNAPSHOT: Exception in thread "Thread-8" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/nd4j/shade/jackson/core/JsonProcessingException adding jackson-core v2.9.0.pr3 to maven does not help

issue: git clone [<-LINK->] is not working. It gives following error: index-pack failed. The remote end hung up unexpectedly. 
solution: 

issue: also: define "not working". I\'m guessing it\'s just a network issue perhaps? that's about the only thing that can go wrong yep, nothing to do with dl4j. that's network related or maybe a problem with github itself 
solution: 

issue: Look I understand that to use that snapshot I just need to change my pom file. But I can also compile from source, can't I? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: Yes I am using nd4j-native-platform using maven build from linux and deploy on linux spark. For openblas i just meant the jar from maven build 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I yesterday run learning of net with -Xms2g and -Xmx6g and if failed after 3 hours with this exception: [<-LINK->] I have snapshot of 0.8.1 
solution: you’re feeding nn with individual batches. just wrap your iterator into AsyncDataSetIterator(iterator, 3, true) options. 

issue: AlexDBlack: I did that. still getting the error. this is my spark command and list of dependencies am passing in.  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: raver119: any news about the wordsnearest problem? It seems strange that such a basilar function of the library doesn't work How? Are you able to obtain the right results by running my code? 
solution: I mean, I can't obtain nothing from the paper. This should mean that the new models just aren't useful and lost one of the main advantages of w2v. This is improbable imho. 

issue: My neural network score has very jagged flip-flopping going up and down, I'm using RMSPROP with a decay of 0.95 and 0.010 learn rate.

solution: 

issue: raver119: Only paraller wrapper is in version 0.7.2 and everything else is in version 0.8.0. At start 1 bach took 43 minutes now its around 2 hours. 
solution: 

issue: I think I know why it's slow I'm seeingOut of [DEVICE] memory, host memory will be used instead: deviceId: [0], requested bytes: [432340992] In my other log 
solution: time to meet workspaces i think. 

issue: No I'm not. I can't post my code sadly. What would that do? Also I'll be back in 20 minutes something just popped up raver119: I've noticed 0.9.0 is not on Maven yet 
solution: besides of macos - things work out of box. 

issue: raver119: I reverted back to 0.7.2 and now I get missing dependencies error when I execute allowMultiGpu(true). My dependencies: core, nlp, api, parallel-wrapper and cuda 8 platform. raver119: libraryDependencies += "org.deeplearning4j" % "deeplearning4j-core" % "0.7.2"libraryDependencies += "org.deeplearning4j" % "deeplearning4j-nlp" % "0.7.2"libraryDependencies += "org.nd4j" % "nd4j-api" % "0.7.2"libraryDependencies += "org.nd4j" % "nd4j-cuda-8.0-platform" % "0.7.2"libraryDependencies += "org.deeplearning4j" % "deeplearning4j-parallel-wrapper" % "0.7.2" 
solution: you just need to have cuda backend first probably. because CudaEnvironment bean exists only in cuda backend.

issue: raver119: hi. I've followed [<-LINK->] example to save offline training data for UI display. But is it expected that each iteration takes approximately twice as much time when I usemodel.setListeners(new IterationTimeListener(1), new StatsListener(statsStorage), new ScoreIterationListener(1));instead ofmodel.setListeners(new IterationTimeListener(1), new ScoreIterationListener(1));? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: ,  can i use spark clustering on GPU using deeplearning4j? i have a program written based on spark mllib libary,  i wonder it can run on gpu+cpu under the help of deeplearing4j framework? have resolved  it seems deeplearning4j already have the kmeans cluster you means i do not need to change any existed spark code ? 
solution: Have you used cuda before on a single node?. 

issue: raver119: I did the tests with the python library Results are ok. Both the library returns almost the same nearest neighbours, either calling the method on a single word, either by positive/negative method. There are some strang ethings btw 1) the DL4J method returns always the words you insert as the most near. For example if you call wordsNearest("Italy",5) you\'ll get "Italy" as the first occurrence. This is verified with all the words.2) for some words the results are completely different. For example "Java" in the python libraries returns as results some words that reconduct to the Java Island. In the DL4J Library "Java" returns Oracle and programming related words. This is the only case that I\'ve found so far. Also it is curious that this doesn\'t happen if you submit "java" without the first letter capitalized: in that case both the libraries will return the same words. In the end if you do "Java-coffee" in the python library you will be able to obtain the same results of "Java" by the DL4J btw it is confirmed: the properties exposed in your page (such as Libray-Books) can't be otbained at all, probably due to model changes. If you could provide the model that gave those results I could investigate this better

issue: DonaldAlan: not much beyond naming convention :( 
solution: 

issue: hello,what should I do with this problem?  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: If I want to train a network for function approximation, and I want to be able to use a dynamically generated dataset, should I use an INDArray with the pre-generated data, or should I extend the DatasetIterator and Dataset classes to have it continually generate the data during the training? I may need too many examples to be able to store it in an array (unless INDArray has some way to offload the data to storage when not in use). 
solution: Garan105: both approaches are reasonableI'd lean towards implementing your own DataSetIterator thoughjust use DataSet as is - no need to modify/extend that. 

issue: why need a uber jar? basically using jsut the word2vec serailizer to load a glove file into mem and do lookups ?  not running the training 
solution: vybs: 1 class source to load from. You're also vastly underestimating the complexity of clashing dependencies and transitive dependencies. 

issue: Hey,I tried over a week now to implement anomaly detection via different auto encoder implementations. I have different categories of cron jobs with different characteristics. My input vector looks like this: 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2500, 0, 12 or 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 20. The first 5 values are the one-hot encoded category. The other three values are characteristics of the different jobs (for some job types higher values are normal and for other low values are normal). When I use the only input for one job type, it looks promising. As soon as I try to detect five different job types it isn't working. I use a training set with 200.000 items and for every job type I use nearly the same amount of entries. Do you have any idea, why my auto encoder can't detect these difference (I have a score of around 0.3)? 
solution: 

issue: well, when in the training is this? at the start or the end? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: hi! Your library uses the Skipgram algorythm, that have problems with recognizing multiple words, right?

issue: The problem is I have to finish it this weekend for my thesis and keras would not install for me on Win10 with GPU. DL4J was working out of the box and has much better debugging, but still I have to kickstart my model:D 
solution: If you look at our Variational Auto Encoder implementation, it's kind of like a network inside a network.. 

issue: uccollab: sure! That's great to hear! Just try to make less assumptions next time :D

issue: Than how do you make pretty graphs about test performance after each epoch? Ok so I can do evaluate but not in Listener. So basically cannot do it like every iteration only at epoch end THanks 
solution: 

issue: telling the library implementors what a bug is with their own library isn't how you get us to help you my friend just cooperate and post the gist please it's not a hard thing to do 
solution: there's tons of places where state is highly sensitive or not obvious. 

issue: As a work-around to using parallelWrapper, I have tried to start two separate java Arbiter executables using the same GPU (as it has spare capacity). While the first-to-start works as expected, the second seems to block after the runner starts. Is there any way to make that work? 
solution: but in that case it should throw you an exception. 

issue: already disabled on second code (as it would not run until I did)- should I disable on both? 
solution: 

issue: Is it better to use 2 merge Vertex that have 1 output each, or to use 1 merge Vertex that has 2 outputs ? (I'm feeding 2 inputs and trying to get 2 outputs)There you go (can't put it directly right here don't know why)http://imgur.com/hU5LcNr Left one even if I want the outputs at t-1 to be the inputs at t ? I made 2 mistakes in the picture : L1 and L2 are LSTMs (it's a recurrent nn actually), and I should've put them after the merge instead of before sorry about that 
solution: 

issue: i can't find any good examples right now, but it would be like this array.reshape(1,1,40,8) ? 
solution: so InputType in your neural net should be appropriately. you were working with RecordReader infrastructure. so you shouldn’t need jvm arrays. 

issue: ok, but i dont know how, if you would look into my code in my first post, im reading my csv file into 2d float array and then i crating indarray from it 
solution: INDArray array = Nd4j.create(dataVec); and it is creating 2d array.

solution: 

issue: any support on attention based layers? marcel-93: features not present in training should be discarded. 
solution: usually if it comes up at a customer we implement it, and when we do implement layers we usually do a survey of best in class and implement only the "good one". 

issue: ok thank you, maybe I'll file  feature request. marcel-93: if you need to add features, you have to retrain the net. Usually most frequent and most important words are quite common in fairly big datasets, so very rare words are not useful. If train dataset lacks some important feature, it's a bad train dataset and is not representative of the population. 
solution: 

issue: marcel-93: looks useful! mind filing a doc !issue? A quick few lines is all we'd need Thanks a lot! thanks! we'll label it thanks heh 
solution:

issue: hi@raver119.. coming back to my goal of incorporating lexicon sentiment to words embeddings while performing doc2vec..  what do you think about idea of training word vectors and then change polarity of lexicon words only to be +1  or -1, and then run PV's for some iterations .. idea is more or less explained in the paper I copy/paste here yesterday. ;) would you pre-train word vectors with word2vec first? or simply run PV(w/  word embeddings) for few iterations, adjust components (+1, -1) for lexicon words and then run PV for another iteration or so..? 
solution: 

issue: can deeplearning4j run without a GPU? i mean using only CPU power 
solution: 

issue: issue [<-ISSUE->] . I have a function that reads pdf and outputs text. SentenceIterator only reads a single file. But, here I have many pdf files. and could not use FileDocumentIterator. Also I could not pass SentenceIterator each time to word2vec.builder() function..@raver119 oh.. you mean I should convert pdf to type LabelledDocument but not String, and then pass the LabelledDocument to LabelledDocumentIterator to be used in builder function.. am I on right path 
solution: 

issue: so would it be a more efficient method for me at this time to run 16 threads training 16 different nets?  (If my goal is to train multiple networks anyway) It does sound like a rather complex issue so I understand (Well, I don't fully understand, hence I understand it's not a trivial problem lol) 
solution: we've already spent lots of time working on 8gpu box. and we're not 100% done yet..

issue: Could you give a link to show how to train LSTM network on more than one million samples? In demos I notice that all samples are loaded at once into the memory. Actually I want to find out how to do with the data iterator.@AlexDBlack 
solution: yeah, and most examples definitelydon'tload all data into memory. 

issue: raver119: when I pass LabelAwareIterator variable in builder, it shows the error "The method iterate(DocumentIterator) in the type Word2Vec.Builder is not applicable for the arguments (LabelAwareIterator)" Its not an error thrown during runtime, but a compilation error.. 
solution: 

issue: Hi@raver119I have been few days away. I still have problem with memory usage even when I am using separate workspace withNd4j.getMemoryManager().setAutoGcWindow(2500);and batch size of 5 (224x224x3)Is there some special way to specify memory limits? When I use -Xmx4g it eats all of my 8G of memory and is sigkilled by oomkiller. When I set -Xmx to 3g it fails with out of memory error. AlexDBlack: @raver119when I set Xmx to 4g and -Dorg.bytedeco.javacpp.maxbytes to 4g it could take 8g or 4g? raver119:  [<-LINK->] I set maxbytes to 4G and if I understand exception correctly, it means that 4G offheap is not enough, because it failed in allocation of memory. Am I right? 
solution: 

issue: papperwing: what model you're trying to run there? well, that's somewhat expensive model yes. 
solution: 

issue: RuralHunter: Welcome! Here's a link to Deeplearning4j's Gitter Guidelines, our documentation and other DeepLearning resources online. Please explore these and enjoy! [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: so in previous version, I moved the data loading bits inside the actual loop to generate networks hoping GC would bin the old stuff per loop... So now I should take it outside and reuse the same stuff? 
solution: 

issue: @raver119 I have tried to fiddle the memory parameters and I got into phase where probably whole epoch was computed and in the end when evaluation is counted it failed.https://gist.github.com/papperwing/9456ce2a9d332d845949a5363a6550d8 
solution: that sums up to 3.7gb alone.. 

issue: Quick Question ... are there any mechanisms for automatic data normalization in dl4j ? Just wondering ... 
solution: 

issue: COA1IMB: check out !examples dl4j-examples nearly every example uses normalization COA1IMB:  [<-LINK->] Today@AlexDBlackcommited a change in BasicDataVecExample. There he changed the method for getting the path from getParent to getAbsolutePath so the stringname "directory" is imo wrong now and could lead to misunderstanding. Should be changed to "path" or something like that.deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples@658df47 
solution: 

issue: raver119: just gathering some data for GPU memory usage I keep day dreaming and missing epochs and have to start again haha I'm not experienced enough to be able to help you on this matter I'm afraid, sorry! 
solution: 

issue: Im not sure if this is the right place to do ask this, but im unsure how to create a Convulation Neural Network. I have tried using the Mnist Example and changing it to my needs, but thats not working, as only goes over one iteration, lever learns anythings and only giving the same answer for any input. The input i have is a  391 samples of (32*100) Flat array and output is out of 3 options. Also i would like to say that the score at that single iteration is NaN, not sure if this is an issue. Can anyone guide me in the right direction? 
solution: 

issue: no way. Shape of INDArray is immutable, so you’ll have to create new INDArrays by using Nd4j.stack/pile/concat etc Alcalol: yes, it runs faster, allows to disable gc, and uses less ram in most cases. as for EarlyStoppingParallelTraining - file an !issue please, i hadn’t looked into it it might require some additional tweaks like those applied to regular pw nah, no chance it’s just i hadn’t look into it there’s one more thing about workspaces btw... it’s not covered in guide yet, not sure how i can explain it properly 
solution: for better perf etc. and now it’s also the way how workspaces work with any iterators out there. 

issue: Upon reading the source for EarlyStoppingParallelTrainer, I believe it does not use workspaces in the parallelWrapper of that class... Am I correct?   Side note is that everything else is using workspaces now and it does appear to be much much more stable memory wise and actually runs somewhat faster. in fact amazingly it uses less and less memory over time! 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I have a question about an error I get. So I am trying to build my program upon dl4j-example/BasicCSVClassifer class and I am getting this error - "input size is invalid: does not match layer input size". What does this mean? 
solution: 

issue: Im getting an issue, it looks like my model is not learning anything at all. While in training it keeps logging ScoreIterationListener - Score at iteration 0 is NaN. Not sure why this is happening. Is it an issue if the training data has very large negative numbers? Will this effect the learning? Sorry, ill rephrase then. I cant see any points about the input of model having negtaive numbers in the document. I understand that the output should be defined as [1,0,0] but im not sure if any data normialztion should be happening on the input side. Sorry agibsonccc: Hmm, thanks! I start with that. And one more question, does deeplearning4j have its own methods to normalize data, or should i write my own. Im quite new to do this. So already thanks for your help!

issue: hi@tamervimocgood question. I have the same problem when training a model for the NOAA sea lion classification competition on kaggle. I have trained a pretty accurate model, I just need to now apply a sliding window on the test images (which are between 1000x1000 and 4k, so I get know what youre talking about. But I had another question for the community, Is it possible to get a screen window output ? Much like in opencv for python where you can get  a window output. Alright so because your problem was correlated with mine I did some research on both. It seems that for object detection on video (in your case) and recording window output (in my case), you want to use the Opencv for Java. [<-LINK->] I just imported with maven and did some face recognition and it seems to work pretty well. So start with JavaCV and the OpenCv docs and examples 
solution: 

issue: Sciss: no examples for audio signal processing or handwriting recognition with DL4J that I'm aware of sethah: again, open an issue. Your approach sounds fineas to the UI - I haven't seen any issues with worker selection before. Again - need an issue with details :)

issue: hi,guys, are there any strategy to solve the multi-label classification problem in deeplearning4j? 
solution: yan24639916: use sigmoid with binary xent. you just add more 1s for classes it can also be. 

issue: Im planing on getting started with the DL4j book coming out soon, will it cover any Scala material? And what is the status of the Keras API for Scala? Hehe sure, im glad there is starting to come alternatives outside of Python im sick of Tensorflow and Python If you would compare DL4j with Tensorflow how feature compatable are they except for the autodiff? I mostly interested in RL with RNN yes but TF has the contrib and now also keras layers 
solution: Well, all in due respect, but my machine is rendering a "real product" right now using TF.. 

issue: no 2.12 support yet? 
solution: you can build it with that support if you want, you can largely blame spark for that. 

issue: I just played a little bit using the AnimalClassifier CNN... after some hours I got it trained... Now I want to use the net in an nother application for classification.... Is there a possibility to restore the label names somehow? yes... I know... printed them out after evaluation phase... the order will be the same I suppose? but they are not stored in the serialized network... ok The order of label names in rr.getLabels() and output array correspond? 
solution: if you save the model just setup the recordreader and look at the labels and print them out. 

issue: hey can someone help me import my Caffee model to DL4J? I understand it has to go through the keras import library 
solution: 

issue: yan24639916: first: use !gist for configurations like that, it's much easier to read and won't crop your messages second: there's lots of things that can cause that, including !tuningand of course if there are issues with your data pipeline (i.e., labels aren't either 0 or 1 for all values)

I could take a look if I had a way of reproducing it tanh is still the most common in practice.in principleit'll work to some degree, but I haven't seen any literature doing a thorough comparison 
solution: 

issue: mostafaalishahi: that's likely the causeit may not necessarily be something you can fix on your end, depending on the cause... if it's failing on loading, it suggests the json produced during saving is invalid... we may be able to implement a fix for that (escaping the characters, for example), if we are able to reproduce itcould you open an !issue with some details? even better (and possibly necessary) would be something we can run to reproduce the problem marcel-93: great, thanks.

solution: 

issue: Am I right in thinking it's abnormal (as in I did something wrong) that a classification model after training produces predictions that are not whole numbers like [0, 1, 0] but rather like [0.75, 0.18, 0.16]? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: Thank you for your response :)...no, I'm not running in to an issue, just wanted to see if this kind of configuration can help me improve my results in comparison with the configuration from dl4j example. I assumed that adding a Bidirectional LSTM layer(s) could be a good way to improve my classification results 
solution: gjossep: i think this could help you [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Im getting NAN as the score with scoreiterationlistener does tha mean it has learned the best it could? I changed up the EncoderDecoderLSTM example to take a small corpus i just woke up and about half of the scoreiterations are NAN Its at about the 537th epoch right now Thanks@AlexDBlack

issue: I'm training Doc2Vec on a computer with 64GB RAM and I always get out of memory errors. However, if I train the same model on Gensim I only need around 17GB of memory. Is there some reason why DeepLearning4j needs so much memory for training compared to Gensim? I might though be doing something wrong, but I have the same parameter settings as ParagraphVectorsTextExample.java but with 300 layers and 5 as minWordFrequency. I have around 16.000.000 passages that my model trains on.

issue: Hi everyone, I am usingdl4j-examples/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/recurrent/word2vecsentiment/Word2VecSentimentRNN.javain order to make a sentiment analysis but using my dataset and in a non English language,  the number of files are the same as this example 25k for positive reviews and 25k for negative, the only difference is that i do not have any imdbEr.txt and imdb.vocab files in my dataset.the problem is that i am getting  bad scores in each iteration , do you think that the problem is with my data or with imdbEr.txt and imdb.vocab that i do not have it? or something else is wrong?here is the result of running the Word2VecSentimentRNNhttps://gist.github.com/mostafaalishahi/0c218e1a5381b11332c21bcda50ed0e9the real example's scores are so high those are about 0.8611484060813637 more or less.can you please tell me1- why it is killing the iteration?2- do i need to make my vocab files like there exist in the example?Can anyone help me?

issue: mostafaalishahi: That's strange. I can't tell anything more from the log. Is it reproducible? Can you turn up the logging level from INFO and see what it says? 
solution: 

issue: Ok and how can I load them for training? I did almost same but with CustomSerializer. Problem in my case is that off heap memory is not cleaned after image is saved in file. Will this presave solve this problem with cleaning the offheap?

issue: papperwing: going to quickly fill in here, you said you're using snapshots right? 
solution: crockpotveggies: In fact I didn't said that and I am sorry that I didn't mentioned that.. no worries, if raver mentioned to use workspaces I was able to figure that out very quickly :). 

issue: hi, when I run the following example by copy and paste the codes into my java compiler after several training iterations it gives me the "Killed " message but when I use clone dl4j-examples it works fine. and also i checked already that i missed a jar file for nd4j. can you tell me what is going wrong?dl4j-examples/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/recurrent/word2vecsentiment/Word2VecSentimentRNN.java

issue: crockpotveggies: So your suggestion is to totally remove async wrapper around DataSetIterator? For me its not a problem :) 
solution: crockpotveggies: yes!!. 

issue: johnjamin11: re: W2V/paragraph vectors: afaik you can't change the activation function, loss function or optimizeractivation function I could kinda see working; loss function isn't changeable (think negative sampling and the like) and for such a shallow net, I'm not sure how important the optimizer is (I think the only option there is adagrad or not?) 
solution: 

issue: anybody give a feedback for [<-ISSUE->] ? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: AH thank you a lot. Problem was probably caused by misplaced replacement of layer which was meant for different model. I fixed the naming of frozen layer and naming of replaced layer and now it learns I would like to ask, when I want to load fileStatStorage later and I want to visualize statistics what will be process of loading that? Is there some example for this? And another question, if I don't want to connect to this running application I probably dont need UIServer do I? 
solution: shopuld be used dl4j-ui-model as is described in spark because of conflict?. 

issue: papperwing: Is it easy to reproduce in a few lines of code? If so, please post an issue, I'd like to see if there isn't a general way to work around that 
solution: AlexDBlack: Usage of J7StatListener and J7FileStatsStorage didn't help. I will try to set everything to J8 and I will try it with normal Storage..

issue: gmollard: what GPU do you have? gmollard: That is a powerful card and it does have a lot of RAM.  Have you tried increasing the minibatch size? I do think there a couple of optimizations that are in SNAPSHOT that made things faster for the latest hardware. 
solution: Yes I know, I have to make benchmark its capabilities for deeplearning using Spark. And yes I increased the minibatch size a lot, but it still runs faster on CPU backend... 

issue: Hi, has anyone a working multi classifier RNN model with MCXENT/SOFTMAX and could give me some hints on initialization, activations and regularization stuff? I have weird phenomena that my model trains for number of iterations (40-60) and then all of the sudden score drops to 0 and remains like that. I havent done any normalization for labels so they are currently not multi-hot (0,0,0,1,0,1,0) but rather (0,0,0,4,0,5,0)  [<-LINK->] agibsonccc: Hi Mr Gibson, long time no talk, thanks for looking at it

solution: 

issue: wmeddie: Actually I'm using a single machine (so spark in local mode) for the benchmark but the idea is to extend to several machines when the interest of running the deeplearning on GPU will be proved. I did not find any warning in the logs about cudnn. Do you have any idea about which parameters could improve the performance on GPU ? Also, I working in a spark 1.6 environment. Is there a chance that the GPU implementation will run faster on spark 2.10 ? Thanks for your help by the way :) 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: @agibsoncccIs it possible to have a timeseries go in and for every timestep put it through an LSTM? Similar to how we use CNNs for timeseries. I want to generate embeddings for every timestep. Every timestep in itself is a sequence. So for example a sentence is a sequence of words, but the words are a sequence of characters. Right now I use a CNN for the second sequence. However, I would like to have a second LSTM instead of the CNN. AlexDBlack: Ok, thanks. Maybe I could try and come up with something. So how do you get it work with CNNs? Could you point me in the right direction? AlexDBlack: Ok, so I have experience with the preprocessors. I agree the masking would be the most difficult. Maybe I can get some inspiration from here [<-LINK->]

issue: is it require to install intelMKL and architectures towork with dl4j 
solution: earthat: no, MKL it completely optional. by default you'll use openblas (which is included with nd4j-native). if you do install MKL and make it available via system path - nd4j will link with it and use it. 

issue: how can I build dl4j examples using sbt in scala 
solution: youc an take what's there and adapt it if you want. 

issue: papperwing: looks like a problem with how you are building your JAR - missing resourcesunless this is with the (completely unmodified) examples? mostafaalishahi: well, if you installed everything from source (dl4j, datavec, nd4j, etc) then it's just a case of changig versions in the pom file

issue: Hi guys. I cloned Animal classification convolution network and i want to make a simple app "file -> prediction" without DataSetIterator and InputSplit and so on (with pre-trained model ofc). What I found is NativeImageLoader and i can simply get INDArray and call network.predict () with it but I\'ll get number of class. Should i save map "labelNumber -> labelName" by myself or there another approach for it? Please forgive me my English and noob question. 
solution: 

issue: how should i change the amount of RAM and cores of CPU used by your examples? AlexDBlack: because my data is kind of heavy. but I am running the examples using ./run-examples.sh and i can't use java -Xmx. I didn't get it if can i change the number of cores that cpu is using or no?

issue: I tried to run the  the MINST Example with Spark  and got the following error : Exception in thread "main" java.lang.VerifyError: class com.fasterxml.jackson.module.scala.ser.ScalaIteratorSerializer overrides final method withResolved.   Is anyone familiar with that ? agibsonccc: error is probably because I don't have scala binaries yet 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: yeah i use datavec heavily for joining features.csv and labels.csv via a join column and after that i do a transformprocess too.Imagine all my data would be one-hot encoded, do i even have to nomalize? imo not, because then tere would be only onesand zeros. 
solution: marcel-93: right, it\'d only be your "Euros" column that would need normalization. AlexDBlack: and normalization of euros would be done in datavec transform. 

issue: problem is: say you have 10 values, and not all of them appear in your test data or something(you might want to run the same process on different datasets - or even a single example - in isolation)  [<-LINK->] that might make things a bit easier/faster i.e., get inque values -> build the process from that

issue: AlexDBlack: May i ask you for help with solving nans? I added normalizer into RecordReader (I forget to put it there and I had it only in classifying part). My batchsize is only 5 so that probably will be bit problem. Also I would like to ask you about init of weights when performing transfer learning. I copied example because I am also using VGG and there is used special distribution claimed that it is performing better. That should be sufficient shouldnt be? Is there possibility, that I get different score then NaN after NaN appeared?

issue: When I am using EarlyStoppingTrainer, each iteration consist of training on one minibatch and testing on whole test set? I would like to ask how is EarlyStopping behaving. I tried earlyStopping on small dataset consisting of 100 images and after one epoch it started next one. Now I am running same code on 10k images and after first epoch it  is probably something doing, because it is holding 25g of memory but I don't have any output. After epoch it will use training data to estimate goodness of model? And it is not using feeding score listener during this phase? I am now waiting for half hour and still there is no change so I am starting to be bit nervous :)

issue: Question for anyone who may have an idea, I am trying to scale some features to have a similar number of dimensions to use with an RNN.  I pretty much have a time series dataset, with a price change, and a bunch of doc2vec features (100). I want to pass those into a RNN to try and forecast.  What would be the best way to scale those so the price change has a similar weight as all of those doc2vec features? Err... sorry dimensions, not features. It's late... 
solution: 

issue: The goal is to try and make a NN to predict if a stock will go up or down based on news headlines, and the price change between the current, and last step 
solution: so I have my vectors for the news by running those through doc2vec, I was just thinking that it seems like if I just added another single "column" to that INDArray with the price change, it would get totally missed out because so much "more" of the array is the headlines. 

issue: USCDataScience/dl4j-kerasimport-examples  this example is very cool to give an example to use load inceptionv3 model from keras, when i debug it , i find the flatten layer output is not same as tensorflow flatten output,   for tensorflow's output is all above 0, but it is not some feature < 0 also the predict result  is not as good as tensorflow but is quite close 
solution: 

issue: marcel-93: depends. you could implement your own custom preprocessor or normalizer, for examplebut if that needs statistics (min/max/mean etc) - you still need to do a full pass of the data if you are using ImageRecordReader (I assume you are) then it's always alphabetical

issue: raver119: Thank you. I can use ParallelWrapper at nd4j-cuda-8.0-platform now. 
solution: 

issue: Is it possible that training results can be different between CPU vs GPU?  When I train DL model using  image data set using CPU, the training accuracy is about 0.95. However, the accuracy becomes 0.75 if I use GPU. I used [<-LINK->] (and MultiGpuLenetMnistExample.java) to convert my program  to  use GPU. 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: ok so you meant instead  of org.deeplearning4j.text.tokenization.tokenizer  I should build my tokenizer in the character n-grams level and not in the word level, did i get it correctly? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: I have read those classes and interfaces i think the main change that i should do is in DefaultStreamTokenizer ;-)  , anyway I have spoken to Mikolov and he told me I can't mix up two languages in word2vec and build a model, but he didn't mention why. as you told I think because I need the character n-gram, am i right?

issue: Hi guys, I have some problems with using deeplearning4j on Jetson TX1. Cuda is installed on the board and arm64 image is flashed. Examples are running fine with native support, but I can not run with gpu one. I fill a bug report here - [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: about dl4j-kerasimport-examples on github: git tells me: "Error downloading dl4j-import-example/data/inception-model-weights.h5  This repository is over its data quota. Purchase more data packs to restore access." Any other way to get inceptionv3 weights? 
solution: 

issue: What do you mean by simple classifier?  I checked and I haven't seen no one using glove also in order to make a feature vectors from word for this task 
solution: 

issue: Hello!Can u please help me, I have a set of photos with different resolution: 12801280, 1000900 and others. But in configuration of VGG model i have to set width and height of image...  So How I can use ImageTransform to set resolutions of my pictures to the standart resolution? 
solution: papperwing: When i try to recognize image, i have an exception\'\'\'Exception in thread "main" org.deeplearning4j.exception.DL4JInvalidInputException: Input size (1555456 columns; shape = [1, 1555456]) is invalid: does not match layer input size (layer # inputs = 8192). 

issue: nbarskov: When you are looking and in which object you are looking at it? 
solution: nbarskov: And the lenght parameter you mentioned you have been watching in which moment and on which variable. My idea why you see the same lenght is that you are looking on original image or in wrong time. ImageRecordReader will transform image only when it is required. So when RR.next() is called INDArray is created from image and transform on that is performed. So transformed image will be in INDArray.  (Hope that I am right, otherwise developers please correct me). 

issue: thanks.. also.. i'm a little bit confused. maybe it stems from my lack of understanding of maven. But it seems like all I have to do to get a spark application with deeplearning4j up and going is to add the dependency in a pom file? it doesn't seem like I need to do any kind of installation unless i'm misssing something here... 
solution: would there happen to be any scala examples using deeplearning4j on spark? i noticed they all seem to be java :). 

issue: Error in load my CNN network : [<-LINK->] I use my version ofRnnToFeedForwardPreProcessor(calledMyRnnToFeedForwardPreProcessor) for converting the feature from Conv1D to FullConn. I use alsoModelSerializer.restoreMultiLayerNetwork(modelFilePath, true); agibsonccc: yes! [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Is there any way to use GPU without using ParallelWrapper?  [<-LINK->] (and MultiGpuLenetMnistExample.java) to convert my program to use GPU. I used [<-LINK->] (and MultiGpuLenetMnistExample.java) to convert my program to use GPU. But, I found performances between CPU vs GPU are too different. 0.95 for CPU vs 0.75 for GPU 
solution: 

issue: all: , Thank you so much for your comments. Now I understood how to set GPU and CPU in my program.

issue: Hi, i'm tryng to import a keras inception3 weights. I'm using keras 1.2.2 to save the model in h5 without json. At evaluation, got this error, any clue on how to solve? [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: AJku7: how would you expect that  to work exactly? it's not all in memory 
solution: 

issue: ok got it.one more thing with batch training the same samples are selected for each epoch?If different shuffling might not be needed. 
solution: 

issue: Does it work with labelMask at present?  Assuming I manually load into a DataSet? yeah, I can hack that. I don't know what is still outstanding though.  Does sample weight enter the gradient or not? I know how the sampling works. no I"m asking whether a fractional flaoting point labelsMask is equivalent to sample weight.  I..e. if I put in 0.5, it counts as half, or 2 it counts as twice, and enters the computation of the update and the optimization target. I know that is the alternative.  I would prefer to avoid doing that. My question is what is the status of the labelsMask and how deep does its value get propagated to updates. Sample weight = 0 doesn't enter in error target, sample weight = 1 does. What about 0.5, and 2.0? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I'm having a little trouble with the syntax on creating a shallow ANN, input nodes connected directly to output nodes just for a base comparison on an experiment, an output layer can't be there on its own, and if I add a dense layer I need to specify the hidden nodes. Any thoughts on this? I want a neural net without hidden layers thats what I meant I get an error if I do that

issue: good morning. trying to split a 3d DataSet read using CSVSequenceRecordReader (data: Rank: 3,Offset: 0Order: f Shape: [1,66,3832],  stride: [1,1,66]) into training and test sets but SplitTestAndTrain doesn't seem to work because it thinks it only has one element. I'm assuming it thinks it's a 2d set. What is the best way to split a 3d dataset? my code is different. what version is this? My data set: (data: Rank: 3,Offset: 0Order: f Shape: [1,66,3832], stride: [1,1,66]) 
solution: you can't split 1. well I have 3832 examples. 

issue: well my csv has 3832 lines, each is for a single day - I'm confused (and I've been reading your book and [<-LINK->] ) -do I need to read the data differently? [<-LINK->] 
solution: Yes single file with labels. so a single file for each day? does not make sense. your SingleTimestepRegressionExample use a single file. 

issue: The framework architecture is not limiting by itself, right? If I understood the formual correctly, I can implement them?? 
solution: 

issue: I came across a weird bug : i\'m using a computation graph with 1 input and 9 outputs. When training it, it\'s all good \'till iteration 2000 or so, it starts showing me : "score at iteration xxxx is NaN" Is this an issue with my code ?

solution: 

issue: @homer12dwondering if it's normal to have a 2000 loss at the beginning of the trainingonly thing to add to the above: if you're doing regression, make sure you've normalized your labels too - not doing common cause of unusually large scores

issue: ahoy!  just wanted to say hello.,  I'm starting to integrated dl4j into myrobotlab...  making good progress and would like to say thank you for everything you all are doing here. Hi Adam, thanks, i'm basing my integration off of the AnimalClassification example from the dl4j examples.. it seemed like a pretty good starting place. We've been using javacv from@saudetfor a while now.  (it took a little while to work through dependency conflicts between the two projects, but I think we're on track now.)

issue: It looks like workspaces are coming with version 0.9, the thing I dont get is I have plenty of memory why GC causes issues in this case, and as far as I know Nd4j uses off heap memory and I see that gpu memory is growing whihc is  a good thing however gpu doesn't look utilized since I see mostly 0% and training is pretty slow when I have big dataset how do I cache everything in gpu memory and use that saudet: @agibsonccc

issue: papperwing: Thank you. Is it possible to create a DataSetIterator from a DataSet? I need to filter out some columns from my data set. so my current approach is RecordReader(CSV) --> DataSetIterator->DataSet->filter columns. But I can't do Early Stop with DataSet. So can I create DataSetIterator from a DataSet instead of RecordReader.

issue: Hi everyone, I\'m was training my net when I came across something (maybe) weird. I\'m using the UI to visualize the learning and when I look at the "update : Parameter ratios" chart, all the weights but one seem to stabilize at around -3.4. The other one is stabilizing around -4. Should I retune a bit my net ? 
solution: @homer12dwhen I look at the "update : Parameter ratios" chart, all the weights but one seem to stabilize at around -3.4. The other one is stabilizing around -4. Should I retune a bit my net ?I wouldn\'t be too concerned about that (if it was like -5 or something, then yes). you could try bumping the learning rate a bit on that layer.

issue: Hi everyone, is there any "easy way" to train the dl4j implementation of word2vec with corpuses having different minWordFrequency? The reason is simple, in one corpus I need all words to be part of the Vocab but for the other corpuses are there to provide more context and add words with higher frequency rate (at least 5). 
solution: JafferWilson: just use cpu for now. model-parallelism for w2v is planned, but not implemented yet. 

issue: loretoparisi: HelloI have found that when doing Word2Vec DLJ4 saves two kind of temp files in my mac (/var/folders/_b/szqwdfn979n4fdg7f2j875_r0000gn/T) temp folderword2veclike word2vec519696329339854921hand paraveclike paravec3408488442247979245lthese files, doing several train/etc. become very large (several Gigs)ecc.is there any way to change the folder where to save these files? thanks. last question.

issue:  [<-LINK->] anyone know what could be causing this error? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: Hey, sorry I hadn't been on this  until now. My conversion flow to reproduce the underflow (and overflow) was to retrieve a wave file, convert the bytes of that file to doubles, then convert the whole array of doubles to an INDArray. When looking at the data from the indarray, there were a lot of underflows/overflows. That might be a bug on its own. I still feel like rewriting the normalization part to allow retrieval of the max byte to rescale the bytes might be the best solution. Pretty sure there are still going to be issues when converting the doubles back to bytes from the Indarray though. There is also another technique for normalizing audio that I have had better success with. I can't remember the name of it though. The equation is  (audio - min_audio) / (max_audio - min_audio). I can add it as another technique when I find it. 
solution: 

issue: Sorry for this dumb question. I got this error when trying to train my computation graph. batchSize is 9. So which part of my model should I check? I have no clues to fix this. [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: So problem in the graph's config? 
solution: It's not thesis. It's just a project for my course. I'm building a self-driving car based on 2D game graphics. 180 is the raycasts around the car. I'm not evolve image processing(2D conv) because of my hardware. So using raycasting with 1D conv is cheaper to do. 

issue: raver119: hi, im having trouble getting the Workspace feature to work, i changed the dl4j artifact version to 0.8.1-SNAPSHOT, i now receive a nullpointerexception during the networkconfiguration builder phase. Do i also need to update nd4j to 0.8.1-SNAPSHOT (i tried, its not available on maven central, so i tried to build it but i need to build libnd4j to build the platforms, so i thought i would ask if im going in the right direction to solve this) [<-CODE->] 
solution: so build libnd4j, or can i access the sonatype repo.

issue: Is there a way to change the scale of the axis in the UI ? The cost of my net usually starts at 2000 but quickly decreases and i can't really see details because the y axis too big idk if what I said makes sense 
solution: 

issue: hello folks thanks for your help.. yesterday I could run 0.8.1-SNAPSHOT with workspaces support and gpus utilize much better. I had small problem with .so's however problem was about LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not pointing those .so's. I could understand it by printing out java.library.path to console, I can't wait for 0.9 version with built in support to workspaces@agibsonccc@raver119

solution: you need to define the properties though. then yeah use nd4j.backend like he's saying. 

issue: COA1IMB: i'm not a maven expert but i think you should clean up your pom. isnt it redundant [<-LINK->] 
solution: this is twiche [<-LINK->]. 

issue: okay and the variable name is nd4j.backend  since I gave it that name in this properties line <nd4j.backend>nd4j-cuda-8.0-platform</nd4j.backend> ?

issue: I have IntelliJ installed actually. But I got used to Eclipse too much and almost ended up ripping out my hair while using IntelliJ. Will try it tough. Is there any base pom.xml to initialize a Deeplearning4J project? 
solution: there’s also dl4j-nlp & dl4j-nn you might want to add eventually. Well.. that's true. I remember in a bigger project I had Eclipse spontaneously breaking, unable to find the main files.. Because yes. I was getting it fixed by opening the metadata file adding a new line and saving the file. And it was working again till it broke. I'll try to make Deeplearning4J work on IntelliJ. Let's see if it works there..

I am able to access the code layer, but there seems to be no api available to access the output of a specific layer. thanks a lot@raver119 I could not find activations() but feedForwardToLayer() probably would do the same

issue: I'm having an issue getting basic multilayer networks to work.  I've read all the docs, I'm using a simple test case that works  in 3 other networks, and with this library I'm just getting such odd results.  It's like this library has some things that are hypersensitive or something.  I'm classifying 0 as 0 and 1 as 1.   It's learning that both are basically the same, the longer I train the higher the value (0-1).  Any ideas on what could be going on? sorry meant 3 other frameworks 
solution: if it was just tuning it wouldn't work in 3 other frameworks, and it's such a simple problem, and as I said I read that already. 

issue: I am building an autoencoder whose reconstruction layer is of type OutputLayer I dont want to use model.fit() to train the AE 
solution: instead I have added noise to the encoder output and have used activate() to reconstruct the output. 

issue: convention wise most other frameworks I've used have a basic setup that works for a larger variety of problems.  But I do like the framework so far mainly because I'm actually solving real problems and I'm tired of research oriented frameworks ya I'm stuck in .net because game industry basically 
solution: 

issue: can we alleviate the builder pattern though? @gamemachineyou really can't avoid setting up an MDP of some kind RL by its very nature is about simulation 
solution: if you used  a set/get type builder, it would look like that: [<-LINK->]. as there already are some setters of that kind, I can actually already do half of that, but the other way looks more consitent. 

issue: So im having an issue. Im reading data from a custom file format. Changing it to a csv file. But the csv file now is so big i cant check if that process happend correcly or if this much data will be a problem for a CNN 
solution: 

issue: raver119: and how do i find that number, im guessing RAM right? Cause no mater what i put in the Xmx it keeps saying Cant allocate memory 1645600000 
solution: 

issue: raver119: Alright, so i got the memory issues away. But now just a questions cause im quite confused. Im running the CNN, but it just keeps Iterating. I have set the batchSize to 2, and iterations to 100. And atm its at Score at iteration 1391. This seems a lot to me and i think it will overfit.

issue: Hello, I try to do pretrain in a CNN. does DL4J support it ? can you shall me an example, please. I can't find it except for DeepAutoEncoderExample.java..... -_-... I try to set .pretrain(true), but i got a message, Pretraining not implmented..... 
solution: bleuosun: pretraining is viable for encoders/rbm etc stuff. 

issue: I would like to ask if someone can compare DL4J and Nervana Neon framework? They are saying they have the fastest 'tool' around. Does JVM stack helped to develop more reliable solution? chrisvnicholson: do you have plans to use Nervana Engine or other AI ASIC? chrisvnicholson: I forgot to tell you thank you for your fast replies! 
solution: 

issue: Looking at transfer learning ( [<-LINK->] ): None of the procedures in  step 2 and 3 change and save the model. Is there something missing? Shouldn't the transfer learned model be saved after each step and the saved model be loaded before starting the next? 
solution: the intuition here being you have a "base model" with some "modifications (fine tune config)" to "adapt a new model (new graph)" to train.

issue: Im having an issue with the training of a cnn. I have tried lots of things to get it to learn but im unsure if its the data thats an issue or if the code i wrote is wrong. Could someone look at the code i wrote to check if it makes sense? Its quite short. A combination of the CSV importer and the MNIST CNN examples.

solution: 

issue: Ok my question is as follows: It seems from here: [<-LINK->] that to fit a RNN the idea is to create a SequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator and then fit a network with that. In the Spark example the SparkDl4jMultiLayer is fitted with an RDD[DataSet].  So to marry the two and fit a RNN on Spark I'd like to fit a SparkDl4jMultiLayer with a RDD[SequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator], but the fit function does not accept those, so obviously I've misunderstood something. So could you give me some hints? Thanks

issue: And changing, a bit, the topic... Any suggestion on how to build a 'kind of segmentation' problem? I have very long 1 dimension arrays, and I need to identify regions of interest inside the arrays. I have each array labeled with a binary array of the same length, where 1 means region of interst, 0 means no interest. I have tried to build a network that learn the second vector (first a following a shape similar to a stacked autoencoder, and also using several layers of the array length),  but I get increasing scores during trainning... I am not sure that I clearly explained my problem... but any help would be welcome

solution: 

issue: Accuracy is low or network isn't learning? Start by reading [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->] 
solution: the codes doesn't change unless you want to tune  the gpu in some way (eg: you use the cuda environment) 99% of the time you shouldn't be touching that anyways though. 

issue: jakubbielawa: i think spark is totally separate from the GPU code, meaning someone like me can do it on my standalone server with the local dataset

issue: Um, not sure if this really is an issue or just a small bug, but i was running the GravesLSTMCharModellingExample, and while it was running it prints out the samples of text from shakespears work, but it seems to also include the Headers or Footers of the downloaded file. As some the examples have: [<-LINK->] Its not the biggest issue or bug in the world, but i though i would mension it. 
solution: just trying to give you some workarounds we can't really help the limitations of current cluster management. 

issue: a lot information for me  ,  i will have a look at the the related code, and we'll do the monitoring as you suggest, thank u@agibsonccc

issue: hiif i use remoteUI is there a way to detect if the remoteUIServer is running from clientside? perhaps via the RemoteUIStatsStorageRouter? ok this was my plan if there is no why to do this with dl4j 
solution: well it\'s pretty easy to do on your own, a "heart beat" class would probably be good at some point though. 

issue: marcel-93: you could try sending an http request to the intended ui url to see what the response code is eg: get request to remote url No just use snapshots for now kmmp: hmm how are you running it? I'm assuming you're completely new to java? as in: you haven't actually really customized it before? 
solution: 

issue: The remote router does a exponential backoff retry, so not 100% necessary that it be able to reach the ui server. But if you'd like to start one if it's not running yeah, try get / and if it doesn't succeed, start one.

solution: 

issue: Wow, it seems like there's not much support for genetic algorithms :/ To even visualize the layers without training seems very difficult. I'm having to force an update and that just spits out a ton of errors. There's no way to visualize weights, and no standard implementation :( UIServer won't render the model before training and there's no docs on implementing genetic training

issue: huitseeker: I've deleted all and re-checked out using the new pom.xml, if I now want to Right-click on project, Configure > Add Scala Nature this is not there anymore...any idea? 
solution: only issue I have is that I have to add the source foder scr/main/scala manually in eclipse.... 

issue: if the scala-maven-plugin is correctly configuredin the submoduleof your scala-project, aside the rest of the config, the eclipse import should pick up on the addition of both /src/main/java and src/main/scala as source folders what you can also do is add [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] in fact I recommend you add the source folders in your pom then scala will pick up on it

issue: Guys did anything change in the code wrt to dropout? I'm finding that during the build of a computation graph configuration I get a validation error that only occurs when useDropConnect(true). [<-CODE->] Specifically when it goes to build the configuration it gets a null layer. A minimal code that reproduces the error is [<-LINK->]

issue: Hello everyone,  I'm having an issue when training paragraph vectors where the training halts in between an epoch and doesn't seem to proceed at all. I've tried adjusting the training parameters but that didn't help. It seems to happen intermittently and with at different epochs each time. Any help is appreciated. 
solution: raver119: It looks like, despite the errors I have in pow and so on, I am able to start a project. Thanks for your time.. 

issue: About [<-ISSUE->] , is anyone able to run the gist given there to see if they get the same error related to dropout?

issue: Hi@agibsoncccet al, what about this one? [<-ISSUE->] don't like? 
solution: 

issue: saudet: I wanted to create issue for that, but@crockpotveggiesopened issue with exactly same error. As you are assigned to that issue should I added some example of images which have problem there? Or anything what could possibly help you? I would like to ask if there is some good manual or example how to work with INDArray. Main reason is that right now I take double[] from output INDArray and iterate over that but much nicer solution (and probably also faster) could be if I could work with INDArray directly. 
solution: 

issue: I would like to ask, how to get DataPreProcessor or DataNormalizer specific for Zoo model? Mainly I am asking for VGG16 where there was used TrainedModel.VGG16.getPreProcessor() but TrainedModel is now Deprecated so I would like to remove it. And second question In zoo there is alex net, but pretrainedUrl() is returning null, does it mean that there are not yet available trained model? 
solution: 

issue: Any reason why it wouldn't? Is there some sort of underlying question you have? If you're having issues with classes it's not going to be the java version it'll be the scala version

issue: raver119: I don\'t know if you are curious about "non-issues" on GPUs or if you perhaps know this trivia already. But I recently got a second GTX1080 in my computer, and now I can run two trainings simultaneously without any trouble (in seperate VMs though) by setting CudaEnvironment.getInstance().getConfiguration().allowMultiGPU(false).useDevice(DEVICE_ID); with DEVICE_ID 0 or 1 depending on the card I want to use.

issue: i plan to write an JavaRDD<INDArray> normalizer but i dont get std to work (compared to your NormalizerStandardize implementation). Maybe i misuse your api somewhere, does someone see the problem?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Can you help me figure it out? [<-LINK->] As it illustrate something wrong with my iterator therefore I rewrote fetcher there [<-LINK->] and it is based on my  data manager here [<-LINK->] please not laugh at me and point out what's wrong with it, thx yeah, [<-LINK->] thx 
solution: 

issue: So the original is like this:for (int i=0; i<embedding_dim; i++) {\n            double x = h_vec[i] + r_vec[i] - t_vec[i];\n            if (l1_norm == 1)\n                sum += fabs(x);\n            else \n                sum += x * x;\n        }They just use simple vector<double> and iterate over them and sum the values.I thought it would be more efficient to use INDArrays and use the fluent interface. 
solution: 

issue: btw, is there a way to install cuda quickly ? I actually skipped this while setting the examples 
solution: and you install it. 

issue: Hey everyone, is there a known workaround to get a keras masking layer to work in dl4j? 
solution: 

issue: I made issue about the keras-model-import and someone gave me this [<-LINK->] ,but when I ran this demo,I also met this [<-LINK->] In problem log, it said [<-LINK->] .Anybody know it? It looks like this demo cann't run in windows? 
solution: when I ran dl4j-import-example demo yesterday,hdf5 also had problem.So I made that issue. 

issue: So i tried getting the examples to work after getting openblas working on my mac. But now im getting this: [<-LINK->] It doesnt exit out of the program but also dosnt do anything else AlexDBlack: Hmm its the raw LenetMnistExample but you correct that its a project that i had to make myself. So im having a nother issue. Its now givving this error but it looks like a warning as it just keeps going and also works. Not sure if i should fix it or not  [<-LINK->] AlexDBlack: alright perfect. I got the other logging working but alright. Thanks wasnt sure

issue: earthat: ive had a lot of luck creating RDD[DataSet] using MLLibUtil.fromLabeledPoint earthat: its in org.deeplearning4j.spark.util.MLLibUtil 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: tried the github-example and that was showing nice results! eventually it would be good for beginners to recheck the plain android-tutorial... or it would be good to know if some1 else is experiencing the same missclassification then I can at least search for any error on my end btw. that spark-toolchain in combination with the csv-recordreader can be used on android also right!? havent dont anything with localhost-settings in android yet gonna try that now and see what happens ;) 
solution: 

issue: without maven i cant use ah ? 
solution: RamanRajarathinam: you are not permitted to ask questions without using a dependency manager. period. you can use maven to build an uber jar if you want we can show you how to do that. 

issue: outch... I was one of that guys that "randomly" downloaded jars... and after 30 tests I managed to unriddle all the necessary dependencys for android :D ofc I started by following a tutorial i do haha raver no I dont... but I was desperate I so much wanted access to the deeplearning4j world that I needed to invest the cost 
solution: i know thats out of the question. 

issue: i manually added all jars... but i know there should have been a more comfortable way but sometimes i rather invest time in order to fully understand what im doing 
solution: 

issue: So im having an issue like this. No matter how much i change the hyper parameters its still does the same thing. Any clue why, is the data size wrong. [<-LINK->] eraly: Yea, well it just outputs everything as 0, so there are 16 - 0 classes, 10 - 1 classes, 4  - 2 classes. 
solution: 

issue: In the training set? Not the test set.@gjossep workless: It means that you can asynchronously prefetch to improve performance if reading your dataset is a bottleneck  [<-LINK->] 
solution: That's a small dataset to train with. It will be very hard to learn something meaningful with it. At the very least use a network with very few params. 

issue: right now for creating the INDArray i'm first creating a float array and then calling Nd4j.create(array), is this the fastest way? iterating the dataset with float[] takes ~0.25s, with INDArray takes ~13.1s is this only the effect of cpu ram => gpu ram? 
solution: So that's the comparison you want to think of. 

issue: eraly: should i use columns for "features,labels" and repeat for each sample (=rows) ? eraly: wow, from 13.1s to 4.5s to read all dataset, and for some reason (i guess memory fragmentation), examples/s went from ~160/s to 1800 o.0 ! thanks! XD when i try to feedforward i get a weird error: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerExceptionat java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap.get(ConcurrentHashMap.java:936)at org.nd4j.jita.allocator.impl.AtomicAllocator.getAllocationPoint(AtomicAllocator.java:404).... maybe i found the error, i'm creating a FloatBuffer() directly, something tell me i shouldn't 
solution: 

issue: hi great work on Nd4j! are IComplexNDArray currently not supported? trying to instantiate i run into [<-LINK->] am i missing a maven dependency or something? 
solution: There is not a lot of ROI for us to support complex arrays but we hope to get to it eventually. 

issue: raver119: I slow down the propagating by decreasing l2 to .l2( 0.000000001 )  and got I expected :)      I'm very curious  what difference between Spark and my local single version 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys, maybe a stupid question, what is the Nd4j.gemm doing in the backpropGradient method of BaseLayer? And why the biasGrad is zeroed first?INDArray weightGrad = gradientViews.get(DefaultParamInitializer.WEIGHT_KEY); //f orderNd4j.gemm(input, delta, weightGrad, true, false, 1.0, 0.0);INDArray biasGrad = gradientViews.get(DefaultParamInitializer.BIAS_KEY);delta.sum(biasGrad, 0); //biasGrad is initialized/zeroed first 
solution: gemm there is equivalent to weightGrad.assign(input.transpose().mmul(delta)). 

issue: How can I save a model I trained, in order to simply load it without having to train it again at the beggining of the starting main(String[] Args) ? 
solution: 

issue: I'm actually evaluating several models in different threads  - will it synchronize all evaluations on single thread? 
solution: no.  [<-LINK->]. check this link. 

issue: How can I convert the Spark Dataframe to org.nd4j.linalg.dataset.api.DataSet so that I can input it into my dl4j model. My dataframe consists of 5 columns - _c0,_c1,_c2,_c3,_c4 where _c4 is the target variable and rest are my features. yesbut now I am trying to use dl4j model instead of spark ml's logistic regression The issue with the dependency was resolved but I could not find any way to input spark dataframe to the model okay when I split my dataframe using randomSplit, it creates a DataSet[org.apache.spark.sql.Row] but the model want to take org.nd4j.linalg.dataset.api.DataSetI know it is not a one click conversion but I can't find any solution of my issue anywhere.

issue: wangfeng-skymind: it's the value of the loss function (mean squared error, negative log likelihood etc, depending on what is set in the output layer config) on the current minibatch, plus any regularization terms (l1 or l2 value) 
solution: 

issue: Hi,I\'m working with ND4j examples and I found two issues:1- It is said in the comments that "elements arranged column major", but the outputs of the code show elements arranged as C.2- The linearView method do nothing. So the output of System.out.println(nd.linearView()); is the same as         System.out.println(nd); (in my code a 2x3 matrix).Any help please? raver119: 1) [<-LINK->] 2) [<-LINK->] raver119: @AlexDBlackThanks. 
solution: 

issue: sjsy: 1) where? nd4j supports both orders2) where? can i see that example? 1) columnar matrix doesn't mean it has to be F order so that example is fine 2) linearVIew is obviously wrong, as i see in source code it just returnsthis file an !issue please

issue: Hi there. How is it possible to replicate this Python (NumPy) code in Nd4j?In [1]: import numpy as npIn [2]: x = np.random.randn(5, 20, 200)In [3]: y = np.random.randn(200, 4)In [4]: res = np.matmul(x, y)In [5]: res.shapeOut[5]: (5, 20, 4) Seems that Nd4j is not able to apply broadcast as in NumPy... 
solution: 

issue: aleSuglia: broadcasting needs a bit of work..we don't do it automatically A tensor matrix multiply might work though? numpy has tensordot we have that because it serves some use cases - might be worth looking in to You can file an !issue and we can at least note broadcasting for the future 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: Specifically, I want to reproduce the same behavior of batch_matmul in TensorFlow. NumPy is able to do it with np.matmul(). So what can I do in order to obtain the same behavior? :) silvioOlivastri: Unfortunately,mulproduces an error:  Mis matched lengths: [1200] != [20000] 
solution: daksh-agarwal: use MLLibUtil. 

issue: hi all , how to get size of my word2vec embedding model? raver119: thanks 
solution: 

issue: numberOfWords in vocab x vectorSize x 2 (during training only) x 4 (for float data type) just close issue once you see that problem solved 
solution: we'll use your cores wisely.  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: raver119:  [<-LINK->] it seem work! Tomorrow I'll give you a final feedback :) 
solution: 

issue: hi guys, sorry for my trivial questions,in Word2VecSentimentRNN example  in this linelayer(0, new GravesLSTM.Builder().nIn(vectorSize).nOut(256)why the number of output for the first layer of RNN is 256? and how can i calculate for my network? 
solution: 

issue: hi,i meet ' Please ensure that you have an nd4j backend on your classpath.' what should i do? I had add the <dependency><groupId>org.nd4j</groupId><artifactId>nd4j-cuda-8.0-platform</artifactId><version>0.8.0</version></dependency>       in my pom file. 
solution: yan24639916: You need to add a dependency tond4j-native-platform.. 

issue: HelloI've RDD[DataSet]. I have to input it to my dl4j modelbut it is asking for DataSet only.  Is there any way I can achieve this ? 
solution: 

issue: yan24639916: you have a backend already - that looks correct and is usually all you needI'm not sure why that wouldn't work... so yes, show the full output in a gist (or pastebin) 
solution: 

issue: well, github is not fast in China 
solution: 

issue: problem that can be solved via simple vpn, can't be considered a problem  :)

issue: hey there... just got a minor question... whats the purpose of the scoreiterationlistener? does help me figuring out how many iterations my network needs in order to get to score 0.0? ah ok thanks, so if my score is showing a linear behaviour with convergence its going in the right direction=? 
solution: 

issue: @agibsonccc Finally my model worked. Thanks for your support.I am using this code for predictions. Though I am getting accuracy but I am getting predictions as NaN. [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Why I am getting NaN when my evaluation is giving me +ve real no. \nWhy they are 100 ? - Do I've to use one-hot encoding ? 
solution: well it's something like that..I don't have much contact - usually you use net.output not net.predict. 

issue: okay okayso you mean that after tuning and other things.. the model will give 1 output per prediction set.. not 100Am I right ? 
solution: 

issue: Unfortunately you can't use DL4j/ND4j on 32-bit x86 JVM Please, consider running this on 64-bit JVM instead got this message when running AnimalsClassification

solution: 

issue: btw, to cite nd4j in a scientific work, what would you suggest? 
solution: 

issue: I've been trying to create a nn capable of recommending animes based on votes of users, but i'm starting to think  there no pattern to learn, or i need much more than 50k users :(i would like to use something similar to word2vec, but i have no adjacent words any suggestion? 
solution: it's fairly new and you'd need snapshots to use it so there's not a ton of docs out there but it's pretty straightforward conceptually. 

issue: :) ok, i'll away a week to San Francisco, i'll try as soon as i get back 
solution: 

issue: Hi all. Just getting started with dl4j! Attempting to use it for a uni project. Limited exposure to machine learning in python. Wish me luck! huzzah! I've managed to run MLPClassifierLinear Now we're getting somewhere (so many prerequisites to getting the examples running!) 
solution: I installed git, maven, intellij, etc. 

issue: Help!Help!Help!Help!   What should I do? [<-LINK->] It seems mem not enough. If I reduce batchSizePerWorker, will it be helpful? I set workerPrefetchNumBatches=0 for saving more mem 
solution: 

issue: This problem I think has been solved by   java -Xmx12g -jar DFNRegression-1.0.jar, I increased heap, no mem problem any more, but [<-LINK->] , can someone figure it out? 
solution: hbb21st: if you're running spark and having heap space issues did you check our spark docs? [<-LINK->]. 

issue: So, again, new to DL (and only basic ML experience) Oh I know, I'm just prefacing my likely noob question :) Is the advantage of batching (not using the entire dataset with each training iteration?) that it can get around memory constraints? 
solution: 

issue: hi,i had set the UI to visualize the training process,when i use the cpu backend ,i can see everything on UI,but when i changed the backend from cpu to gpu, i can't see any information about training process.what's the reason for this? i just have one gpu. or should i change my code somewhere if i changed the backend from cpu to gpu? 
solution: 

issue: xuzhongxing: clearly, it's run out of memory during trainingas to why? impossible to say, without knowing exactly what you are doing with trainingthat said: for reduced memory use during training, you might try snapshots + workspaces (that reduces memory requirements) [<-ISSUE->]  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: hi,i used gpu as the backend to train model,i found a phenomenon that the cost time a epoch need grows as the training time grows.what's the reason for this? 
solution: 

issue: yan24639916: are you using !workspaces? if not that's why 
solution: 

issue: don't use cuda platform when using snapshots so again let\'s get everything up to "expectations" you'll need to do it the classifier way when not using platform that means a classifier version and a non classiifer version for nd4j-cuda-8.0 
solution: 

issue: Could you explain a little internals please? 
solution: workspaces is a new memory management model that doesn't rely on that. 

issue: I have a maven problem when using dl4j 0.8.1 snapshot. I configured pom.xml as dl4j-example does. In my pom, I configured maven to addClasspath to manifest. But in my generated jar file, the jar files in classpath of manifest has timestamp in them, like deeplearning4j-core-0.8.1-20170618.230505-290.jar 
solution: 

issue: 13:07:07,246 WARN  ~ Out of [DEVICE] memory, host memory will be used instead: deviceId: [0], requested bytes: [53840] I saw this message repeatly in log file, is it dl4j still running on cpu? 
solution: does reducing prefetchBuffer of ParallelWrapper can solve this issue?. also, using !workspaces. 

issue: what happens when you reduce batch size? 
solution: 

issue: if im going to use a single cpu instance of amazon ec2 there is no need for using spark, right? 
solution: levil221: spark is needed when you have many instances. 

issue: raver119: can I implement the iterator pattern in my CustomDatasetIterator? ok i'll try, i'll keep you posted 
solution: 

issue: is it right that you cant set workspaces in an MultiLayerSpace?do i have to set it after i get the bestModel?  [<-CODE->] like this

issue: AlexDBlack: OK the dl4j-examples AnimalsClassification fails with this interesting error if beforehand I do: (1) Download [<-LINK->] (2) Overwrite every example image with that downloaded TIFF, which I accomplished in bash: $ find IdeaProjects/dl4j-examples/dl4j-examples/src/main/resources/animals -type f -print0 | while read -d $\'\\0\' file; do cp Downloads/CCITT_4.TIF "$file"; done Their CCITT_4.TIF is a "CCITT group 4" TIFF, 1 bit per pixel. In that way it is like the (attorney privileged) TIFFs that are my actual difficulty. So I think fixing this error for theirs will likely fix it for mine. Not sure if it's reasonable on Gitter to expect@AlexDBlackwill see my mention on Monday morning in response to his message from Friday night.

solution: 

issue: deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j@b24bc7bare you sure that it is correct NOW? perhabs im just tired but as far as i see it the old version is correct 
solution: it could also be:expected=>labelactual=>predictionas it is in assert. No its the other way you have image of circle and there will be:Examples labeled as "circle" clasified by model as "square": 5 times.I thing its more correct.

solution: 

issue: If I want to build a crf layer on top an lstm layer, I need to implement my own implementation class of GraphVertex. Is my understanding right? Decompose your recommender system into deeplearning building blocks such as: MLP, CNN, RNN,   dl4j-examples has many examples of using these building blocks. 
solution: If I want to build a crf layer on top an lstm layer, I need to implement my own implementation class of GraphVertex. Is my understanding right?@agibsonccc. 

issue: I able trying to make a CG with dropout but when I run a simple problem I get a validation error. I put a minimal code on gist that reproduces it for me. The validation error says there is a null layer and happens when it tries to build the model. The gist is [<-LINK->] The tracceback is [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: I was thinking about implementing [<-LINK->] in dl4j.  It's implemented with tensorflow's tf.contrib.crf.crf_log_likelihood.   So are you suggesting against such a lstm+crf architecture?

solution: 

issue: wmeddie: I finally succeded, compiling dl4-examples with SNAPSHOTS and maven and using mavel local as sbt repository! i found no other way to compile with sbt 
solution: 

issue: uccollab: I am not completely sure but as i understood in both of these models , you train model in order to get the weights and use the weights of the neural network therefore you can even delete the output layer after having all of those wights. for instance in word2vec the vectors are the weights of neural network and not the output of neural network.

solution: 

issue: I switched to Resnet50 in zoo and I started to get this exception [<-LINK->] Could you give me hint what is probably wrong? It seems that it has no connection to Resnet model, so that change has to be caused by some pr. Doesnt anyone has the same problem? I found this mr into master in datavec (deeplearning4j/DataVec@8e33f17) but for some reason my code dont have problem withimport org.datavec.common.RecordConverter;Does that mean that it is in master but it is not yet in snapshot? After switching package of RecordConverter, I started to get UnsuportedOperationException: [<-LINK->] It is caused when presave is performed here: [<-LINK->]

DO you have any idea why this is happening? 
solution: I want to use network for binary multi-label classification so I am treating it this way, is it wrong?. 

issue: Hi, when increasing K(5) parameter in RBM, the score for iteration become Nan / Infinity.  Learning rate - 0.002 / 0.001 , Optimization Algorithm : Stochastic Gradient. Visible Unit : Gaussian , Loss function : KL Divergence.  The UI for RBM layer is not working. Crashed. So i used ParamAndGradientIterationListener. Please guide how to proceed. Thanks <nd4j.version>0.8.0</nd4j.version><dl4j.version>0.8.0</dl4j.version> raver119: my  nd4j/dl4j version 0.8.0 
solution: it wasn’t able to process updates that contain nans properly. 

issue: raver119: I copy the log setting file in the example fold,  I can get the output like ' INFO  ~ Starting training of split 1 of 15. workerMiniBatchSize=128, averagingFreq=5, Configured for 45 workers', but still not score printing. 
solution: 

issue: I'd like to plot an NDArray with two seperate lines. For this purpose, I'd like to take every 1st+2nd value into one array, every 3rd and 4th into another. How would you do this? There are a lot of methods and I can't seem to find something that fits. I'd probably start by unpacking the NDArray (but even that is not so easily found for me), doing my stuff on the array and create 2 new NDArrays. Is that the way to go? :-/ 
solution: and create 2 new NDArrays. 

issue: raver119: , My version is  <version>0.8-SNAPSHOT</version>.   Can you confirm my parameters are correct for unlabeled data classification for RBM ?  K(5) , Learning rate - 0.002 / 0.001 , Optimization Algorithm : Stochastic Gradient. Visible / Hidden Unit : Gaussian , Loss function : KL Divergence. 
solution: i downloaded DL4j example projects. In that, added a class StudyRBM  in unsupervised project using RBM.Builder().. 

issue: Hi, in my training corpus I have token with only one character. How can I set tokenizer to skip all tokens with length <= x? yes, I do this now but I can't train placeholder token :S yes, I can use stop works 
solution: 

issue: If we want to use snap shot , we have to set updatepolicy as daily . This will update current snapshot from specified url . Is my understanding correct? then ? 
solution: 

issue: I wanted to build fork of DeepLearning4j because I wanted to run tests but it fails on RequireActiveProfile. How can I set it? and from maven? I cannot find in sonatype test-resources.jar Is it possible that its not there? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: I found that l2 regularization in lstm hinders the score from getting to 0. When I set .l2(0.001), the score stayed above 3. When I remove .l2() setting, the score went close to 0. I see I thought the score does not contain the penalty part. But using L2 regularization could make the scores go up recurrently if train many epochs 
solution: 

issue: L2 and L1 regularisation are additive terms. Score can only get to exactly 0 in any net with it  all weights are 0 and the net somehow still has perfect predictions :) L2 can make the score increase if it's too high, as one possible cause - high L2 can cause small weights and hence bad predictions Small as in "most get driven toward 0 due to regularisation" Too little L2 can sometimes cause weights to get too large -> unstable learning -> bad scores Yes, see ui/vizualization page or the UI examples javadoc... Mobile so can't give you a link right now

solution: 

issue: Is it possible to finetune model? It seems that there is needed so many code duplicate when using Zoo :( How do I finetune MultiLayerNetwork? It doesnt has .fineTuneConfiguration(); I need replace last layer and I dont know how to do it with MultiLayerNetwork. I have done it for ComputationGraph That is for computationGraph isnt it? At least [<-LINK->] there is mentioned only CG and in MLN there is not that methods like fineTuneConfiguration() 
solution: 

issue: Hello, i need run the  image classifier demo of VGG-16 in my PC THAT I HAVE TO DO? 
solution: 

issue: Ok, starting to understand, I can't just say datavec version is 0.8.1-SNAPSHOT and then expect dl4j version 0.8.0 to work. Because deeplearning4j-core depends on datavec (and I'm particularly interested in datavec-data-image which differs between 0.8.0 and 0.8.1-SNAPSHOT) So I'll go to github, get deeplearning4j project, and obtain or create a deeplearning4j-core that depends on datavec 0.8.1-SNAPSHOT. Whee, Maven. OK, that seems like a plan. 
solution: 

issue: Hi. Have anyone successfully ran "detectgender" example from classification examples? If not, could you try to run it?  I have some problems with this one. 
solution: 

issue: Hi, is there any algorithm like PSO to replace BP and training parameters?  or where can I do for writing PSO code to training parameters? Thanks. 
solution: 

issue: Is there some actual problem? Are you sure you just aren't on an old version or something? 
solution: no - I picked last version as per documentation... git clone dl4j-examples. 

issue: I thought if you did this guy a favour - I hope you recorded project somewhere - I mentioned [<-LINK->] Have you opened this ? link was missing ;) yes OK - but if somebody closed the issue in github there could be last word - link to example... sorry my fault - I see it now: [<-LINK->] great thank you will check this OK :) 
solution: 

issue: If I am using ExistingMiniBatchDataSetIterator, then all the stuff about using previous Iterators (RecordReaderDataSetIterator, asyncDataSetIterator, etc) is forgotten? Meant that even if it is badly implemented once I have it transformed into miniBatches no optimalization will help after passing it into existingMiniBatchDataSetIterator ? 
solution: 

issue: Hello folks! My first time here. Probably mostly lurk, since I have lots of reading to do. 
solution: 

issue: I  have a theoretical question. As I understand it, Adagrad works well for training NN, but it seems to be scaling the stepsize for each feature. Doesn't that mean you're not following the gradient anymore? Why does it still work so well? 
solution: 

issue: mostafaalishahi: could you be more specific? adanecito: your pipeline should match however you trained the images. The imagerecordreader uses the nativeimageloader internally deil87:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: hi, there, i see "Automatic differentiation" in the road map with High priority. When the feature ready? 
solution: 

issue: I am trying  out the stacked denoising autoencoder code from [<-LINK->] , the training UI does not show graph at all for Activations and the model shows only input layer and layer 2. Layer 2 does not have any data in graphs. The training itself runs without errors but something seems to be wrong with the model :) Using version 0.8.0 Yes I am on it :) Selected deep autoencoder to be simpler example 
solution: 

issue: Should the cuda backend be on snapshot version as well? Snapshot version for cuda is not available at least from same repo: Error:(57, 0) Could not find nd4j-cuda-8.0-linux-x86_64.jar (org.nd4j:nd4j-cuda-8.0:0.8.1-SNAPSHOT).Searched in the following locations: [<-LINK->] <a href="openFile:C:\\Users\\tlaukkan\\Development\\projects\\logi\\server\\build.gradle">Open File</a> Hmm its actually some dependency which is missing I guess I could exclude that 
solution: 

issue: tlaukkan: you might need to specify the exact version of the native or cuda package, including the timestamp for SNAPSHOT, yes in the case of Gradle or sbt that is, it doesn't work very well 
solution: 

issue: I didn't see it. Can you tell me again? My English is not very good 
solution: 

issue: Is there example of how to get compressed feature vector of one sample from already trained deep autoencoder network? Say I have run through the training data set and would like observe what kind of compressed feature vectors it is producing for samples agibsonccc: got the performance to be good by using big batches btw, thanks thank you again 
solution: 

issue: OK, I'm sorry. There may be language barriers, but I can't understand it 
solution: If you're lacking context I am going to do a worse job typing in this channel than a nice docs page with examples and animations. 

issue: agibsonccc: what do you mean under compute proper array? I loaded image into INDarray and want to calculate mean value per channel. The image itself has shape [1,3,256,256], I usechannelArray = imgArray.get(new PointIndex(0), new PointIndex(channel)) to get concrete channel values. Then I use mean(0,1) to calculate mean across both dimensions and get 91.79, then I load data to double[] using "channelArray.data().asDouble()" and use j8 DoubleStream to get mean and it gets me 101.58 
solution: agibsonccc: because if I do mean(1), then it will return 256 elements array of mean values per row. agibsonccc: at first it was 1x3x256x256, then I want to take a particular channel and I do it like thisimg.get(new PointIndex(0), new PointIndex(channel))It return NDArray of shape 256x256 and then I work with the array of that shape. 

issue: is it possible to limit the number of cores dl4j uses? i tried   export OMP_NUM_THREADS="4"  right before i run my tool, but there is no effect... 
solution: 

issue: Does it make a difference what the image size is versus results for training?. If I did not want to input a 3k x 2k image could I say input a 1.5k by 1k? does the image for training represent the size you might see in a bigger image just without all the space around it filled with pixels? Basically the training image is just the feature want to classify and not alot of pixels around it? 
solution: adanecito: yes, image size matters - to a degreetypically images are scaled to 200-300 pixels on each dimension - but it totally depends on the architecturelarge input -> larger activations and more parameters (for dense/output layers later in the net, not the CNN layers)of course, some images really require higher resolution (very fine detail on medical images, for example might be lost by scaling down to small size). 

issue: What's not working for you? 
solution: 

issue: I found some advice for caffe user to use lower batch size, which result in my case to nans but they advised to increase iterate sizecan you link that? "incrase iterate size" isn\'t really a thing... .iteraitons(int) is certainly closest, but I doubt that\'s the solution they are proposing 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: Hello Alex. How to do negative sampling in dl4j? I need to train a DNN with about 1 million classes. Is there any demo show how to do a negative sampling softmax ? AlexDBlack: Could you give me a link to show a similar demo how to implement my own loss function? 
solution: Glanderlice: you'll need to derive + implement all the mathbut for an example of the interface you'd implement: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Will parallelWrapper with early stopping work with statListener? 
solution: but there's special pw fork for early stopping. 

issue: it's unnormalized, usually 0 to 255 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: Thank you. So if I understand everything correctly, if I am to supply a 3 channel image to the NN, it has to be a WIDTHxHEIGHTxCHANNELS tensor, with floats/doubles between 0.0 and 1.0? 
solution: right, use that if you want 0 to 1 normalization ^^as to input images (minibatches): it's 4d, [minibatch, channels, heigh, width]. 

issue: I want to classify an image(shirt , tshirt), that does have pockets or not using deeplearning? Can any one guide me 
solution: vishal-softvan:  [<-LINK->] that could help you with using pretrained conv net.. also this could help [<-LINK->]. papperwing: i guess i am starving for this only. zillions of thanks to you buddy. Let me classify the images and start woking on it. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] the inputs has 10 elements(show in variables watcher) but inputs.length is 11. What did I missing here? 
solution: I implemented a MultiDataSetIterator. It has 10 inputs. 

issue: raver119: Is it needed for parallelism to add something like that? [<-CODE->] Because otherwise my ide doesnt see stuff from this 
solution: 

issue: raver119: Thx for the inforamtion about Doc2vec. I can't load the 2GB d2v model for lack resources (2CPU cores, 8GB RAM machine). The loading have crashed in different ways: gc error, oom error, Model could not be loaded. Trace: No space left on device. Do you think I should not happen? There is different processes running in the machine Thank you@raver119, I am preparing the trace

issue: manfredcalvo: not that I know of, but:look at Boolean Indexing https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples/blob/master/nd4j-examples/src/main/java/org/nd4j/examples/Nd4jEx6_BooleanIndexing.java\nif you control your indexing array, it's easy to make this a matrix product operation ([1,2,3,4,5] * [[1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]] == [1, 1, 2, 2]) 
solution: 

issue: manfredcalvo: no, at least not directly - you can of course pull the values out to an int[] and index that way kwatters: ImageRecordReader.getLabels() will give you a List<String> - indexes are based on the order there also, it's alphabetical kuroro20: yes, it's totally possible - just add them to your RNN, and use .setInputType(InputType.recurrent(x)) to add the required preprocessors (to handle the time-distributed part)as to when to do it: I can't recall a good reference for experimental results or anything, but in practice I've seen that sometimes it's worth trying just call fit(DataSetIterator) multiple times in a loop 
solution: 

issue: Hey, DataSetIterator.totalExamples() throws java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException.Any suggestions how can i get examples count in my iterator? DataSetIterator.numExamples() throws the same exception. 
solution: 

issue: hello, I would be grateful for any suggestions on how to link simple nd4j code with my local, from-source build of libnd4j AlexDBlack: running INDArray nd = Nd4j.create(new float[]{1, 2, 3, 4}, new int[]{2, 2}); on cuda backend, I get "Can\'t allocate [DEVICE] allocation buffer memory!" So i\'ve decided to build [<-LINK->] from sources AlexDBlack: However, I do not have a clue, how to link *.so libs to my maven code 
solution: building from source we have instructions for that already: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: raver119: well, I have 4 NVIDIA cards, two of them are idle so this is not the issue about low memory 
solution: 

issue: piotrmwojcik: so? 3 gpus have 150mb free, 1 gpu has 350mb free. all are busy with python. exactly as i’ve expected 
solution: and the rest - it’s better for us to preallocate them once, instead of doing small temporary allocations on each op call. 

issue: piotrmwojcik: so again your maven dependencies have nothing to do with your memory error here 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: Hey, I'm still here. Which methods of the SequenceRecordReader must be implementedfor my custom version?

solution: 

issue: Hi! I ran on an error message while training on GPU, where I can't figure out the problem. [<-LINK->] I'm using the AsyncDataSetIterator and I'm training on a GTX 1080 Ti. The above message came up after a number of trainings where I change values of kernel size and stride to figure out the impact on training time. Before the error, I noticed some freezes on my desktop up to the point it stopped the training and showed this message. Please let me know what other information you need for my case These are my CudaEnviroment settings I have: [<-LINK->]

issue: Can i do classification with RBM + output layer for classification . Since RBM can get features from my data set 
solution: yes but even then I wouldn't use RBM. I will use VAE for my classification. 

issue: Hi all! I left my cnn to train at night on different kernel size/stride values. In the logs I keep, it started slowing down gradually from kernelSize = 7, stride = 1, up to kernelSize = 19, stride = 18 where it gave this error: [<-LINK->] My cnn configuration was: [<-LINK->] and my CudaEnviroment settings were: [<-LINK->] The training was done with 0.8.0 versions of nd4j/dl4j/datavec

solution: 

issue: I would like to ask for advice about loading images into record reader, could someone help me with that? I am using RecordReaderDataSetIterator and in record reader I am loading data from kind of list of samples (image address and label's) Now implementation of RecordReaderDataSetIterator changed and it requires to implement methods like record(Uri,DataFileStream) but I dont know how to load images or labels, because I dont know what to put into RecordMetaData It requires uri and RecordMetaData but I dont have way to store there labels anywhere. As you can see I am bit lost :D 
solution: 

issue: hello everybody i build a word2vec model with dl4j, now i have to classify many documents with two labels...my problem is that i have a lot of noise because these documents are personal and there are a lof ot personal information that maybe they interfere with the classification (i think) 
solution: papperwing: it totally depends on the RecordReader... in fact, you shouldn't be creating record meta data instancesexceptin conjunction with a custom record reader. papperwing: then yeah, it's up to the individual record reader as to the type it returns. And if it doesn't need a URI, that could be nullalso note that if you aren't going to use the metadata functionality, you can just throw an unsupportedOperationException for those methods. 

issue: Is RecordMetaData.getURI() somewhere in important place used? Because I dont have URI so I would like to let it empty AlexDBlack: Yeah I have custom record reader and I am not able to fit my data into existing RecordMetaData :D mainly because all records are in memory not on the disk 
solution: 

issue: raver119: i am reading CNN are usually used for image/video processing and RNN for texts.... is that not correct? 
solution: raver119: another thing... let suppose you have many sectors and you want to classify documents inside those sectors... BUT.... a document can be classified in one or MORE sectors too. 

issue: Is there any new about [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: After update of my RecordReader when I get this exception [<-LINK->] it stops and it is not doing anything. It seems that there are still waiting threads. last week when this error occurres the sample was skipped.

issue: Hi@raver119, I have a small question, is o.n.n.NativeOpsHolder - Number of threads used for NativeOps: 32 showing the number of threads per warp? And if so, is it the same on all cuda cards or could I increase it for my card?edit: added tag :D 
solution: ugh.. 

issue: raver119: can you check my question please? Probably it got buried. I just want to make sure that I use my GPU properly while training. 
solution: this is the best way to share it with you. 

issue: oh I meant the one here, in gitter:"Hi@raver119, I have a small question, is o.n.n.NativeOpsHolder - Number of threads used for NativeOps: 32 showing the number of threads per warp? And if so, is it the same on all cuda cards or could I increase it for my card?" raver119: for now though, everything compiled correctly with 0.8.1-SNAPSHOT, when/if I get an error, I will post it in the issue 
solution: 

issue: guys can we not use GPU to train word2vec? because i also added <artifactId>nd4j-cuda-8.0-platform</artifactId> as doc says 
solution: 

issue: raver119: does that imply switching out the OS version for 0.8.0? if i do that then code throws an exception saying there is no ND4J Backend 
solution: use nd4j-native-platform artifact instead. 

issue: raver119: hmm great, when I use the method eval in Evaluation, I use the same data which uses to train my model, do you think it is great way to evaluate my model properly ? 
solution: better is to split it at beggining for example 80:20 and use one for training and the second for validation. also try to preserve distribution of data between both sets if its possible.

issue: I want to use word2vec on patient claims data, but I want to separate each patient as a separate topic, not combining their data in any way.  Would I accopmplish this by putting each patient on a separate line?  Does your basiclineiterator ensure that the words on one line do not show up in the context of another line?  alternatively, could I use doc iterator to separate patients? 
solution: 

issue: raver119? present? Your commit to the SequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator caused it to break when using NormalizerStandardize.fit(SequenceDataSetIterator)

solution: 

issue: I can't find my earlier question raised here. But my real question is, the OpenNLP in maven repository is 1.8, but DeepLearning4j is still using 1.5, which was 3 years late. Is it deeplearning4j, UIMA that will take care of the openNLP upgrade? agibsonccc: @raver120I filed a story here: [<-ISSUE->] . Thank you.

issue: Question on GPU performance: I found a paper ( [<-LINK->] ) comparing dl4j with other frameworks. Yet performance is compared using CPUs. So I think this is not a fair comparison. Do you have any resources or can point me somewhere where GPU performance is discussed (I tried searching the internet and these channels, but haven’t found anything)? Thanks a lot for your help! 
solution: crockpotveggies: also did great job improving benchmarking for us. 

issue: Is there dependency for ParallelWrapper for 0.8.0 
solution: But I'd suggest snapshot with new mechanics. Gradients sharing, that is. Yes. You can find that dep in our !examples. 

issue: Correct,colValsis modified in-place. Just to confirm, do you mean all in-place changes inINDArray colValswill reflect back in theINDArray featuresas well? If I understood you correctly, no assignment will be needed. Please confirm.@raver119 
solution: So once you modify column - you modify original array. 

issue: CnnSentenceDataSetIterator keeps on throwing ND4J exception, is that a known issue? All words in the vectorized sentence are known and present in the dictionary. [<-CODE->] The exception was no longer thrown after I switched to latest version.

Following theBasicHyperparameterOptimizationExample, let's say one of my parameters depends on values generated byParameterSpace<Integer> layerSizeHyperparam = new IntegerParameterSpace(16,256). Is there a way to transform the output oflayerSizeHyperparamor - for example - add it to output of another parameter space?.

solution: you're free to do anything you want. 

issue: when should i use backprop in autoencoders? 
solution: 

issue: crockpotveggies: thanks for clarifying. I am only interested in GPU, cause that’s the only reasonable thing to use. Good to hear that dl4j is in range. It does not bother me if it is not the fastest as long it can compete and is in the range of its competitors. 
solution: 

issue: I tested it out, it's not that far off! with a little work it should do exactly what I wanted.  but with the atan function there's a couple issues, x could be zero (as well as the issue with the quadrants) 
solution: yes you are right, there is an implementation in C but it would need that CUDA C stuff.  it looks like they've made it easier since i last looked at it.

solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: So I don't know if having all my examples on a single entry of a RecordReaderMultiDataSetIterator is a right situation. Maybe I do have to split them in DataSet? Or I do really have to use ComputationaGraph even if it's not necessary as I have just a simple stack of layers? Thanks for the patience but actually in the files there are big integer numbers separated by spaces, but I already had take care of translations and so on. I mean, everything works, if I print the single entry of the RecordReaderMultiDataSetIterator I see the right data inside. I just can not fit the net. I used MultiDataSet because of the function addInputOneHot and addOutputOneHot that I needed. But  Maybe I have to translate the multidataset in a dataset? Just guessing, I'm not sure about that and that's why I'm asking here. Thanks, really

issue: I noticed if I have several features the behavior of the model changes on the all the tests after the first one. So for the first run the probabilities for the three add to 1 or 100%. Then on the second run two of the features probabilities add to 1 and the remaining feature goes to 0.00. I am keeping the model instance around and using it for subsequent tests. Should I reset something or reload the model file again? Also, if I have say three features in a input image image would the model output be [0.33,0.33,0.33] or [1.0,1.0,1.0] assuming I have one 300x300 input image and all three features are there and I have a 100% accurate model. Ok I am rerunning my training to try to get above 90% accuracy since before I had around 86%. I tried reloading the model each time before use but still issue persists. I am thinking now it is something about the training even the the eval looked good Ok getting to 93% helped a bit so I am trying for 97%. So I should be fine

Also, it does support classifiers, it's coursier that doesn't. Also, I haven't seen any problems with snapshots — issue or it didn't happen (snashots being used for development as thoroughly in the scala world as they are in java, it would be surprising if there was a massive flakyness about sbt in that respect that  had failed ot get to the ears of developers) raver119: @agibsoncccfeel free to tag / mention me on those sbt issues ztaoo: the answer in your gist ( [<-LINK->] ) is simply that we do not release for scala 2.12 yet, so this line :val dl4jSpark = "org.deeplearning4j" %% "dl4j-spark" % dl4jVercannot possibly resolve. It gets expanded into"org.deeplearning4j" % "dl4j-spark_2.12" % dl4jVer(given your setting forscalaVersion)and that artifact has just not been built the reason we don't build for 2.12 is that our dependencies, notably Spark, have not released for 2.12 so, we can't provide a 2.12 artifact. you can either compile spark for scala 2.12 yourself, and then recompile dl4jor you can switch your project to use scala 2.11

issue: AlexDBlack: ,   i wonder is there a existed loss function in deeplearning4j that is same as  cross-entropy  like: C=1n∑x[ylna+(1y)ln(1a)] i have checked all loss function implementions  in deeplearning4j ,  seems can not find such implementions 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: I just want to use the library for matrix computations! I just have to include the snapshot in my pom.xml? 
solution: 

issue: I'm installing dl4j on MAC OSX ... when i try mvn clean install I have the follofing error symbol:   method setAlwaysOnTop(boolean)[ERROR]   location: variable layerStage of type javafx.stage.Stage Any hekp? 
solution: 

issue: I would like to ask, if its ok to normalize image to 0--1 or if it should be -1--1 
solution: or somewhere I saw that somebody is subtracting mean of channel (VGG16 i think). AlexDBlack: That zero-mean is in ND4J called VGG16ImagePreProcessor?. 

issue: Hi all. I'm getting this error when trying to evaluate a model with Spark, what am I doing wrong? I'm trying with the same input and test dataset I'm having issues pasting into the gist  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] and here's how the data looks as an rdd  [<-LINK->] !gist can't paste into gist :( my mistake with layer names, that was just experimentation. I tried the tutorials, this also yields the same error:  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] info on data/model:  [<-LINK->] raver119: I'm trying to do something similar to this example: [<-LINK->] Hey I figured it out :) My output nOut was the incorrect size, and did not match the number of labels 
solution: 

issue: I try to understand how it works internally, so I didn't use the whole package, only used one source file, integrated in my scala project. When I am wholly on the DL road, I like to contribute too. 
solution: try lower omp_num_threads or higher ulimit. but if you have too many Java threads - you will use more native threads. 

issue: Any reason I'd be getting this error in my own project (not examples): java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no nd4jcpu in java.library.path I tried both 'nd4j-native' and 'nd4j-native-platform' in my gradle build settings platform gives a different error version is 0.8.1-SNAPSHOT MacOS X with Macports 
solution: 

issue: knightcode: Try again with Maven if possible knightcode: adding the classifier dependency should also work: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: yeah I wouldn't know much about using it with gradle but maven is legit, if you need extra flags it's in the README.md near the end of nd4j repo I use -Djavacpp.platform.compiler=g++ on Mac and my g++ is version 5 if ur a brew user I think there were some instructions on how to set gcc/g++ to version 5 by default otherwise it's going to use clang and I can't remember the error it gave but I decided against using it my command line is usuallymvn clean install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -Djavacpp.platform.compiler=g++to compile in the nd4j folder, if it's starting from scratch. otherwise u could skip clean keyword skip the tests because two always fail :) 
solution: but of course that's if you switch to maven.  if you let me know what packages you use, I may have a suitable pom.xml. 

issue: is there a separate package for this classifier?  I sent PJ my pom.xml with dl4j and nd4j and it's basic but should i add something to it for him? 
solution: that was the difference between the examples project and my own. 

issue: AlexDBlack: ,   for the Evaluation,  currently implemention is only for  binary or multi-class,   do you guys plan to support for multi labeled cases, (then just average more then one class's stats like recall, accuary)? what i means is why can not use just one output layer to output predicted array then compared with real hot vector (more thn one 1),   actually i use this way to resolve multi-labeled  problem, like output: [0.9,0.6,0.1,0.99], real label:[1,0,0,1] 
solution: 

issue: I am using paragraphVectors for NLP.  How to train the model to identify the difference between a sentence with and without "Not". For example , i ate well  Vs i did not eat well. 
solution: 

issue: When training an RNN, do we need to call rnnClearPreviousState(); in the loop that does the epochs? [<-CODE->] 
solution: and, it's only necessary if you are using rnnTimeStep. 

issue: caozuo: could be an issue with your data pipeline, etcmind opening an !issue with details (and ideally, a copy of your net) so we can take a look? thanks. I can't guarantee someone will look at it right away - but we will take a look when we can 
solution: 

issue: nope, sorry. file an !issue. 
solution: 

issue: CedricReichenbach: could you put your state of mind in an !issue? Just put doc in the title We'll be happy to try to update this a bit or at least add some context thanks for that 
solution: 

issue: jesuino: check out !examples, there's multiple different examples that involve csv starting from simple CSV, ending sequences via csv nonono do not use that backend it’s 2+ years old so, buggy, slow, etc "org.nd4j" % "nd4j-jblas" % "0.0.3.5.5", this one 
solution: 

issue: I solved the backends exception by adding these dependencies:   "org.nd4j" % "nd4j-native-platform" % deeplearnVersion,"org.nd4j" % "nd4j-jblas" % "0.0.3.5.5", without this one: "org.nd4j" % "nd4j-native-platform" % deeplearnVersion; I still get backends exception. 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I can compile the dl4j example projects with "mvn clean install", but when I was trying to import to Eclipse, I got this error: Errors occurred during the build.Errors running builder \'Maven Project Builder\' on project \'deeplearning4j-examples-parent\'.Missing parameter for pluginExecutionFilter. groupId, artifactId, versionRange and goals must be specificed, but found: groupId = \'com.lewisd\'artifactId = \'lint-maven-plugin\'versionRange = \'[0.0.11,)\'goals = \'[]\' 
solution: 

issue: hi, wonderful project you have here.  i am trying to understand, at a high level at least, the data flow between cpu and gpu memory--when copies are made, etc.   any suggestions about where to look? as far as i can tell, when training, you copy input data to the gpu one batch at a time and then are able to do all the forward and backward prop in gpu memory with no copies back to cpu-land? and gradients live in gpu-land but i may be missing some copies . . . 
solution: 

issue: amuseoffire: i think they do a lot on GPU-side when using CUDA that would make sense to me 
solution: 

issue: firasdib: This example does exactly that: Use data parsed in memory. [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: i dont know@kuroro20but I think it's not problem to write one yourself, is it a standard format of repeating data and label or is it separate list of data and then list of files at the end? i mean list of labels 
solution: 

issue: You're from packt I assume? I always steer our users away from your books There's a reason you don't get first class support from us I have never seen good reviews I wrote the only one the community needs for oreilly Please take this elsewhere Go back to linkedin to pitch these things I don't want to see that here 
solution: 

issue: Hi everyone, I have a problem with mnistDataSetIterator: Exception in thread "main" java.io.EOFException: Unexpected end of ZLIB input streamAlso, I am a little bit confused, there are: org.nd4j.linalg.dataset.api.iterator.DataSetIterator and org.deeplearning4j.datasets.iterator.datasetiterator, do they do the same thing ? thanks for clarification. As for downloading mnist, it really gives me the same error everytime. i will try you suggestion@wmeddie wmeddie: thank you all, it did work well when i deleted the content of the MNIST folder and relunch the program 
solution: 

issue: hi! i\'m tring to import a keras model with importKerasModelAndWeights("model.json","model.h5") and i get the following exception: Exception in thread "main" org.deeplearning4j.nn.modelimport.keras.InvalidKerasConfigurationException: Could not determine Keras model class (no class_name field found). any idea? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: Hi, If I'm using DQN in rl4j,  How do I identify overfitting/underfitting? agibsonccc: just to paraphrase, for DQN in rl4j, I can identify overfitting by experimenting with parameters..... okay but my concern was that if it's classification problem we'll have straight forward results okay. 
solution: 

issue: deichbrise: did you see our spark page? [<-LINK->] we have some basic docs in there So looking at your gist..those are warnings my friend please come back if something actually..stops your job :D 
solution: 

issue: lukeczapla: I have a bunch of vectors that I want to use as input, containing doubles. I've copied most from that Mnist-example, just not sure how to feed it the vectors. lukeczapla: Haha, I know the feeling. No worries. Right now my values are a stored in a super long sparse array. But of course, that would be equal to a Nx1 matrix if that is required I probably can't store ALL of them in one matrix since I'd run out of memory 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: @raver119Can you useInputType.convolutionalalong with word embeddings? I'm using an iterator based onCnnSentenceDataSetIteratorand I'm struggling to set up convolution/subsampling layers, but no luck yet. 
solution: 

issue: MultiLayerNetwork class seems to have a version where you can give it all in an matrix.  How big is the data?  I mean it'd huge to be huge to run out of memory *it'd have to be huge 
solution: yeah I see what you mean, that'd be like several tens of gigabytes.  maybe just put batches into the INDArray?. 

issue: Hio anyone here who may could help me starting with a toy example migration from python to dj4?... I have some trouble to map things in pythonland to dl4j land ;) 
solution: 

issue: Do you know when DL4J 0.8.1 will be released? I would like to play with the zoo, but I really can't use snapshot right now tomthetrainer: thanks for your response. I think I will try the keras model. What I want is to use models to understand better the API possible inputs and outputs. Do you suggest any reading/example about importing Keras model besides de dl4j docs. Thanks! Thanks 
solution: 

issue: mishal-harbi: Try setting JAVA_HOME to C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_131  (Take out that last backslash). java -versionandmvn -vshould just work before you try anything else. 
solution: 

issue: mishal-harbi: what about deleting that cache directory? mishal-harbi: ignore the errors about the system file, that's normal. look at any errors at the bottom of the lists mishal-harbi: then there is no reason it shouldn't work. what happens with the following sample code? [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: eraly: Loss function, got it. Thanks! 
solution: 

issue: Hello!!! just starting with deep learning and dl4j. Are there some example on dl4j of semantic textual similarity? I would like to define a simple algo to apply in the SemEval-2016 Task 1, that is, given 2 sentences how similar they are (I have a training dataset like sim_score sent1 sent2). Thanks! :) 
solution: 

issue: miwale: which maven error you've got? and what exactly you've downloaded and trying to build? dl4j itself or just examples? 
solution: 

issue: @saudet problem fixed. I applied the following fix I found in the troubleshootingYou may have incompatible DLLs on your PATH. To tell DL4J to ignore those, you have to add the following as a VM parameter (Run -> Edit Configurations -> VM Options in IntelliJ):-Djava.library.path="" other examples like CUDA also works now. Thanks. 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys can anyone guide me on the error I am getting ,it says I am not providing loss function but I am providing a loss function .  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: I'm running into:IllegalStateException: Mis matched lengths: [10000] != [1000000]  [<-LINK->] I'm still messing around with the encdec example, so I'm sure it's just me not understanding something 
solution: i.e. if plate in your state holds 7 chars, and uses latin chars. within each block of 36 elements in output vector - there's probabilities. 

issue: Hi, I am having some issues with nd4j dependencues in my sbt project. [<-LINK->] Here is the sbt specification [<-LINK->] Thanks@raver120Could anyone help me with what I might be missing? I am able to run deeplearning4j examples but not in my sbt Prediction io project. raver119: thank you so much. I had been struggling with this error for a day !

issue: anshurajendra: Welcome! Here's a link to Deeplearning4j's Gitter Guidelines, our documentation and other DeepLearning resources online. Please explore these and enjoy! [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: I have been trying to load the Stanford pre-trained global vectors to supply to the "useExistingWordVectors" method of the ParagraphVector.Builder and I have been running into a lot of trouble. When I supply the vectors it trains fine, but doesn\'t store the labels even though I\'m using a LabelAwareIterator, so I\'m unable to get any useful information from the model (i.e. if I call the nearestLabels method I get a message saying there are no labels). When I don\'t supply existing word vectors, the labels are stored and the method works. How can I supply pretrained vectors and store labels? Thanks.

solution: 

issue: yea in sweden right?  i used to live in uppsala i'm in NYC now it's very hard to follow this chat a lot of times, but I PM'd you.  things just go flying by until little breaks like this :) 
solution: 

issue: Okay, so I have a working (if inefficient) implementation of the SELU activation function. The only other thing I need is to implement "alpha-dropout", as described in [<-LINK->] . That is, randomly "dropped" inputs are set to-lambda*alphainstead of 0. Is there a way to do this in my own code? Thanks,@AlexDBlack. Can a preprocessor be applied to each layer? or would that solution only work to "drop" network inputs? 
solution: 

issue: It created a very big jar, most of them are in spark platform. Can I filter them out? crockpotveggies: I am doing this: [<-CODE->] the new exception is java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/bytedeco/javacpp/openblas how can I include openblas? is openblas a class? now I am getting this error:java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no openblas in java.library.path seems there's a jar openblas-0.1.19-1.3-linux-x86_64.jar missing I put it in spark external lib folder, no luck is there any name requirement?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Hi, in the above graph there is a sharp reduction of loss; but I cannot understand it.Another problem: Although the loss is zero at the end, the accuracy on the training data is not 100%.Any hint please? 
solution: sjsy: add a ScoreIterationlistener - my guess in you have NaNs. 

issue: I keep seeing this message:momentum has been set but will not be applied unless the updater is set to NESTEROVS.- can someone explain that to me? I'm usingUpdater.ADADELTA 
solution: 

issue: This is where the prediction data is calculated (after the train data is played through the RNN the previous line: [<-LINK->] The offset 100 plots the prediction and actual data after the training data. 
solution: 

issue: hey can anyone guide me with any solution to this :-  [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: Nd4j.hstack(). 

issue: Hellos guys, are gradient updates computed based on the computeScore method of ILossFunction? I'm extending LossMSE to tweak certain things that I need, and if I modify computeScore it seems to work for the score listener but not so much for the updates Nevermind, already found scoreArray and computeGradient :) 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] This keeps happening to me and I can't seem to solve it. eraly: Yes, thats what I'm doing. How do you mean shuffle classes? I shuffle all of the data after each epoch. This is how it looks now...  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Hey, I want to do regular machine learning, in Java... ...DL4J seems nicely rounded, etc...and I thought it would support/document regular machine learning more, seeing as surely it has to use it under the covers, itself. But I can't really see any support for the various classification algorithms, etc Any ideas? 
solution: 

issue: neurofog: u can do a lot of web app stuff through spring and integrate it with your dl4j and nd4j usage 
solution: yeah i'd think it's better to do all the security stuff through a system like spring and then properly call things from dl4j after it's gone through there.  I have oauth working in spring if this guy wants an example, but spring's got all the social network versions of that too. 

issue: hi. i keep receiving "class XX has never appeared as a true label. This class was excluded from the average recall" for many classes XX, although they have actually appeared as a true label. Besides, I receive too low evaluation results (sometimes both precision and recall equal to zero). Am I doing something in a wrong way? 
solution: 

issue: Is there a way to backpropagate the loss value through the NN? Essentially, i want to backpropagate a float value through my NN 
solution: 

issue: lukeczapla: I can do that, but how do you model multiple features? Like uppercase/lowercase? I have a quad core, its not fast but ok for testing. I have a faster cluster at uni. 
solution: I had an idea where I wanted to use both normalized vocabulary and unnormalised and just concatenate the vectors, to keep them fixed length. So I create one case sensitive and one insensitive, create the FOFE codes for the current word in the current sentence, and slap them together.. 

issue: they have swedish snus here in NY now haha 
solution: 

issue: oh btw@lukeczaplaI read your response to my queries last night, thanks for that :) 
solution: 

issue: lukeczapla: Is it generally bad to have large feature vectors? They are extremely sparse. Extremely as in ~50 values out of 250k contain actual values. (That arent 0) 
solution: 

issue: File > Project Structure > Libraries. might work 
solution: 

issue: Would it be possible for me to zip up my project folder and repository, send it to my prof and have it still work? or would it scream if he's missing maven 
solution: if making it easier on the professor is the goal, one sneaky way might be to use a bootable USB drive. 

issue: maven will help a lotYou guys really should listen to @lukeczapla . Maven will help a lot. There is a reason it is a standard tool.  [<-CODE->] Runs the sample you mentioned. 
solution: 

issue: are you planning on supporting docker? at last check the dl4j docker was not current.. 
solution: I'd almost wonder if a bootable USB drive might be a good idea. PITA to maintain though.... 

issue: if we keep outlining the problem, someone good at this will pick up on it and help out.  the posting an issue is the best way to get expert help but to me it looks like it might not have a proper LabelsSource constructor. 
solution: 

issue: Means that inside if my record reader the append label code has to be adjusted? 
solution: last argument should be true. 

issue: are you running 0.8.0? 
solution: i think there was issue with labels as NDArrayWritables that i’ve resolved few month ago. i think it’s preventing proper labels handling in your case. 

issue: is there any chance to speed up downloads from [<-LINK->] mirror in europe or so? :) raver119: ok... compiles... but here's the next exception UnsupportedOperationException: Multiple writables present but NDArrayWritable is not a row vector. Can only concat row vectors with other writables. Shape: [1, 1, 64, 128] 
solution: 

issue: Yeah I'm completely lost as how to achieve what I want with word2vec :( Feels like the easiest method is to implement my own sequenceiterator and just return my preparsed words, but even that is a lot of work raver119: Can you please help out here? I'm lost in this jungle. 
solution: Like...word2vec doesnt even use datavec. 

issue: raver119: If my Sentence class extends Sequence and Word extends SequenceElement, should I not be able to give that Builder my sentence iterator?  [<-CODE->] I can not get this to work. Iterable<Sentence> is incompatible with Iterable<Sequence<Word>> 
solution: 

issue: What are the benefits to using ND4S or ND4J if you are using Scala? 
solution: 

issue: Actually,@agibsoncccdo you know if ND4J is supported with Apache Toree on Jupyter? deeplearning4j/nd4j#1687So what is the uber jar? I'm getting the same error as in the issue when I try to use DL4J in Jupyter with Apache Toree I'm doing something like%AddDeps org.nd4j nd4j-native-platform 0.8.0 --transitive It's a magic function in Apache Toree that does a maven dependency. What would you recommend as a Jupyter kernel that supports Scala, Spark, and of course DL4J? 
solution: 

issue: I'm reading a CSV file with three columns. column [<-ISSUE->] and [<-ISSUE->] are of type string and column [<-ISSUE->] is of type charcter. I'm using the TransformProcess.Builder t convert the third column, which is a type, to int using the categoricalToInteger method. But there doesn't seem to be a method for converting the string columns to vector, or to numerical type, to use it for training. Any idea how to prepare my data for training please? 
solution: 

issue: and can I cut / paste the bulk of the sample pom into the pom of my new maven project? 
solution: 

issue: I'm still familiarizing myself with the format of the pom file. Are there specific sections that I should copy? Properties / Modules / Build? 
solution: I have been reading up on it. I misunderstood. You're saying that this: [<-LINK->] can be used as a starting point and that I need to add my dependencies to it, right?. Success!Created a new project, copied POM.XML from the examples project, tweaked it, brought over my basic classifier class, fixed the references to my source csv files and it runs!maven is like magic once you know how to use it. 

issue: hi folks... i\'m trying to run deeplearning4j as part of an image processing program called "Trainable Weka Segmentation". i\'m getting an error that says that ND4J is probably missing dependencies. any thoughts on how to troubleshoot this? hmm it looks like the problem might be in the wrapper someone wrote. i'll look elsewhere for help. 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I'm trying DL4j for training my neural network on macbook. Is there a way I can use my Intel iris GPU, as the training seems little slow? The documentation talks only about nvidia graphics. Thanks. 
solution: 

issue: @hackintehboxprints out how many times examples were properly classified (Examples labeled as X classified by model as X: 100 times).I'm trying to determine if there is a list/collection of those results anywhere.You can get the confusion matrix from the Evaluation instance using getConfusionMatrix() @sardarjafI'm using the TransformProcess.Builder... there doesn't seem to be a method for converting the string columns to vector, or to numerical typewhat representation are you looking for specifically? Do you want to assign an integer index to each work in vocab? use word vectors?

issue: Question: do INDArrays automatically create the correct dimensions when multiplying? Lets say I have one 1xN matrix and one NxM matrix, and I multiply the two, do I get a new matrix thats 1xM or how does it work? .mul()is what I used 
solution: 

issue: not sure what you want to handle here. "alone", "not alone", "was alone", "never alone" <-- it\'s all different n-grams 2) well, if you're building classifier, you'll need labelled documents to train classifier. i'm not sure how else could i explain paravec/word2vec are naive algorithms there's nothing to distinguish because n-grams are ALREADY different other story would be something like this "i\'m not alone today" vs  "i\'m alone today, not tomorrow" do some reading about paravec and w2v... 
solution: 

issue: yes, you fit the normalizer, then either (a) use setPreProcessor (for training), or (b) use transform method (inference etc)you can't normalize the image directly in the RecordReader, the API isn't designed that way. But again, you can use the transform method on the normalizer 
solution: 

issue: add some details please firasdib: ^^^ 
solution: i hadn’t heard of deadlocks in dl4j/nd4j for quite a while now.... 

issue: agibsonccc: sure :D but on localhost is working with much less memory and I have only one worker in my cluster and my batch size is 25. I mean I only load 1054 images. 
solution: 

issue: Ah I get it. So it's a 3D input, and I can figure it output by dividing it by layer size and input size? agibsonccc: Cheers, I'll try some stuff out. 
solution: jsteggink: come back later -@AlexDBlackwill be able to give you a more refined answer (he gets the masking bits better). GregaVrbancic: there's a bit more going on in your spark cluster though. 

issue: Please check out this guide to set up snapshots in your project: [<-ISSUE->] Please check out this guide to set up snapshots in your project: [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: that’s intentionally though.. 

issue: ok Ill also wait for the snapshot fixes... reverted to 0.8.0 but not the NumberFormatException pops up again... not = now 
solution: No... Windows... But because of missing macos deps build fails. use nd4j-native.

solution: 

issue: It looks like WordVectorSerializer should have a method overload of readWord2VecModel that accepts InputStream because otherwise runtime resources can't really be accessed.Is there a better way to access classpath runtime resources as files?\nIf not, should there be overloads for WordVectorSerializer in DL4J or is that a specific design decision?\nIf yes, how easy is it to add it in a PR? 
solution: 

issue: Is snapshot fixed for osx? I could an error for a missing jar earlier today If my loss function is jumping a lot, but still trending down, what should I do? 
solution: 

issue: lukeczapla: ,  i think this problem not only me have ,  when i change to nd4j-native, it still tips:  can not find org.nd4j:nd4j-native:jar:macosx-x86_64:0.8.1-SNAPSHOT,  also indeed [<-LINK->] has not that jar ,  could you upload the jar to the url? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] lukeczapla: . Am almost there. Just a lot of paperwork to do now. (Web app talking to DL4J over HTTP). 
solution: it\'s when the assignments get hard that this becomes more important, if someone copies someone\'sSystem.out.println("Hello world!");that\'s kinda pointless. 

issue: How to plot graph using Tsne in local machine? 
solution: 

issue: fredfredfred: actually, I wouldn\'t recommend looking at mnist data set iterator TBH, it won\'t help with implementing a custom record reader"where do the labels go" - again, concatenate it in the List<Writable>if you have string labels, you need to do the conversion to an integer index first getLabels() is entirely optional btw 
solution: 

issue: Test completed for CPU versus GPU time is the same. I was asked to run the same code or in this case model + surrounding code where the model is fed 273 blocks of 300x300 pixel images. I ran into the warning aout CUDAContexts not available and it was suggested to try avoid that by running on the CPU instead of the GPU that the performance difference would not be that great 
solution: yes. unless you have ancient gpu. 

issue: sudhiryadla: we don't have a RecordReader for handling arrays in JSON - we (or, you) would have to build it. JacksonRecordReader is 'one record per file' but could be a starting point

issue: Hi all, I'am a newbie with DL4J, I started with CSVExample. My problem is the learning with fit function, because I added 2 labels (total  3 instead of 1) for output with 2 classes instead of 3 in the csv file, I changed RecordReaderDataSetIterator constructor parameter values but it does not work. Where can I find help please ? Neither regression nor classification, but multiple outputs. Hi explored your guidelines, but is not an enjoy ;-) 
solution: If you want to multiple outputs trained on multiple loss functions you want to use a computation graph. I tried to use another constructor of RecordReaderDataSetIterator, now it run, but now, I don't now how too use Evaluation class.

issue: agibsonccc: hi, I'm wondering if a batch can be shared across multiple GPUs when training. I'm facing a problem where I want to use a bigger batch size but I cannot due to the size of my model and if I do, I run out of GPU memory. I thought of two possible solutions: use cpu with ram instead of GPU (obviously I want to avoid this because of how slow cpu training is), and the other is to use multiple GPUs but this would only work if I can share a single batch over multiple GPUs. Yes, mote RAM for the whole model, but not for each batch

solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: : No intention of forking nd4j. Planning to build an APL/J/K-like DSL that compiles down to nd4j calls. Also, yes, I saw 5+ options of calling rand -- I was just wondering "is this 0-1 just this particular impl, or something guaranteed to be [0,1]" That was my main concern for asking whether it's documented to be 0,1 (i.e., would it, in a future version, suddenly become [-1, 1]) 
solution: rev19: it already has lots of possible options.

issue: @agibsonccc : here are my top two wishes -- though they're probably not on critical path of skymind:nd4js -- training is expensive, eval is not -- if there was a js layer nd4js taht was compatible with nd4j, it'd be trivial to have my models do inference on website / mobile\nmath equations -> neural network // I never understood the gap between numpy/tensorflow/nd4j code ... vs math notation; if there was some way to just write the damn math formulas from research papers ... and 'exec' them as nd4j code, that'd be insane they use weblas and some other library whose name I forgot by \'math formula\', I mean thing like MS equation editor, not "math rewritte in ascii notation" if it's backed by a 10 B company, it doens't have to be 20+ years 
solution: in an ideal world, someone sets up [<-LINK->] so one can copy/paste formulas from research papers and have it turn into nd4j code. 

issue: so the user uploads an image, and I need to do OCR on it; my choice is either to send the img to the server and process it there // or just do it client side on the user's browser keras.js is built on weblas + scijs/ndarray, so it should suffice for my needs

issue: Hello@raver119I was running dl4j using nd4j-cuda-8.0 perfectly yesterday, today I switched to nd4j-native-platform to use CPU instead of GPU and it worked fine, but now I\'m trying to switch back to cuda and I keep getting this error "java.lang.RuntimeException: No CUDA devices were found in system".. do you know what could be going on? I tried refreshing maven and all dependencies but still the same All cuda paths are there 
solution: 

issue: raver119: I reinstalled everything and still no CUDA devices :( I downloaded a couple of utilities to verify CUDA was working properly and it is, all paths are present and all tests pass.. Can you think of anything that might be causing this? Some property or path? Here's a gist of my pom [<-LINK->]

solution: Are you adding another one?. 

issue: MatheusCalil: an issue or !gist with your full code is best way to help. I don't see where you're instantiating the configuration Ah just saw that. So these nets typically work out of the box with specific input shapes. There is meta data attached as an API that returns the default input Otherwise you'll want to hand configure your own That log doesn't give me an error 
solution: 

issue: crockpotveggies: But with that version with multiple outputs, how can I iterate my data? Since I can't use DataSetIterator 
solution: I'd suggest using a different pretrained network for simplicity. 

issue: i have a feature vector of 213 numerical variables and need binary classification based on them.  am i correct in using a dbn? if not can you point me to a network that will work best for me?

issue: I profiled my code a bit and see that a lot of time is being spent in Nd4j.concat(). I create a lot of INDArrays, put them in lists,and then usevstackorhstack. Is this a bad way of doing it? Or the best I can expect? 
solution: 

issue: Hello! I am a bit confused... I am running the same algorithm implemented in Java with ND4J library and implemented in python with numpy. The results are slightly different between those runs when i am using the same data. It depends on the programming language or actually i should invest the problem further? 
solution: 

issue: Could you comment on things on the page I gave you instead? :D I mean there are concrete steps there for basic things to check 
solution: 

issue: no, I don't believe that's possible even in principlethink about loading a serialized array from disk... the shape information just isn't availablesimilar issue if you define your arrays in one location, and pass them to a series of functions... the shape information just isn't available at compile time at runtime, sure. but again, at compile time you can't in general know the shape of the array - with some limited exceptions (like an Nd4j.create or reshape op in the current method). I think you'd be able to cover < 5% of cases with that sort of compile time checking 
solution: 

issue: @AlexDBlack : I just want to clarify: I make no claims for dynamic graphs. My very limited experience has been using TF (where the graph is almost always static), and, given the shape of every node in the graph is some linear combination (with floor/ceiling) of the dims of the input.I concede that dynamic graphs are useful, and there are situations where this won't work -- but in my limited experience with the examples in the 2-3 intro TF books I went through, they all satisfied these constraints.

solution: and release will be out in nearest days.. 

issue: For test purposes there is a binary pretrained model, a few res files like icons, a few classes (10-15) for keyboard, 2 classes for NN saudet: gonna try it now 
solution: 

issue: @saudet a few momentsAndroid Studio 3.0 introduced new Gradle, now annotationProcessors should be defined tooSo add to gradle dependencies:annotationProcessor "org.projectlombok:lombok:1.16.16".As there are some troubles with compilation, we also should exclude a few dependencies:configurations {    all.exclude module: \'jsr305\'    all.exclude module: \'jcip-annotations\'}If we are compiling snapshot versions, we should write dependencies like below as classifier doesn\'t work:compile group: \'org.nd4j\', name: \'nd4j-native\', version: \'0.8.1-SNAPSHOT-android-arm\'Maybe these moment should be in docs coz it took time for me to setup

solution: 

issue: uber jar + spark submit has always worked reliably for me... 
solution: 

issue: I can't figure out why I keep getting these NaN things after 10k iterations It looks reasonable all the way until that... 
solution: 

issue: If using Gradient clipping  properly (Elementwise like suggested by Mikolov )  there should not be any exploding gradients right ? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: hello! question: why the 0.8.1 is not in the github tags? :D ah so that's why the snapshot changed 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: Its giving me the following error : - Failure to transfer org.bytedeco.javacpp-presets:opencv:jar:linux-x86:3.1.0-1.3 from [<-LINK->] was cached in the localrepository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of central has elapsed or updates are forced. Yes i included only those in my pom file agibsonccc:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: maven is controllingallof your app right? not just the dl4j dependencies? I'm not going to support a weird 1 off config where you specified jars manually in an eclipse config yeah you have fun with that I'm not supporting that and you shouldn't expect me to that's a waste of my time 
solution: no one uses maven for a "subset" of their dependencies. 

issue: kindly go ahead, I have created a new small project to run word2vec only and it is maven based agibsonccc: Yes , new project is created and m2e is already installed from Eclipse->Help->Mearket-> Search m2e what do you mean by run through actual project setup, I am running from Eclipse->Run->Run as Java Application

issue:  [<-LINK->] agibsonccc: I just run this and got the following error. 
solution: 

issue: But have a nice sleep, i know that i need to know the internals but it seems that you allow more configuration then pytorch. Wile pytorch just uses some defualts.yea i have created some weird neural nets in pytorch :). like a character level rnn coupled to a linear layer to a sentence level rnn. pretty fun and it even worked. Oke i might have a look at that aswell. i will first set that l2 setting and regularisation :). that network i described was far to slow and complex thats why i chosed fasttext. 
solution: But i have to go as wel,  i'm glad you are here to help and you are really good at it.. 

issue: rev19: are you talking about in samediff? I am DEFINITELY open to ideas there I haven't really thought much about the formula representation I suck at "pretty" :D I was originally using that for an id..I haven't really did much with it since 
solution: 

issue: is there a method to return current iterations completed for a particular neural network?

solution: 

issue: Ezorrio: there is no jar files here like the other ones? I am executing it from a remote server so I am using the jars to load it to the zeppelin 
solution: yes, I am using that but in remote server, there are issues on zeppelin via corporate firewals. 

issue: can you speak in a layman's language? feels too high level for me. dl4j is definitely for large data set Thanks for your response, I will go get my answers from some 
solution: 

issue: hi.....are r-cnns the sucessor of cnns ? since I thought could use googles object detection api/models but they are all r-cnns and probably can't use in d4j? agibsonccc: ok, thx....but that means if I wanna know start with cnns in deep learning 4 j I could not build up on an existing (image) classification model ? 
solution: rcnns are for multi object detection within images. 

issue: To useParallelWrapperI need to change the platform to CUDA, if I understand the docs right. Will this still work on a multi-cpu config? Or what does this mean? 
solution: you can use it for cpu cores just fine. 

issue: Is one dataset supposed to be a minibatch? And if so, is the first parameter supposed to be the input matrix and the second the output matrix? I'm not entirely sure whatfeaturesMaskandlabelsMaskare 
solution: as far as i know one DataSet is one iteration of a batch of size N. 

issue: any examples for input reconstruction on the github? i can't find any

issue: I have Facebook vectors at hand, I want to use them with ParagraphVectors? Can I use them? I mean words and their vectors from facebook... I think initializing lookupTable should work?? 
solution: amd to use negative sampling you'll have to run pv fit anyway. 

issue: I already run fit but I want to initialize it with existing word vectors... is it possible.. It gives a warning when I initialize the vocabcache and lookuptable? during training (fitting)...is it normal.. I have an error on ParagraphVectors threads with vocabcache and lookuptable initialization.

issue: Hi guys, snapshot versions for dl4j and nd4j for osx are still broken? agibsonccc: thx. then I will try to build from source. I am waiting since friday to get the snapshot versions working and my product owner seems a little bit nervous about that .. :D 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys i am seeing the detectgender example here: [<-LINK->] it works perfectly but i must adapt it to my needs. My problem is that i have three class MALE/FEMALE/NO_GENDER the last means SURNAME. I do this classification after NER that gives me PERSON entities. This person's entity can be FULL NAME or NAME or SURNAME it is not a big problem because i can add data for surnames too 
solution: if you can have your corpus train on various permutations of first name middle surname as well as first name last name. 

issue: Christ, there is just no good solution to my data problem >.< Saving all the data to disk with Nd4j.write() is super slow, as is read. 
solution: last time i’ve checked reads - it was still in milliseconds. since deserialization is just sequential process. 

issue: deichbrise: what network mask you've put there? local training just works for me no matter what i try 
solution: this works for me. 

issue: Hi I get failed checksum for LeNet. [<-LINK->]

issue: not quite...  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Received mask array with shape [200, 360]; expected vector. this is in the fit step... 
solution: 

issue: I'm trying to cache (in memory) all my INDArrays to speed up training. This done incrementally, so after one epoch they should all be cached. Problem is, training during epoch 2 immediately results in NaN. I can't quite figure out why. Are INDArrays invalidated or something?

Gralde thinks they are the same.How can I pull android version of that lib? Or should I wait for 0.9.0 to appear at mavenCentral?Seems to be classifier issue again 
solution: 

issue: Hi Everyone, I need some help pleaseI have trained a classifier on Keras.When I import the model to dl4j and try to test (classify) an object, the resulted probability vector is not the same as in keras (loss in precision)Example: in keras the prob vector is [0.23, 0.27, 0.5] … in dl4j it gives [0.0,0.0,1.0].I need to know the exact value of the probabilities.Any help?

issue: I can't make work word2vec :( 
solution: 

issue: I can't to run the same example the two examples are in github in my project and i can't to run mvn clean install in the project dl4j-examples 
solution: 

issue: Since Convolution1D is not currently supported in the Keras model import module, is there a work-around or trickery to mask convolution1D layers using convolution2D, so that this model can be imported into DL4J? I'm following the tutorial from the Keras blog: [<-LINK->] My goal is to see if this example can be imported into DL4J. 
solution: but I've also said that if your etl is computationally heavy - you can get 2 devices for training, and one device for etl. 

issue: @/all0.9.0 going out just hit the button will take a bit to propagate thanks :D it's been 4 months lotta changes now hopefully we won't have as many asking for snapshots now at least it will calm down for a bit till we get snapshots to be more consistent :D

issue: raver119: @firasdibmaybe a slow malloc? what os is this? 
solution: yourkit shows way different values than visualvm. 

issue: hi, about custom loss function: if the gradient check passes around 30 checks and then stops with one error because it sligthly exceed the max relative error, means there is actually an error or might be still good? 
solution: 

issue: Great! You have to build your own model We aren't opencv If you understand that we are a  lower level library then I can at least point you at some of our image examples I'm not sure how you interpreted my phrase just now like that but ok No, I am saying we are not LIKE opencv We are a low level library You have to understand neural networks to build anything if you can't do that you will have to educate yourself with resources

issue: Hello, I have built a DL model with Keras and TensorFlow. Now, I want to import the model via DL4J as described here: [<-LINK->] ... If I just want to import the model and use it for inference, what are the minimum JARs I need? I already added deeplearning4j-modelimport , deeplearning4j-core and nd4j-native-platform ... Right now, my Eclipse project complains not finding the class MultiLayerNetwork when I write "MultiLayerNetwork network = KerasModelImport.importKerasSequentialModelAndWeights("PATH TO YOUR H5 FILE");"... I understand that there are Java Dependencies and I can use Maven to download all of them... Though, for just using a built model for inference, I thought, I maybe just need one or a few DL4J JARs in my project? 
solution: 

issue: Does ParallelInference do anything besides just eval the network on multiple threads? Should be less magic right, since its not training? 
solution: when you work with gpus. megachucky: just put that in a standard pom.xml setup. 

issue: hi, i'm trying to update to new 0.9.0 version. But sbt tryies to download also the 0.8.1-snapshot, and it fails. Any clue? If I set the version as 0.8.0 everything is fine and compile. my sbt build [<-LINK->]

solution: 

issue: when it will be up? Until that should we use 0.8.1? or will be 0.9.0 available with bugs? :) 
solution: 

issue: pythonBooker: not really. We do have a Convolution1D layer that should map properly to the one from keras 1.2.2 (and to Conv1D in keras >= 2 once ready), but we have to add that mapping to the existing import first  [<-ISSUE->] we had an attempt at this, but problems w/ resources. shouldn’t be too much work. I will tackle this soon enough. in the above PR apparently something didn’t work out, have to evaluate.

issue: raver119: My jvm is 1.8.0_121.  Is there anything specific I should check my target file for? 
solution: also, please check if you have enough free space on your target drive. 

issue: I'm pretty unfamiliar with Maven, so I apologize ahead of time if this sounds dumb.  But, by target file do you mean the directory of jar files that are generated when running the pom.xml?  If so, it looks like they're all there but they are version 0.7.2 (not 0.8.0).  Could that be the problem?  There's plenty of space on the target drive. ajohnsonz: I\'m using Ubuntu.  There definitely seems to be something weird with Maven ...when I tried running the command you suggested, I got an error saying[ERROR] Unknown lifecycle phase "build". 
solution: 

issue: Just switched from 8.1-SNAPSHOT to 0.9.9.... Where is CudaGradientsAccumulator gone? 0.9.0 ;) 
solution: old name was a bit misleading. 

issue: ajohnsonz: Okay, that worked!  After I rebuilt, I tried building a (tiny) model and then saving it with writeWord2VecModel, and it ran without errors.  I do have a question, looking at the size of the saved model relative to the size of the input file--is there a way to save the model in a more compact form?  I'm trying to build embeddings from a pretty massive corpus, and assuming the model size:input size ratio stays the same, my model file is going to end up being pretty huge. 
solution: 

issue: If my system is evaluating slowly, how could I speed the process up? 
solution: 

issue: I think the plain LSTM is significantly faster to train on GPU. I think our GravesLSTM uses peep connections? I think it can perform better with the same amount of training iterations.

It has port 0 in your snippet :[LAPTOP-0V9B4CN9/192.168.1.135:0] that's a very weird port to use, on a Unixoid, asking to bind TCP on port 0 indicates a request to dynamically generate an unused port number that doesn't make sense for a server that's supposed to run in a specific place

solution: 

issue: Intel Xeon CPU E5-2680 v3 is the most recent cpu you have there 12 cores from 2014. should be better then your i5 esp if your data is big enough

solution: 

issue: ok, got it. so the max number of threads is equal to the number of physical cores, which on the Opteron is 8 on my dev machine it uses 4 threads. but I guess those 4 are faster compared to the other 8 the freq of each is not THAT faster actually, why "way faster"? isn't it around 2GHz vs 3GHz? 
solution: I guess the only way to be sure is to benchmark all the nodes on the cluster. Intel Xeon CPU E5-2680 v3 is the most recent cpu you have there. 

issue: small as in each sample is small, or the whole dataset? each sample is small (20x40x3), the whole dataset is not 
solution: small dimensions of dataset. or 2. however that also depends on your nn arch. you might have large layers internally. 

issue: Thanks you for releasing 0.9.0! Just updating and it seems you still have some snapshot references out there in the wild (org.nd4j#nd4j-jackson;0.8.1-SNAPSHOT: not found). I will fix manually by adding the dependency with 0.9.0, but others might step into this as well.

issue: mparodi: i know faster way to do that :) set env variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to whatever you want firasdib: not a surprise, normalization takes time. 
solution: still wouldn't hurt to spruce up the docs in java though :D. usually if i hear that something used for year, isn't working for 1 person only. 

issue: Is there a 0.9.0 snapshot? righto 
solution: 

issue: Yes i know that cnns are for image processing etc but there is a recent research for protein secondary structure prediction using cnn I am just trying to tune the cnn with all the kernel and stride params so it will be able to be trained on protein sequences 
solution: you have the right idea with csvs. 

issue: The RELU init looks pretty similar to Xavier. I need to checkout the paper by He et al. 
solution: 

issue: pyhong: mind clarifying? Do you mean getting the code out? oumoussmehdi: you are mixing versions of nd4j there are zero scenarios where that's valid make them all 0.8.0 
solution: 

issue: Hi everyone, i am trying to spark-submit my dl4j application, but i keep getting this exception at the level of MultiLayerConfiguration: Java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError caused by No jnind4jcpu in java.library.path. and here is my pom.xml: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys, does dl4j have any built-in loss functions that support weights, or do I have to write my own? 
solution: 

issue: If I write my own loss function, would the correct approach be to have 'classAlabel, classBlabel, classAweight, classBweight' as my labels, then a '1 1 0 0' as the mask, and multiply the weights by the labels, calculate the score, then apply the mask? 
solution: 

issue: hey folks, the 0.9.0 release on maven links nd4j 0.8.1-Snapshot releases, therefore not usable. is this known? couldn't find any issue or mention related to this. 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: looking at the code for LossMCXENT, it seems I can use the mask to do per-example multiplication of the output in score and gradient calculations - would this work as a sort of "weighted" output? AlexDBlack: thanks, I already have a sort of custom evaluator that I've been using on the validation set so I'll give that a try luizcruzjf: if you are using images, why do you want to shuffle? luizcruzjf: separate your images into 2 or 3 folders, training set, cv set and test set, then have a separate datasetiterator for each folder - that would be my suggestion validation

issue: Hi, I have rather complex net config I'd like to GradientCheck. During test I get this from GradientCheckUtil:GradientCheckUtil.checkGradients(): 3746 params checked, 874 passed, 2872 failed. Largest relative error = 1.0How can it be that around 20% pass and rest fail? 
solution: 

issue: basically, [<-LINK->] is closer keep up the awesome work with nd4j though, I really enjoyed our discussions 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I have a model created by my colleague in Keras 2, Is there any other lternate options to import that in java till dl4j suporrts comes? 
solution: agibsonccc: Play is excluding logback.... 

issue: AlexDBlack: Thank you, this info helps me a lot. 
solution: 

issue: I got out of memory issue when i trained 500 images ( size of each image 988KB ) in IntelliJ using ConVolutional net. Vm settings in IntelliJIdea - -Xms256m -Xmx10gThe application is running in laptop - RAM : 12 GB . Please help raver119: more details regarding error message related to memory issue or my application? 
solution: raver119: I didn't copy the trace . Run the model again . After getting the crash i will come back. Thanks. 

issue: Hi, I downloded dl4j-examples and try to run Word2VecSentimentRNN.java but I got an error saying "CUDA backend can\'t find NVCC within PATH environment variable" what should I do? agibsonccc: what should I do then? I've already installed CUDA from the NVIDIA web sites. I installed CUDA 8.0, but still showing the same error am I missing something here? 
solution: 

issue: did you install cuda? 
solution: 

issue: @AlexDBlackI get this from GradientCheckUtil: GradientCheckUtil.checkGradients(): 3746 params checked, 874 passed, 2872 failed. Largest relative error = 1.0 How can it be that around 20% pass and rest fail?that's actually common. for example output layer gradients could pass, but a lower layer might have wrong backprop implementation what's the context here? custom layer or one of ours?Only dl4j stuff. I think what's unusual are the two output heads - one regression and one classification, mebbe this causes the issue?here's the gist: https://gist.github.com/fahman/1034cc36b3a8c31e3ad903613e3d2c48 Only dl4j stuff. I think what's unusual are the two output heads - one regression and one classification, mebbe this causes the issue? (see the gist above) 
solution: 

issue: so it's definitely failing on 0.8.0 for me (native)... and passing on masterI don't know what we did to fix it though - I can't recall any bug fixes or changes to those layers after 0.8.0 :/ unless it was something at the nd4j level that was the cause, which got identified and fixed some other way 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys, I'm trying to write my own custom log function and I want to pass in some additional columns along with my labels - how can I do it? If I have, say, 3 columns at the 'end' of my row, 2 of which are labels, if I set the 'number of classes' to 2 it gives me a mismatched input size because it seems to count the 3rd column as input. If I put the number of classes as 3 then it gets confused because I only have 2 classes to predict from (binary classifier) How do I take the 3rd column and pass it in as, for example, a mask? I can't find a constructor for CSVRecordReader that will allow me to specify a 'mask' column *custom loss function 
solution: It says on there that the MultiDataSet has masks for RNNs, but mine is a simple MLN. 

issue: Hi! I'm trying the variational auto-encoder example on wordvectors (my aim is to use it as dimensionality reduction), I already switched to GaussianReconstructionDistribution with a TANH activation to cover [-1,1] values, any other function, activation & hyperparameter suggestions to make it work? My current VAE can't seem to produce any sensible latentSpace as the cosine from input to output if close to 0. Thanks Susan, any idea when he's back? 
solution: 

issue: as to your question: hm, I'm not sure how well VAE will work with word vectors tbh 
solution: 

issue: IsaacChanghau: got a link to the paper? IsaacChanghau: unfortunately I think that would have to be a custom layer... they've changed the definition of the LSTM unit, so you can't just build it out of a stack of layersbuilding a custom LSTM like that would be possible, but would be quite difficult... here's the main code for our LSTM, to give you an idea: [<-LINK->] 
solution: fyi - [<-LINK->] for now, manually add logback to your pom. Looks like we're excluding it in deeplearning4j-play (which isn't going to work for most people given the above issue). 

issue: right, it's specific to VGG pretrained models, I believe. I wouldn't call that best practice for training a new net from scratch, with something like xavier/relu inits ImagePreProcessingScaler is probably fine, -1 to 1 or 0 to 1 
solution: 

issue: hi@AlexDBlacksome time ago I posted a follow-up question  to [<-ISSUE->] (about model interpretability). I wonder if you would have time to have a look at it? I also created another issue  ( [<-ISSUE->] ) that is somewhat related to 3568. If you could provide some insight there too, that would be great. Thanks a lot in advance 
solution: 

issue: firasdib: I've had something similar where I've built an uberjar with maven and it's overwritten some metadata files firasdib: this is also quite helpful if you've not used shade before [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Hi@AlexDBlack, related to #issue3804 you opened yesterday, it seems that for feedForward inputType the batchdim seems to be in position 0 and for convolutional InputType, the batchdim is in postion 3. Is that correct? 
solution: 

issue: How do I build my JAR now? 
solution: you delete the assembly completely. you switch it with shade. 

issue: Hi there, I'm having exactly the sames issue as@manneshiva. CPU-Z just show no GPU usage. 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: getting terrible perf with the dropout layers :( 
solution: 

issue: Any reason whymodel.setUNK("foo")does not work? model.setUNK("foo"); System.out.println(model.getUNK());prints "UNK" not "foo" poke@raver119 
solution: ill open an issue so he wont miss it. 

issue: AlexDBlack: currently i run a MultiLayerNetwork program on a spark cluster bigger then previous with 10 nodes ,  but the driver program is very slow , any general idea can you suggest me to check ? AlexDBlack: this is the driver program  [<-LINK->] 
solution: jasstionzyf: well, of course - if you use parallelize, you're limited to driver memory, and it's all single threaded. try this instead: JavaRDD<DataSet> data = sc.textFile("path").map(new StringToWritablesFunction(new CsvRecordReader(...)).map(new DataVecDataSetFunction(...));. 

issue: Hi, when running Word2VecSentimentRNN.java I got an error "No CUDA devices were found in system", what should I do? Do I really need to have CUDA device installed If I just want to run the Word2VecSentimentRNN.java example ? 
solution: 

issue: that's a normal error related to memory that example takes a lot of memory 
solution: 

issue: On a strangely related note, why do I keep getting checksum errors followed by LOC errors when I try to download the dl4j dependencies through Maven?  I keep having to delete that folder in .m2 and hoping that it downloads correctly this time. I wiped out my javacpp cache and my .m2, rebuilt the project, reran it, and now get the same error but for 8.0:Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: C:\\Users\\josep.javacpp\\cache\\cuda-8.0-6.0-1.3-windows-x86_64.jar\\org\\bytedeco\\javacpp\\windows-x86_64\\jnicuda.dll: Can't find dependent libraries 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: i use your way since the train data is split to each spark workers,  the driver memory reduce a lot , but also treeAggregate at ParameterAveragingTrainingMaster.java:819   this method  take a lot time , also when this spark stage running ,  all other spark workers seems nothing to do ,  is this normal? agibsonccc: treeAggregate at ParameterAveragingTrainingMaster.java:819   this spark job is very slow,  do you have any general suggestion ? 
solution: 

issue: Please check out this guide to set up snapshots in your project: [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: So maven still says 0.9.0 - but I suppose that will still pull 0.8.1 binaries? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: @eralyI changed normalization to ImagePreProcessingScaler(-1,1) but it still didn't helped. I also tried two best models with different score but I got same evaluation.  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Just let the front end do the math then? If the user opens it the math is done there. If its closed nothing is done in vain. And in the end i'm jus giving you feedback, you do whatever you want with it. Its not my product, im completely unaffected by it. To each their own, right :) 
solution: has betwen 40m and 140m params. that's up to 500mb floats. well, vgg16-like model. 

issue: and add 3x params size, for gradients and updater state so that's 2GB to send to front end 
solution: and yes, those stats are for the front-end only (though, by design, they can be collected and NOT visualized, until later - which we use a lot). 

issue: dgl85: are you using GPU? 
solution: dgl85: double precision is VERY slow on consumer-grade gpus. Yes, I can see that ;). 

issue: dgl85: one (easy, but not super elegant) workaround - just take the current (nd4j master) and add it to your project as a custom loss function 
solution: 

issue: Could you suggest some dropout? When I set dropout to 0 it means it is not performing dropout? 
solution: One more question. When I set dropout for whole network (for example from zoo) will it change dropout setting for layers which has already dropout set?. 

issue: Remember dl4j wants an inverted dropout value. So if you want 40% dropout you need to give it 0.6 (Its the probability ofretainingan activation, not the probability of dropping it) 
solution: 

issue: Has anybody run into the error of IndexOutOfBoundsException when running the TrainNews.java example with other data? Here is my error output on Gist: [<-LINK->] 
solution: Yeah it came with DL4J-examples. it's probably one of community contributions. 

issue: Do any of you guys have references on performance improvement of a ditributed model running over multiple gpu compared to running on a single gpu? I'm assuming that if you train on 2 gpus performance will not be 2x. I've been searching this for a while but can't find any benchmarks. 
solution: 

issue: is it weird that my package is called edu.dnatools?  I see org.and com., etc., am I an odd one out? errr those were supposed to be stars ok fair enough 
solution: 

issue: im sitting through some Java teachers' conference this week.  I didnt realize how incompetent they all are, even the coordinator 
solution: I dont want to do this for 20+ years and become arrogant because of all that experience, like these coordinators. 

issue: hey guys i'm new here i found this library about two weeks ago and have been fiddling around with it since so far i was able to manage with the help of the tutorials i just have a few questions specifically about neural networks i'm having problems when i'm trying to build an unsupervised network i'm using the VariationalAutoEncoderExample.java as a template but i'm trying it with a different dataset however I keep running into the issue of scores blowing up or vanishing after a few hundred iterations the scores would either be displayed as NaN or infinity 
solution: 

issue: it has to match my input data?? I have a csv file with 20000 lines and 21 columns the 21 is the label so the parameters should be 20000,20? 
solution: 

issue: I have these two folders in my m2 folder:0.8.1-SNAPSHOT/ 0.9.0/ Is it possible to force maven to use 0.9.0? Maybe if I delete 0.8.1 and use-oflag? 
solution: agibsonccc: I thought the issue was you were pulling old versions from maven, so a config issue. Not an actual issue with the lib.. 

issue: lukeczapla: which one is... easier to get into?  I'm not too familiar with linux development (although I've had limited general use of linux) 
solution: 

issue: I have pre trained and I set in resources that work for me but in docker it show error can't mkdir .dl4j/vgg16 something like that what does it mean 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: looking at the pooling layer you pointed out is supposed to be used after the LSTM layer (as input=3d and output =2d), am I mistaken? 
solution: 

issue: you can't do that though you need to reshape it to 2d somehow the architecture I just posted does that the pooling also auto handles the shapes lukeczapla: thanks! 0.9.1-SNAPSHOT yeah I mean even nd4j would be helpful for sure 
solution: agibsonccc: and in your snippet, how\'s handled the first layer called "dense0"? The shape is 2d, right? Is the output automatically copied for each timestep of the underlying LSTMs?. 

issue: Using ND4J is there an efficient way to export an INDArray to a Java array that matches the dimensions? I'm trying to send it over an API call as JSON, but I didn't see anything in the javadoc for that, except directly to a file that's true, I would just have to send the dimensions as well thank you for the assistance 
solution: 

issue: Hello everyone, I am new to dl4j, I have read the documentation, checked the issues on github and tried to do some googling before posting the issue, I have modified the LenetMnistExample to use different dataset for video classification, while running the code I get the error java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to get number of of columns for a non 2d matrix, I will appreciate an insight into what I am doing wrong.The source is here https://gist.github.com/ayobami/7a5216246e958e4e00d31b6d45656ea0 
solution: 

issue: In the Tensorflow Scaling slide of [<-LINK->] , it appears that TF scales linearl ywith # of GPUs. Does ND4j GPU backend support this? (I was under impression ND4j GPU backend can only be used for model averaging.) 
solution:

solution: 

issue: mdnoorit: do you have a whole report of which jars have CVES attached to them? We can do an audit this is really handy thank you the 3rd party apache deps would be good to do an overview of for us mdnoorit: could you put this  report in an !issue? thanks a lot, we shouldn't have folks doing that themselves normally sorry about that!

issue: Hello there, I'm trying to retrieve specific embeddings from a h5 file with the Hdf5Archive class methods ( [<-LINK->] ). The architecture of my h5 file, when I open it with Panoply is below (and also above, sorry for that). I can get the groups (dens_1, etc.), but can't get the function readDataSet to work in order to get the corresponding arrays (dense_1_b).  I get [<-LINK->] .  I've tried many combinations of group as parameter, with no result, hence my question. Model was trained with Keras - Theano. I use nd4j : 0.9.1-SNAPSHOT, nd4j backend : nd4j-cuda-8.0-platform, Linux Java 1.8 and Maven 3.3.9. Any hint ?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: suppose i have a feature vector of 20 elements.  and i have only 6 of those elements.  how would i produce a "statistically typical" 20-element feature vector based on the fact those 6 are set already? so say i have the problem i just described, would i be able to fill in missing elements with reasonable and sensible values using an autoencoder? provided i used 0 for the missing elements 
solution: the idea is a user would be able to input values.  the actual feature vector is 216 elements long and  so i can't expect a user to sit there entering data for 15 minutes.  so unfortunately binning the 6 values won't work :(. 

issue: Hi guys, a quick question: I checked the javadoc for INDArray and it seems there is a percentileNumber that computes percentiles but can't find it in the 0.8.0 code, was this added later, in 0.9.1-snapshot? thanks! :)

solution: 

issue: when run the training I got this error, what does that mean? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: jasstionzyf: looking through your config - I don't see any configuration of extra memory overhead... there should be some config like (or equivalent to) spark.yarn.executor.memoryOverhead for the off-heap memory?you can configure javacpp all you like, but if there's not enough off-heap memory available to the process, you'll still get OOMs jasstionzyf: right, but with yarn at least the executors run in containers, that have their own memory limits (hence the memory config overhead configuration)not sure on standalone though 
solution: 

issue: crockpotveggies: @firasdibthat depends on dimensionaility & orders. i.e. if that’sSAME ORDERfor both arrays - i wouldn’t expect any serious bottleneck in native impl how big are they? in terms of NDArray shape?

solution: 

issue: pontusstjerna: mind posting the whole trace as a !gist ? pontusstjerna: no please don't do that :D just use 0.8.0 (unless your team was using snapshots for some reason) 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: ,  after i reduce layers num,  obviously the train speed much quick,  as the network larger ,  the much bottleneck is broadcast values  transfer between the driver and executors,     also use the G1GC,  seems better .  memory issues not happen yet , will continue to mointer the program sure, feel pleasure to do that , give me some time after i think the program is stable enough

solution: /opt/intel is the one you want if you can. 

issue: raver119: I have the simplified version of the code that reproduces the NullPointerException error related to the min max normalizer; however, i messed a little bit with the pom, got it back in the previous version that reproduced the bug and now it can't find nd4j backend on classpath so I can't reproduce it anymore :(  should I wait for the new release or would this be useful to put in an issue as the code stands right now? ok! 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys, can anyone tell me what this is exactly doing in the EarlyStoppingConfiguration?.epochTerminationConditions(new MaxEpochsTerminationCondition(100), new ScoreImprovementEpochTerminationCondition(5)) is there a way to do an early stopping if the test error is increasing for N consecutive epoch? (is it what ScoreImprovementEpochTerminationCondition is doing?) I was not able to find formal documentation on this 
solution: 

issue: firasdib: try without the -pl '!:deepleanring4j-cuda-8.0', and let me know how it goes (in an issue if I'm not answering instantly) /cc@agibsonccc firasdib: usually when you see a complaint saying it can't find my-project in the reactor,  it means my-project is not scheduled for compilation 
solution: 

issue: luizcruzjf: score improvement on training error? (that shouldn\'t increase by design)I also see we can add this: ".scoreCalculator(new DataSetLossCalculator(mnistTrain, true)) " is it what ScoreImprovementEpochTerminationCondition is based on?) OK thank you. training loss function score can increase with epoch? thank you. (assuming learning rate is good) I didn't mean to questioning this. My question was mainly about having early stopping triggered using test error (or training AND testing)

issue: Please check our examples: [<-LINK->] or [<-LINK->] alimt1992: Welcome! Here's a link to Deeplearning4j's Gitter Guidelines, our documentation and other DeepLearning resources online. Please explore these and enjoy! [<-LINK->] Hypothetically i could understand what you say, but we're not there yet. I'm just a bot :( Please check our examples: [<-LINK->] or [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: I have a maven problem. I am trying to use 0.9.0. "mvn clean install" fails with[ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project dcnn: Could not resolve dependencies for project net.gowrite:dcnn:jar:1.0: Failed to collect dependencies at org.deeplearning4j:deeplearning4j-core:jar:0.9.0 -> org.datavec:datavec-api:jar:0.8.1-SNAPSHOT -> org.nd4j:jackson:jar:0.9.1-SNAPSHOT: Failed to read artifact descriptor for org.nd4j:jackson:jar:0.9.1-SNAPSHOT: Failure to find org.nd4j:nd4j-shade:pom:0.9.1-20170812.072052-44 in https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of sonatype-nexus-snapshots has elapsed or updates are forced -> [Help 1]After simplifying the pom a while I ended up with thishttps://gist.github.com/lpaatero/792e0d511bea9b8074701df8734668feIt still produces the error. I do not see why SNAPSHOTs get involved at all with build. 
solution: 

issue: How stable is the 0.9_spark_1 release? I have to pull updated version anyway, so if 0.9 is stable I'll skip 0.8 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: when i use 0.9.1,  has following error: Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: org.nd4j.linalg.factory.Nd4jBackend$NoAvailableBackendException: Please ensure that you have an nd4j backend on your classpath. Please see: [<-LINK->] at org.nd4j.linalg.factory.Nd4j.initContext(Nd4j.java:6003)at org.nd4j.linalg.factory.Nd4j.<clinit>(Nd4j.java:200)... 3 more agibsonccc: current 0.8.1 snapshot seems has some issues ,  i  decide not to use 0.9.1 currently for previously i make 0.8.1-snapshot work as my way in spark cluster , i spent lot time to  change  some pom related with dl4j especially for kryo-serializers ,  my pom : [<-LINK->] 
solution: you have variable declarations in some places and not other. 

issue: fyi: 0.9.1 Examples just build fine from the command line. Having this little kerfuffle with IntelliJ and Maven. Doubt that is a DL4J issue though. 
solution: 

issue: I have not been able to fix my error related to the UIserver UIServer.getInstance(); give the error:Exception in thread "main" com.typesafe.config.ConfigException$UnresolvedSubstitution: reference.confCould not resolve substitution to a value: ${play.server.dir} Is it a known issue?

issue: woo, let me try it@raver119 raver119: Can you please help me with MKL on Linux? ND4J is not picking it up.  [<-CODE->] What else do I need to do? Inside that folder islibmkl_rt.so 
solution: 

issue: hm...I'm currently wanna use the 0.9 version // https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-corelibraryDependencies += "org.deeplearning4j" % "deeplearning4j-core" % dl4jVersion// https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.nd4j/nd4j-cuda-8.0libraryDependencies += "org.nd4j" % "nd4j-cuda-8.0-platform" % nd4jVersion if I set the version for both to 0.8 all works, if I set it to 0.9 I get [error] unresolved dependency: org.nd4j#jackson;0.8.1-SNAPSHOT: not found 
solution: 

issue: Hi I have tried the code in this page.  [<-LINK->] DenseLayer does not has Build() method DenseLayer inputLayer = new DenseLayer.Builder().nIn(2).nOut(3).name("Input").build(); not works 
solution: 

issue: Can you try running /opt/intel/bin/compiler_vars.sh intel64 ? firasdib:  [<-LINK->] fwiw here is a docker container with everything pre built (also has cuda :D) mind running your build again after running that? fwiw this is what a successful build looks like end to end: [<-LINK->] your box is cursed lol Can you see if you can get your admin to install docker? 
solution: well at least the release is out. 

issue: Is it possible to install deeplearning4j on Oracle's Solaris OS(Unix)? My OS version is Solaris 11.3 and I think I\'ve already installed all prerequisites successfully.I got this error message when I tried to "mvn clean install" on  the dl4j-examples project. [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: When is "Deep Learning: A Practitioner\'s Approach" expected to be released? 
solution: 

issue: SangeethaManiam: yeah don\'t do that..just get your pictures in to 2 directories 1 with "filled" and "not filled" that will be easier and I think will be more realistic for you 
solution: 

issue: OK, I will keep these questions for my further study also. Also sometimes do not know what to ask . Lot to study 
solution: 

issue: Hi I need to use a pretrained caffe model in dl4j. As I understood I have to convert caffemodel to keras. But I can't find a way to do that I'm trying to import a pre trained vgg16 model from [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Guys I\'ve found tens of thousands of files in my temp folder called "tempcopy8433413772100754847temp" and stuff like that - I am assuming from the timestamps that these are created by DL4J - are they safe to delete once I\'ve shut down my DL4J module? 
solution: 

issue: hm... I wouldn't be so sure they are from DL4J - I don't have any matchin that name in my temp dir... right, we definitely don't use/require anything (between JVM instances, anyway) in temp directories 
solution: 

issue: !issue 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: I've been doing a bunch of perf work with raver and we've managed to improve a lot of perf in nd4j. However, the dropout layer solution I made adds 50% overhead, and I think there is something not 100% right there. He's a bit busy today, so just wanted to check it with you if you have time. 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: Ok thank you. I have another question. Just for checking I created a small ComputationGraph: [<-LINK->] But when I run those few lines, I get this error: [<-LINK->] Do you have any idea why? Thank you for your support. 
solution: 

issue: afefCH: right..but you are looking for a "1 line answer" it doesn\'t exist dl4j isn't opencv if you want a solution that just works with no training then use something higher level You have to get your own training data and the like..please try to come back with a less broad question 
solution: usually a layer is the last thing in a network...an issue (i.e., bug) with vertices as the last output is the only thing I can think of that might cause that. 

issue: StefanoSamele: it might be an edge case with a vertex as the output, not sure... I'd have to run it and check.mind opening an issue? thanks. I just pushed a fix for reshapeVertex too, fyi 
solution: 

issue: If I have my model, can I get the current dropout value of a specific layer? model.getLayerWiseConfigurations().getConf(2).getLayer().getDropOut();maybe? where 2 is the layer with id 2 hmm no that didnt work agibsonccc: do you know how I can get the dropout value for a given layer? trying to output it in a listener cant ge tit to work, just get 0.0 iterationDoneis given aModel, can I get my value through it? 
solution: 

issue: Hey, whats the fix for the jnicuda dependency issue? 
solution: ThePrimedTNT: start with posting your pom.xml and full stack trace as !giat. 

issue: rev19: please don't ask these things if you aren't going to actually use nd4j :D we have a a gym environment with dl4j already in place called rl4j 
solution: 

issue: is there something wrong with dropout in 0.9.1? Whenever I try to use it my VRAM consumption maxes out and cuda crashes It happens whether I apply globally or to each specific layer 
solution: 

issue: Dromit: the labels are created in the datasetiterator not the record reader 
solution: 

issue: JZ051: show your pom.xml and source code as !gist please 
solution: 

issue: JZ051: please upgrade to 0.9.1 and enable !workspaces you should be fine after that 
solution: 

issue: raver, could you explain to me in some simple sentences, what is causing this memory problem? Because I don't see how this could happen in my code, as I reinitialize everything from scratch (not for memory reasons, but because it is a repeated experiment), thus the GC should throw the old stuff away I thought? Why does the GC/JVM keep stuff between loops? I have just updated dl4j and nd4j to 0.9.1 yes no i dont want lengthy explanations about on- and off-heap memory etc., there are plenty of articles about that in the net, no problem you mean, JUST updating may be enough? i wanted to integrate workspaces into my code 
solution: 

issue: !snapshots 0.9.2-SNAPSHOT did not work for me :(. [<-CODE->] Config otherwise the same as 0.9.1 
solution: 

issue: and if snapshots - what os is used? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: if I useasync = true, does the iterator execute in its own thread or how does it work? raver119: I fixed the memory cache thing, but its only a temporary fix. I really don't like it. raver119: Have you played with mmap? Do you think it would help with presaving data to a file and then reading from disk? Or would it be slow af? 
solution: 

issue: open source code maybe? :) we're not hiding it :) 
solution: 

issue: is there any what to visualize my neural network structure ? 
solution: 

issue: firasdib: you should just calculate your memory requirements, and multiply them by 2 (since you want to have more then 1 memory set available in circular workspace) firasdib: hypothetically it should be faster then ser/de HYPOTHETICALLY cqiaoYc: stdout shouldn’t ever cause memleaks. it’s just stdout. Wilwilly: you’ve got any problems with that approach, or what? afaik that’s usually some file s not a memory so there’s lots of readers etc serious data never fits in to ram :( 
solution: 

issue: I'm completely lost on Async iterators. I'm trying to useJointParallelDataSetIteratorbut can't reset my backing iterator. So I created a thin wrapper that will handle the reset for me. The idea is that it will shuffle my dataset and do the necessary computations, update the backing iterators and reset everything else. But for some reason, one epoch passes and then it stops working. No idea why And its driving me a little bit mad :) agibsonccc: Would you have any idea? 
solution: 

issue: My memory ticket is here: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] dl4j is open source :D I mean..there's not much more to say 
solution: 

issue: and higher jcpp maxbytes option@raver119, what option is that? I can't find anything about that 
solution: 

issue: I'm confused about something. Is the data in a SequenceRecord (or Record) forced to be a number at some point? I'm asking because I've seen a sequence could be as simple as a list of a list of a list of Writable, but that interface is just a serializable (which may have many fields) ie, I expected a sequence to be a List<List<List<? extends Number>>>, but that's not the case 
solution: the end goal no matter what ends up being an ndarray. 

issue: I'm not getting it. How is it going to be fed to a network if I use List<List<List<Foo>> as my data, where Foo is a POJO which has a String x and a Integer y? 
solution: datavec is purely for ETL/pre processing. usually the recordreader handles all of these things for you. 

issue: Hi everyone! When moving to 0.9.1 I'm getting a download failed: org.bytedeco.javacpp-presets#openblas;0.2.19-1.3!openblas.jarAny idea? 
solution: 

issue: Wilwilly: yes - the latter approach allows you to not have it all in memory at the start of training 
solution: 

issue: Hey i was wondering if someone could help me with ND4J. I'm building the dependency with gradle but no matter how many different ways I try, it never builds the full dependency so like i have access to NDArray, but i can't make and INDArray or DataSety Does anyone know what the problem might be? Is this common? 
solution: 

issue: Still that should be updated :D Ancient stuff 
solution: and check examples link i’ve posted above. 

issue: hi...I have a neural net with 2 independent inputs is there any example that uses 2 input layers and use multiple datasets 
solution: :(. addition rnn. 

issue: oh no sorry, i just wanted the link for submitting my own 
solution: 

issue: ironflood: it works fine AFAIK, what error do you get? 
solution: 

issue: jasstionzyf: what are you deploying on? centos 4? :D hm I wonder how/why omp is being linked in cuda yeah that's not your problem it's complaining about openmp 4 jasstionzyf: could you file an !issue so@saudetcan look at it later? put your configuration, os, error message,.. up there 
solution: 

issue: I'm looking for a computer game that:is written in Java\nhas a nice BOT-ing API (get health, weapon info, visible world, ...)==> basically something that would be fun to test ND4J deep reinforcement learning algorithms onAny suggestions ? agibsonccc: : is [<-LINK->] complete bindings? I thought this was work in progress 
solution: 

issue: as a founder, I'd make the same choices, in developing my app, I'm very heavily considering: 1) who can pay and 2) how much expected customer service time said group requires makes sense, a company should: 1. make a list of potential customer; 2. sort them by (how much they will pay) / (how much effort to make them happy) , and for hobbyists, it's basically 0 / int_max semi related question; given all the advances in dl for human language translation, how many years away do you think we are from neural nets that take python as input and spit out java ? 
solution: 

issue: Hi! Using 0.9.1. I\'m getting a warning in IntelliJ  for many dl4j and nd4j classes when I go into the source for them: "Library source does not match the bytecode for class ...". Happens for e.g. AdaDelta, VersionCheck, but not for BaseNDArraay or DataBufferLogEntry (just picked some files). Happens for MultiLayerConfiguration but not WeightInit.. Any idea?

issue: Hi, I have tried to load image by NativeImageLoader in android.However error below is showed.How to solve it?Error:(71, 37) error : BufferedImage can not be accessed.java.awt.image.BufferedImage can not be founded. 
solution: I think we might have fixed that. 

issue: Hello. Is it possible to set "-Dorg.deeplearning4j.config.custom.enabled=false" during runtime instead of using an argument while starting? 
solution: 

issue: Hello to all! Has anyone ever tried DP4J to implement rules-based machine learning? Thanks Actually the purpose is to build an alternative to drools using ML :) agibsonccc: actually the purpose is to build an alternative to drools using DL4J 
solution: 

issue: Hi@agibsonccc.  I installed the current version of dl4j, and my word2Vec on 57000 words did not GC, but it did nothing after 100 iterations.  I used Xmx24G.  any suggestions? heres the code: void plotData(Word2Vec vec, String outputTsne, int numWords){File output = new File (outputTsne);BarnesHutTsne tsne = new BarnesHutTsne.Builder().setMaxIter(1000).stopLyingIteration(250).learningRate(500).useAdaGrad(false).theta(0.5).setMomentum(0.5).normalize(true)//  .usePca(false).build();vec.lookupTable().plotVocab(tsne, numWords, output); [<-CODE->] (except with 100 in setmaxiter and in stoplyingiteration) 
solution: 

issue: I'm trying to import a model with DL4J but i'm getting this error:org.deeplearning4j.nn.modelimport.keras.InvalidKerasConfigurationException: Could not determine number of outputs for layer: no output_dim or nb_filter field found. I checked the json file i'm importing though and everything looks like it's fine? any ideas? 
solution: I think he finished the json but not the weights yet. 

issue: agibsonccc: @AlexDBlackIf I understand this correctly, looks like we are good. I just needed to add a RELU layer to the basic RNN implementation in the example set.Test set evaluation at epoch 0: Accuracy = 1.00, F1 = 1.00Test set evaluation at epoch 1: Accuracy = 1.00, F1 = 1.00 But when I fix the seed I am back to 0.5 for accuracy and f1 
solution: 

issue: is there any helper method/class to save a DataSet in CSV or any other format to check the data after some transformations and normalization? 
solution: since ndarray can be printed out etc. 

issue: dunno. have you filed an issue? if yes - was it implemented/closed? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: it looks a bit unstable... starts with 1.0 accuracy first epoch and then with every subsequent epoch, accuracy drops. That's with a fixed seed. 
solution: 

issue: My project can't find org.datavec.api.split.FileSplit, im using  version 0.8.1-SNAPSHOT. What i'm missing? 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys, can somebody confirm something for me... I seem to recall reading that DL4J allows for incremental training of an existing model with new data.  Is that indeed the case, or is my memory off? 
solution: mindcrime: Yes: You can call the fit method as often as you want.. Yeah, I\'m doing the "build a toy project" thing as we speak.  :-)  Just wanted a little sanity check.. 

issue: grayhaired: what error do you get when calling setting the listener field of the conf of rl4j? 
solution: 

issue: a transform process? that's how you manipulate data you don't do it with ndarrays 
solution: agibsonccc: I've created issue as you suggested. Here it is -. 

issue: no, unless your input weights are 0 for some reason (which shouldn't happen normally) paramTable()... look at 0_W specifically more generally: howexactlyare you determining that the output is always the same? 
solution: 

issue: is this before or after fitting your network? 
solution: 

issue: Hi! A few months ago I was trying to produce a jar to run the remote UI, never managed to get the jar running and found others online having the same problem when packaging the dl4j UI. Tried again today and still having the same errors. Do you have by chance the ready play UI I could run that accepts remote training? 
solution: AlexDBlack: no packaging jars is dead simple with intelliJ, but when adding the dl4j libraries then i always hi an error with the packaged jar, saying can't find main class. 

issue: AlexDBlack: nope it's not the precision problem. I checked one element in the output array and it's exactly same: [<-CODE->] I tested with 0.8.0 and 0.9.1. The results are same. ok, let me try to get it. Thanks in advance! AlexDBlack: I found some clue when I tried to get you the model and test code. When I generating some random testing data, the result of each run is different. But when I use the data in my database, the result is same. So it's some data issue and I will check it out further. 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: i had buy three books at 2017-04-28,   another two books have already received , but only for your book (Deep Learning: A Practitioner's Approach)  aws tell me i can get about 08-16,  but now it tell me i have to wait until 10-24,   make me crazy, 
solution: 

issue: hi I got this error java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.nd4j.linalg.activations.IActivation.backprop(Lorg/nd4j/linalg/api/ndarray/INDArray;Lorg/nd4j/linalg/api/ndarray/INDArray;)Lorg/apache/commons/math3/util/Pair;If I execute this example architecture https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples/blob/master/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/feedforward/mnist/MLPMnistTwoLayerExample.java in my own project 
solution: 

issue: Hi everybody. First of all thanks for fixing the output Vertex issue ( [<-ISSUE->] ) in 0.9.2-SNAPSHOT version. We are still working on the SSD import from Keras (v 1.2.2). We are facing some problem with the import of .hdf5 file: [<-LINK->] It's a huge error stack of course (no need to go through it), but at line 614 we have also a CUDA related error and we were wondering if they are two different error or it's actually related to the failed .hdf5 file import. Do you have any suggestions? Thanks a lot. P.S:@AlexDBlackwe are really looking forward to share our project with you guys, but we are still performing some reviews and will not be able to present you anything before at least another week. 
solution: 

issue: Is there a simple way to print or view some weights of the network (without using the UI - I can't make it work)? OK, got it with println(weightMatrices(net)), thank you 
solution: 

issue: hi@raver119.  I am trying to get deeplearning4j going in eclipse, and am having trouble with the error that "log cannot be resolved" that occurs in code you wrote. I know you probably didnt use eclipse, but do you have any idea how to resolve the error in eclipse?  (log is an undeclared variable) 
solution: that’s usually bad idea - dl4j is suited for maven, and to be built from maven. 

issue: I have an INDArray (1x5 vector) and I want to get the index with the highest value in it. Is there a nifty way to do this or do I just have to loop through it? Nd4j.argmax(arr, 1)? 
solution: I suppose that returns an INDArray with one element in it.. 

issue: When I import the dl4j-examples into IntelliJ (using the Maven project), I do not get source files for e.g. DataSet. Is this expected? 
solution: (I've set up my start-exploring project, using Gradle, and when I look up DataSet there, I do have the sources. Albeit complaining that the source and class files does not match, but that's evidently Lombok). you shouldn't be doing that or even trying to look at that or even care about that. 

issue: Hi! I've been running the same compGraph (12 layers, LSTMS & Dense) on my 2012 macbook (8GB ram) and on one of paperspace's 16 vCPU instance (60GB ram), the macbook iteration is about 8/10 times faster...and I'm running the exact same code, am I missing something? both use CPU backend Hum, in both case they are running with way enough memory the cloud instance has 30GB allocated for the java app 
solution: ironflood: I don't think this has anything to do with ram.. 

issue: firasdib: suggested having a look at the 12 layer comp graph perf on Paperspace 16 vCPU instance:PerformanceListener - iteration 11; iteration time: 104685 ms; samples/sec: 0.955; batches/sec: 0.010; score: 0.11634988150463205; DefaultOpExecutioner - Cores: [16]; Memory: [34.7GB]; On the old MacBook Pro with only 8Gb ram (4 cores): PerformanceListener - iteration 11; iteration time: 8877 ms; samples/sec: 11.265; batches/sec: 0.113; score: 0.11634988150463205; 11.8x faster ) 
solution: Yeah sometihng it wrong. The system suddently ate over 60gb of ram then crashed.. 

issue: ironflood: reduce number of cores you’re using by using OMP_NUM_THREADS env variable set it to 4 to start with, then increase to 6, then 8 etc and pick best one in practice, if you’re on aws, your best result is usually around 6 firasdib: point me to your iterator setup. 
solution: 

issue: What can I put in my build.sbt to use DL4J?  e.g.:libraryDependencies += "org.deeplearning4j" %% "deeplearning" % "0.9.0"? 
solution: 

issue: hi guys, I'm having some trouble with arbiter example, could you give me some information about it? more especificaly with the net configuration 
solution: yes, and I was able to run with the net configuration avaible there, but when I try to use the convolution layer an error show up. 

issue: saudet: Any progress on [<-ISSUE->] ? 
solution: 

issue: firasdib: That sounds great! What's the scores? (I am not familiar with the state of the art, do you have a link?) 
solution: I realized what I fucked up re. Dropout: Learning rate. Evidently, I had to lower the learning rate when using dropout, or else it explodes. Not familiar with that. (Also, doesn't get better with dropout..). 

issue: saudet: @agibsoncccThis relates to an issue I have trying to compile withsbtand cuda. I was advised the nd4s builds but it doesn't for me using 0.9.1 or  0.9.2-SNAPSHOT. [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: Is this not similar to what Alex did for the Adam updater? 
solution: As I understand it, referring to AlexDBlack\'s "2 options", it is the "second option" that most closely fits the dropout-paper\'s definition.. That\'s max-norm normalization technique sounds pretty .. "logical": Make the entire vector\'s "length" (l2-norm) be forced within a constraint. Compared to the l1 and l2, that would keep the relative sizes between the weights the same, while l1 and l2 individually adjusts the weights downwards - "decaying" them.. 

issue: agibsonccc: Does dl4j have any built in cross validation methods, or do I need to create that myself? They have listeners for epoch start/end@stolsvik raver119: Did you have time to look at my memory issue? 
solution: i’ll look at it later today. 

issue: firasdib: Try using [<-LINK->] and Evals. 
solution: 

issue: hi, i'm new. followed the instructions on site with eclipse and intellij but none worked. is there update issue going on? in eclipse, after git download and maven clean install, the project does not allow me to run any java. the src structure seems wrong the os is win10 can i post an image here? 
solution: stolsvik: I had that issue too. The docs say you need to set it to true. A bit unintuitive perhaps, but probably a good reason behind it.. 

issue: input size is static, or might vary over time? esp for lstm also, is there any reason you’re not using workspaces? 
solution: and must be wrong if you suggest it ). 

issue: agibsonccc: @saudet, I resolved this issue: [<-ISSUE->] plz check and let me know your thoughts! Thanks for all the guidance.. 
solution: 

issue: i import dl4j-example occurs maven lifecycle problems , is that normal? 
solution: 

issue: Hi Everyone... So I seem to be getting somewhere with my RNN, but it seems to oscillate quite a bit, anywhere from Accuracy = 0.39, F1 = 0.56  to Accuracy = 0.49, F1 = 0.60 to Accuracy = 0.48, F1 = 0.60 and then back to Accuracy = 0.39, F1 = 0.56 over a 40 epoch run Network configuration located here: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: I am not able to use dl4j uber jar with my maven project, since it contains servlet classes as well. Please suggest a work-around for it. on a webserver 
solution: 

issue: Hello, 0.9.1 is stable branch or it is development branch like 0.8.1-Snapshot? 
solution: I would like to ask where have been moved Pair from datavec?. haha. 

issue: it's not a huge priority for me at the moment (especially given FileStatsStorage is fixed re: those intermittent deadlock issues), but I do want to get to it 
solution: 

issue: raver119: do you remember my question / exception from saturday? It could be possible that its caused because of two different versions of netty. Spark is using 4.0.43.Final and neo4j is using 4.1.8 .. I wondered why this did not happened earlier and maybe you know what is executing this specific part of code .. 
solution: every other job is working fine .. only this treeAggregate don't work. 

issue: change your nn configuration and dataset labels. just reframe it to class 0 as True and class 1 as False and it’ll work for you probably bug. i remember such bug few versions ago. anyway, softmax has no sense with 1 element per tad 
solution: 

issue: Thanks! I am beginner with hadoop.  So  the process is to build the jar locally and the run it on the hadoop server? AlexDBlack: 
solution: 

issue: adityarar: you don't have a backend in that pom... you need either nd4j-native-platform or nd4j-cuda-8.0-platform to actually execute anything (on cpu or GPU respectively) 
solution: 

issue: Hi Guys, has anyone work on game AI? Could anyone please provide  me some instruction?It would be appreciated if you could. Thanks. :) 
solution: saudet: I know this is too broad question that too without context, but just wanted your opinion - in DQN (double DQN enabled) if we're getting only one action as output, what could be problem? I'm trying to debug and understand in depth, but your thoughts will help me very much... 

issue: I set:.layer(0, new VariationalAutoencoder.Builder().encoderLayerSizes(44,33,22,11).decoderLayerSizes(11,22,33,44)or .decoderLayerSizes(44,33,22,11)but it always shows decoderLaryerSizes are (44,33,22,11) in trainingUI. Is that OK?

issue: agibsonccc: difficult ... parameter averaging was not usable for us, so we don't save any logs but go straight to gradient sharing ... but maybe I can provide some numbers later on data dimensions, rough network architecture and amount of data and compare it with keras .. with ParameterAveragingTrainingMaster we ise IterationListener .. It seems that they dont work with GradientSharing. Is this possible or am I doing something wrong?

solution: 

issue: I have a rather theoretical Question if i can my Problem with Deeplearing4j solve* 
solution: 

issue: So..major thing here Remember that DL4j (just like any other deep learning framework) can do anything It's a low level piece of middleware that allows you to build algorithms and provides utilities for running deep learning applications So if you have a use case that's solvable by machine learning then yes dl4j and any other low level framework can do it Dl4j is not opencv opencv is your higher level api that allows you to think about "vision use cases" and "face detection" 
solution: 

issue: raver119:  [<-LINK->] That is the idea behind this change? For us it means we may not pack both deps (cuda and cpu) in the assembly anymore and fallback to cpu if cuda is not configured on the system does not work anymore.

issue: I have question about lombock in relation to implementing own Vertexes or Layers. This is kinda weird. I see some vertexes with lombock annotations and some without. Now, I used lombock annotations but the UI still throws exception because (I assume) despite lombock annotations I still have to statically add my new vertex class to some collections because (I assume) it is not auto-discovering.The question is, should lombock annotations be used at all? 
solution: I had this issue already when writing stochastic depth layer - solution was to introduce a default no-param constructoor.

Has anyone had same issue with dl4j 0.9.1? w00t, works! Is it (DataTypeUtil.set...) bugged only for GradientCheckUtil or in general? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: are you saying that in intellij, when you make a new  program, and you want to use the gpu, you can change that in the pom of the new program, even if the pom of the dependent projects (including nd4j ) is set to cpu, and it will use the gpu backend? - and you dont have to recompile the dependent projects? 
solution: 

issue: Thanks very much@agibsonccc. Initialising Nd4j solved it. And wow the perf difference between Float and Double is almost 1.5X due to SIMD optimization. Love your work! 
solution: 

issue: sorry, I was just trying to get your published example running, knowing it was using another already working program, with the intention to get it working on mine after I got it working.  thats how I write software.  my mistake was that I assumed that the imports were part of the dl4j package rather then part of the examples.

solution: 

issue: Is there example how to use LearningRateSchedule? I have several questions about that and I didnt found answers. And I should set policy or schedule but not both together? 
solution: papperwing: schedule is a special case of a policy... you need to set LearningRatePolicy.Schedule to use it. abravo84: not clear what you want to do... do you want to generate sentences (as in, text summarization)? or rank pairs of sentences by similarity?different architectures are typically used for those (no examples yet for either of those exactly though). 

issue: Are there any example of a simple summarization algorithm (sentence ranking) using dl4j? I have implemented my summ-tool using a liner regression algorithm and I would like test it on deeplearning. I have all features in csv/arff files. AlexDBlack: I am sorry, I want rank pairs of sentences by similarity. Now, I have a linear regression algorithm using  the cosine similarity. 
solution: For each sentence of a document, I have a vector representation. Then, I calculate the centroid value for each sentence and in addition, I include more features as position of the sentence, number of section....

issue: dmitryb-asg: ye, sorry, you’re right. that cosinedistance wasn’t announced properly so clustering can’t use it :( once i merge my current branch it will work though file an !issue please 
solution: 

issue: Just found a "bug". If you do:InputSplit[] filesInDirSplit = (new FileSplit(parentDir, allowedExtensions, randNumGen)).sample(pathFilter, 33, 33, 33);And then use that to initialize an ImageRecordReader, then ParentPathLabelGenerator goes nuts and creates incorrect labels. This happens if you have less than 1 example per folder than the number of splits, so in this case it only starts working after at least 3 examples on each folder. I was trying to test just 1 example per folder and spent hours going crazy about my 0% accuracy... It works for 1 example per folder if I do sample(pathFilter, 100); 
solution: 

issue: @agibsonccc: this is kinda crazy, but:1) does nd4j have an equiv for matplotlib ?2) how hard would it really be to write something that converts pytorch math exprs (not all python code) to nd4j calls ? there's so much tensorflow / pytorch sample code out there

issue: Hi guys, I am trying to train a model on a cluster. I checked your website and added kryo to the dependencies but am still having this error: [<-CODE->] I am using gradle. Any ideas on what can cause this? It is definitely present and downloaded correctly. AlexDBlack: Recreating a new cluster seems to have fixed it! :) I guess the dependencies were not completely installed for some reasons. 
solution: 

issue: well, the obvious one is that it's not being added to the classpath correctly - I'd check that it's actually present first(and if it's not: it's probably a gradle issue or how you are building your uber-jar) is this via spark submit? or run locally in your IDE?

issue: Additionally, calling the LocalFileModelSaver will also keep the model in memory? (i.e, that could be retrieved with trainer,getBestModel() ) AlexDBlack: So if I call trainer.getBestModel() where trainer has been created with LocalFileModelSaver, it is going to read it from the file (and not access it from memory)? 
solution: @AlexDBlackIt seems that getBestModel is reading from memory even if LocalFileModelSaver is set. I deleted the model while debugging and called getBestModel and I didn't see any errors.. 

issue: tripathysa: are you using eclipse IDE? Eclipse is notorious for caching old versions in its projects and not updating when you change versions in your build tool...the methods you are looking for are there in 0.9.1

issue: raver119: I've tried nIn(256). Now the exception is: [<-LINK->] raver119: The convolutional layers work. However, when I tried to add dense layer and add preprocessor to it, I've got an exceptionThe configuration is [<-LINK->] the exception is [<-LINK->]

issue: raver119: I just recently updated to 0.9.1 , here is an excerpt of my pom.xml : [<-LINK->] I actually had the feeling that it got worse after the update to the new version. raver119: ok, thanks, will try taht 
solution: 

issue: @AlexDBlack hi, i want use lstm to do text classification, but When I try to get the corresponding labe of data from the evaluation , the order of predict label I got is inconsistent with the actual data I entered , resulting that I can not get the true label of each data. for example, my input is:text LabelA    1B    1C    2D    2E    3F    3but when i try to get the predict label from evaluation, the order of label maybe like: 2 2 3 1 3 1,but what i want is 1 1 2 2 3 3,what can i do? i re-write the Evaluation to get predict label( [<-LINK->] ), but the order of label, is not same as my input i want to get the predict label of each test data, and output like (date label),but the evaluation only can get Accuracy/Precision/Recall/F1 Score, what should i do ? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: Hi, yes I am thinking about doing something like this: [<-LINK->] . If I am not mistaking, this numpy example extracts in a flatten array every True value of the mask. 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: , please help me to find what's wrong in my code. I save timeSeries data into files, but cannt work. thank you! My code: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Do you think it could be achieve through a multiplication through a boolean mask (INDArray.gt()), an INDArray.ravel() and a BooleanIndexing.replaceWhere (the later used to copy values that reflect the greaterThan 0 condition)? Is that because BooleanIndexing.replaceWhere doesn't actually change the final dimensions? Do you want me to open an Issue in nd4j? ok sure 
solution: 

issue: hello i have problems with matrix mis matched lengths due to the pooling layer but this doesn't seem to depend by the shape of the input that i give here it comes 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: I am looking the IrisAnalysis and BasicDataVecExample examples (in datavec examples), but I dont see how to convert CSV to INDArray . I have been testing the SingleTimeStepRegressionExample with my CSV file, but it is not working, I'm stuck... agibsonccc: I am using record readerSequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator(testReader, miniBatchSize, -1, 32, true);with regression value TRUE, like the SingleTimeStepRegressionExample, but I dont et any output fromnet.output(features, false); 
solution: 

issue: Accuracy is low or network isn't learning? Start by reading [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: this is the error that i get when using RnnOutputLayer Mismatched shapes (shape = [250, 17], row vector shape =[15000, 1]) 
solution: 

issue: so you have a time series out (i.e., time series labels), in other words? sighthen why are you using pooling over time? by definition pooling over time is how you go from a time series to not a time series wait, how can you get accuracies when you can't even run it? 
solution: 

issue: ashuezy: can you provide us with your corpus (or at least part of it) that reproduces this crash? 
solution: file an issue please, and put your stuff there. i’ll try to reproduce your issue locally, and if we’re lucky - i’ll fix it. 

issue: which version of cudnn is supported by 0.9.1 ? 
solution: i think.. ashuezy: if you’re restoring paravec from serialized model, you should set back tokenizer/preprocesor. 

issue:  [<-LINK->] but my question in gist 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: as commented before, I have adapted my input to the MultiTimeStepRegressionExample, but I get an error in the "net.fit(trainDataIter);" instruction.  [<-LINK->] 4rnoldHess: I am solving the same problem 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: i know im kinda frustrated... i changed it like we talked earlier but i still get those spooky errors. In the example they also use iter.next() but in if i try its no suchElementException. 
solution: agibsonccc: no my current error, my challenge to create a network based on regression. agibsonccc: i try to find a solution on my own i will post it here when im done. Chears guys thanks for any help :). 

issue: what do you mean on each character ? as i see your string is being split properly 17 0 0 ah nvm hm. i see. sorry :) 
solution: It is rather strange -- I'll try manually change the input file's delimiter to comma and see if it persists. 

issue: Hmm, I goofed something up:java.lang.IllegalStateException: Invalid configuration: cycle detected in graph. Cannot calculate topological ordering with graph cycle (cycle includes vertex "output") 
solution: 

issue: @raver119 I have tested by replacing the file delimiters with commas and semicolons - both seem to work properly, as expected. But when I change back to the | pipe delimiter, it does not work It's splitting on regex, try using '\\|' instead ^^^^^@mdebeer 
solution: 

issue: wmeddie: finished reading the !book.  It is genuinely good.  It'll give you a real solid understanding of all the words your need to make DL4J work. 
solution: 

issue: I see somebody raised a similar issue for Spark, [<-ISSUE->] , is it fixed or am I missing anything ? 
solution: In my case it runs in ParalleWrapper. anyway, check my comment in your issue.. 

issue: @OssamaAlshabrawyWill you file an !issue? I am not sure what the expectation is when you want to use tbptt But in anycase when you throw in a dense layer between those conv1d and rnn layers the number of timesteps between input and output will change. And that is the error you are seeing 
solution: 

issue: Are there ways to use the UI with a SparkEarlyStoppingTrainer?  [<-LINK->] doesn't seem to cover SparkEarlyStoppingTrainer It doesn't seem that there are any functions to access the SparkDl4jMultiLayer that is created inside 
solution: tripathysa: use -platform instead if you can. 

issue: OssamaAlshabrawy: mind opening an issue? I haven't actually tried TBPTT + 1d conv... I get the feeling that it should be possible under some - but not all - circumstances 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: @raver119: I am still not able to figure out the error..I changed it to CUDA platform and removed classifier..Here's my new gradle [<-LINK->] the same error: [<-LINK->] Somewhere I read that gcc version need to be >=4.8 as a fix for this but my version is already 4.8.4 Actually the code was working fine with 0.8.0 dl4j versions when i upgraded them to 0.9.1 it started occuring 
solution: 

issue: tripathysa: i can’t open your gradle, 404 error version `GOMP_4.0' not found just missing dep binary dep. 
solution: 

issue: tripathysa: one note here is that you've commented out the classifiers. although@saudetmade some changes to make the binaries better compatible with Gradle, it seems the-platformartifact still doesn't work consistently 
solution: 

issue: I am sorry, but I dont see the error, the input is well-read and the network works with the iris data, a input very similar. [<-LINK->] the net.output(features);  is returning an array of NaN 
solution: 

issue: How do you get a DataSetIterator with batches of n sequences from a DataSet? (the dataset may contain more sequences) the use case is I've saved a big bin file with a dataset (all sequences in the same file), and I'm loading it through ExistingMiniBatchDataSetIteratorI've done that this way to be able to split it into train and test data using different split percentages, and batch sizes, without having to recreate the data (ie, put it together. which is costly in my case) makes sense? if I save the data in different bin files (0.bin, 1.bin, 2.bin, etc) and I split it into train and test beforehand, I can't change those values (split and batch size) afterward not sure if there's a better way honestly 
solution: 

issue: up to 300kb ram? you’d better start thinking on asm. or, pure c if you’re lucky enough. but i’d go with asm, without trying luck... well, with asm you can manually move data etc so learning will be streamed, without single array in memory even once 
solution: 

issue: send some guys to the moon? that was enough some time ago 
solution: Right but then there's accuracy trade offs though. No Learning on that Chip!!. 

issue: Okay, so what you are telling me is: It does not matter what type of Classification-Algorithm I choose. The Hardware needs to be squeezed out with the most optimized programming-techniques to get it to run. Easier would be to choose better Hardware. Okay, so thank you again for your thoughts and time. I will consider it and decide on what to do next. Byebye 
solution: Wait a sec, if the normalizer is saved with the model, then the data is usually saved without normalization. I thought the common approach was to normalize and then presave :). 

issue: AlexDBlack: Hi, sorry quick question: has the Yolo2Outputlayer already been released inside 0.2.2-SNAPSHOT? 
solution: 

issue: it was merged to master maybe 12 hours ago, itshouldhave made it to snapshots by now but I haven't checked 
solution: 

issue: If I have a layer in a graph with multiple inputs, how are those inputs computed? Are they concatenated and ran through or one by one and the output concatenated? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Yes! Absolutely. I meant.addLayer("foo", ..., "input1", "input2, "input3"). So my MultiDataSet will beINDArray[]{x, y, z}. Will this layer then spit out 3 arrays as well, which I then need to merge or what? The reason for my confusion is I currently have a setup where a dense layer is receiving two inputs (which are outputs from 2 other layers) and it seems to work fine. I initially thought I needed to add a merge vertex before the dense layer but I'm not sure now  [<-LINK->] ah, that would explain why nothing seemed to happen 
solution: i would imagine it would only actually look at the first input and ignore subsequent ones. 

issue: .addLayer("baz", DenseLayer, "foo", "bar")works? That...doesn't sound right? Largely it should only take 1 input there it\'s just "x * w + b" where "x" is the input so I'm not sure that actually does anything 
solution: 

issue: crockpotveggies: @agibsoncccthey work well on release, but Gradle has issues with SNAPSHOT artifacts...@tripathysabut I don't think that's your issue, there's already an issue opened for that [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: crockpotveggies: I tried both of the configurations..Same error :) 
solution: 

issue: @AlexDBlackI filed an issue for using Convolution1DLayer with  tbptt@eralyReally thanks Susan for sharing your thoughts with me  [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: firasdib: message looks self-explanatory, something in your params prevented averaging or, you’ve used non-averaging training mode 
solution: to use stride(1) with  convolutionmode.Same, that  will prevent the downsampling of the timesteps. 

issue: Quick question, how do you get the number of iterations already trained for a model? I've noticed if you train a saved model, it doesn't start counting from 0 I'm getting this error: [<-LINK->] Is this a known bug on the last release? 
solution: That's a class of problems you run in to with java and sclaa. 

issue: raver119: thanks a lot, allowParallelTokenization(false) fixed the problem 
solution: 

issue: I'm trying to visualize my model in the UI, but its not showing up. I'm trying to visualize it before training, and I suppose I need to train for it to show up? 
solution: You can't it needs stats in order for it to see anything. 

issue: So I've managed to work my way through getting* a simple classifier training on top of Spark. Not actually getting as it runs for quite a bit and then out puts a bunch of NaNs for the evaluation. So I'm getting:of classes:    0Accuracy:        0.0000Which makes me think I'm definitely doing something wrong. Man, not very used to gitter 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I'm trying to run a classifier on a GPU machine. I've followed all the instructions at your website ( [<-LINK->] ), however, I get the following error (Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no jnind4jcuda in java.library.path) when I run it using a created a jarFile for the project. Any idea why it is happening? Your help is very appreciated. [<-LINK->] raver119: @firasdibThanks a lot for the prompt reply. The pom.xml: [<-LINK->] 
solution:

solution: 

issue: hey guys my name is waterkid and i need help with outputs in java 
solution: 

issue: Hadi-H: did you confirm your cuda install works? right but did you actually confirm your cuda install works? CUDA_HOME being set doesn't mean you ran actual cuda code included with the distribution 
solution: 

issue: I Have in network transition from one layer with 4096 into 7 which is leading me into problem with weight init mentioned in Detecting poor WeightInit in book. Could adding more layers help to solve this problem? Or do I solve it by trying some multiplication of xavier? 4096 is relu and 7 is sigmoid And I am changing init for 7. 4096 is part of Alexnet.java Yeah but this problem is in all layers. All of them has same graph.  [<-LINK->] So I dont know if it is problem of initialization or something other. 
solution: 

issue: Hi everybody, I am sorry to bother you, but I cannot see your YOLO2OutputLayer inside the last build... I think I am missing something.. 
solution: right, and bad weight init shouldn't be so extreme to cause it to happen immediately. 

issue: I am getting NaN  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: What do i train it with ? That is my question.. dictionary or what ? 
solution: they expect you have vectors to compare. 

issue: when i run the demo Word2VecSentimentRNN by Alex Black, i have a question: how can i known  probabilitiesAtLastWord.getDouble(0) is positive, and getDouble(1) is negative? or where can i change getDouble(0) to negative  [<-LINK->] 
solution: it\'s "set" beforehand. 

issue: right, string labels are only for humans for convenience not used by the net DataSetIterator maps each class to an index in the array I don't have time to properly reply now - but 2 thingsfirst: I'd use this method to do the pretraining [<-LINK->] second: you have an output layer in the middle of your net - you can't do that 
solution: 

issue: then i want to do multi-classification, but i don't known the input data, what should i do to get the predicted lable ? like [0.3, 0.4, 0.3] for[basketball, football, badminton] ,i get the predict label is football 
solution: 

issue: Hi@AlexDBlack, a while ago i posted a follow-up question to [<-ISSUE->] . And created another issue related to it ( [<-ISSUE->] ). You told me I could bug you on Gitter to have a look at it, so here I am :-) I Would be very grateful if you could give me your opinion on both of them, thanks in advance! Ok thanks for the pointer! AlexDBlack: do you mind if I ask you again in the future about [<-ISSUE->] ? It's something that I can't seem to figure out.. 
solution: 

issue: papperwing: what loss function for the output layer? yeah, you want sigmoid there to constrain output to 0-1 range values outside of that (like, due to relu) could cause NaNs 
solution: 

issue: hey guys, I have the following issue: after some time of Training I get  Training score: NaN. I tried to Google, checked the older issues, but they didnt really help me. I Train a Network on spark, no gpus and the learning rate is decaying over time, so it's not too big for sure. do you have any idea what it might be? 
solution: 

issue: Hey all, I have a question on DataSetIterator of you could please help me int trainbatchSize = 5000;       int testBatchSize=1000;        int numOfBatches=10;        DataSetIterator iterator = new RecordReaderDataSetIterator(recordReader,trainbatchSize,labelIndex,numClasses,numOfBatches);        DataSetIterator iterator1 = new RecordReaderDataSetIterator(recordReader1,testBatchSize,labelIndex,numClasses,numOfBatches);        DataSet trainingData = iterator.next(); [<-CODE->] I have these lines of code. My question is on numOfBathces. If i use net.fit(iterator) it will load all my data from my training file (specified in recordReader) in 10 batches? net.fit(trainingData)* correction raver119: the javadoc says yes but it seems that this does not happen because the iterations finish quiker if i use numOfBatches>1 Is this normal? 
solution: 

issue: hey guys, I had an issue with Training score being NaN even though I used the Parameters pretty much with Default values. Now I upgraded to dl4j 0.9.1 and now I have the issue that SparkDl4jMultiLayer.evaluate() shows NaN (from the very beginning). the old issue is here: [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: I'm pretty sure the evaluate NaN issue is due to the known issue listed here: [<-LINK->]

issue: Hey, im a student from Germany. I wonna use Deeplearning4j to create a compression program. The Programm should be the base of my A-level exams net year. Can someone help me a bit with that? 
solution: Wilwilly: per-outputmasking is supportedper-inputmasking doesn't really make sense (no use case for it - just set 0s. Comparatibley, per time step feature masking does have a use case - global pooling and the like). I think everything is already built in dl4j. We just need UpSampling Layer where the deconvolution is (Convolution layer + Upsampling layer). Likewise the Upsampling1D will be repeating the timesteps for "stride size" times. 

issue: AlexDBlack: I know you're all busy. But I've been waiting online for 5 days, so please take some time to help me with the issue: [<-ISSUE->] thank you very much.

issue: Have you guys seen anything where aws p3 instance GPU isn't recognized? I've already tried adding dependencies for 7.5 and 8 to no avail. I'm using the AWS Ubuntu deep learning image and I'm wondering if I should manually install CUDA drivers as they may have configured them in a non-standard way. Also my question is specific to deeplearning4j-- I'm getting the unable to find CUDA device error and I've already tried the applicable suggestions from past issues. I'm currently reinstalling CUDA to see if that helps. 
solution: Some of the issues said disable the nd4j-native dependency when using CUDA. Is that still required/best practice to avoid conflicts? I mainly ask, because I don't see offheap RAM allocated..

issue: agibsonccc: , I know you told me 0.7.1 is no longer supported. I switched to the latests release (0.9.1), but this is crashing on me because ND4J_FALLBACK is not working (cf issue I made for this [<-ISSUE->] ).So I'm wondering: what is the newest version that is known NOT to have any issues with libopenblas crashing?I'm trying to get the listeners (e.g. ScoreIterationListener) to work with SparkDl4jMultiLayer, but they're never logging anything in 0.7.1. Either I misconfigured sth or 0.7.1 has listener issues.. If the latter is true, is this a known issue that  might've been fixed post 0.7.1? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: what i meant is: When I use such a try(Workspace ws = .....){some NDArray-creation }-block, could i also do try(Workspace ws = .....){some NDArray-creation-and-then-put-it-into-DataSets }-block? 
solution: you can ask@firasdib, he tried to do that, and had overwrites.

issue: RL4J question: The only available learning methods seem to be ones that train (state,action)-value functions, like Q-learning. However, straight-forward TD learning can also learn (state)-value functions if you have a perfect model of what state each action leads to. AlphaGo took advantage of being able to model Go, and many other domains (board games especially) allow this kind of forward modelling. If I want to use DL4J/RL4J in a domain that has a perfect forward model, where should I start? Should I extend org.deeplearning4j.rl4j.learning.Learning, or do I need to go further up the chain and customize further? Basically, I'm not clear to what extent all of the RL4J code depends on the assumption of learning a (state,action)-value functions, and wonder if any of the RL4J code will actually be helpful. If not, then I'm sure there is a way to make progress based off of the core DL4J code, but that would be a lot more work.

Should I extend org.deeplearning4j.rl4j.learning.Learning, or do I need to go further up the chain and customize further? Basically, I'm not clear to what extent all of the RL4J code depends on the assumption of learning a (state,action)-value functions, and wonder if any of the RL4J code will actually be helpful. If not, then I'm sure there is a way to make progress based off of the core DL4J code, but that would be a lot more work.. 

issue: I have a general question: I see that the conv layer implementation by itself already  pools on its input depth. I assume it averages over the three channels? But that would mean, that the conv layer essentially discards any color information the input image. I strongly assume I'm wrong or missing out on sth. Here's what I did: to see intermediate activations I call the activation ( input, false) on a conv layer. With depth_in being 3, depth_out being 10, layer.activation(...) returns 10 feature maps. Background: I'm chasing vanishing gradients at subsequent RELU layer. Any help is highly appreciated

issue: Once you have the iterator? To split into two other iterators? Not really. You want to do the split usually before you get to the iterator 
solution: 

issue: schrum2: "actor critic" methods as implemented in rl4j actually learn the value of each state, so it doesn\'t sound like it would require a lot of modification to support that specialization Yi-Coder: so it's an issue with your device, read this: [<-LINK->]

issue: Hi guys, any tips on loading a model from s3? I can't find a way to import a model to hdfs This is what I thought but I am getting this error when I pass the s3objectinputstream  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: so I don't get any error but the file is not being written to s3 isn;t it already done in writeModel here [<-LINK->] ? 
solution: I mean it coul dbe anything including something as simple as you not having permissions setup right. agibsonccc: You were right. flush/close was indeed needed. writeModel was flush/closing a separate stream but not the stream that was passed to it.

issue: Hi guys, the config below dies with out of memory exception on my 12Gb Titan X within minutes: [<-LINK->] I am kinda very surprized especially since I tuned minibatch size down to 1(!) and the error still there 
solution: I am running nvidia-smi in parallel and yes memory consumption in gpu rise to about 5GB remain constantly and after couple of iterations just spike to over 12GB. 

issue: Is it possible to grab a view of specific rows of a large matrix? Right, but I want to utilize the multi-threaded capabilities. When I do a loop of getRow I'm executing that single thread and I believe thats why my code is slow. 
solution: 

issue: on current master you can declare custom op in c++ pretty easily 
solution: you can't get a view over arbitrary rows, as the math (strides) don't work. you call pull arbitrary rows (non-view). or one row at a time. 

issue: AlexDBlack: just file an !issue

issue: Hello guys, im back with a new Problem. Im finaly got my data in place and my net gets trained in a regression type neurol network. I also linked a DL4j Trainings UI to see the Model Score vs Iterations. I want to evaluate my data in every epoch know, same like in the regression/SingleTimestepRegressionExample.java example.If i know split my test data into features and labels and evaluate it like in the example from d4lj i get this error message:Invalid data: expect rank 3 arrays. Got arrays with shapes labels=[9, 1], predictions=[9, 1] it seems like i didnt understand how it got splitted or why are there 3 arrays expected? I appricate any help. Thanks guys :) abravo84:  [<-LINK->] in line 100 they do the training and evaluating per epoch. 
solution: 

issue: raver119: I found the error - as expected it was horrendous and stupid bug in MY iterator that was wrinting all the data only in the first position of timeseries of feature/label and masks. Only scary thing is that this noob error was able to fill up 12GiB of GPU ram o_O 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: issue filed [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: fahman: enjoy.. :). 

issue: sricholkar: Welcome! Here's a link to Deeplearning4j's Gitter Guidelines, our documentation and other DeepLearning resources online. Please explore these and enjoy! [<-LINK->] Sorry, i'm just simple bot, and can't get you 
solution: 

issue: My LossFunction in my program is MSE and I have score (calculated form ScoreIterationListener) of 540 at first epoch and reduced to 60 at the end of 100th epoch. Could anyone interpret this? My timeseries data is normalized in the feature range (0, 1) vimalaguti: Oh is it, thanks. I have not found that anywhere in the documentation . Could you just link me to it? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: one last question, do I need to change my code if I feed a corpus having one article per line(and not one sentence per line)? 
solution: 

issue: Anyone available to help me?, never used Maven before, anyone have a basic / example pom.xml file with the core features I could use? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: the spark submit has as arguments:11 executorsmemory executor of 19G5 cores per executor(the spark submit is ran behind some functions that I can't share here but these are the arguments that are passed) (and my cluster had 1 master node, 1 core node, 4 task nodes each m4.4xlarge) raver119: I tried to re-run it on a smaller cluster and it seems to used all the nodes and is running on many executors this time. I am not sure what happened. 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] This is pretty strange, isn't it? I'm getting really high scores at the 3d-4th epoch, and the activations of layer 3 is going crazy 
solution: check activations vs time, mean parameters vs time. 

issue: I closed my avoidable issue 4013. Sry for that, guys and thanks for the help. seems to work now, memory is freed regularly, dont think it will crash anymore. Running on a VM now also. 
solution: 

issue: just curious... shouldnt the entropy-calculations for INDArrays that raver119 made be included in the 0.9.1. version for nd4j!? 
solution: Wilwilly: right, that would explain it. 

issue: Hi guys, is there a way to get the index of a column by name? I\'ve created a DataSchema, then use a TransformProcess to convert my "categoricals" into one-hot, so whenever I add a new category the index of my features changes I see that .getColumnNames() is deprecated, and just seems to return a blank list And I can't seem to find a getter to grab the TransformProcess out of the iterator (then I could use the 'final schema' to lookup the columns) Any suggestions? 
solution: 

issue: ajohnsonz: what iterator are you using? 
solution: agibsonccc: Yes true, in a different part of my application - but I guess I could pass it around. I was hoping that since the transform process is embedded in the Iterator that there would be an easy way to get to it. 

issue: I have maybe stupid question but is it possible to set for UI starting iteration? :D That I maybe started to collect information from 20k iteration instead 0? :D 
solution: It seems weird that if I continue in training it starts to get me information that on iteration 0 it has some score :D. 

issue: yeah, it's fine. Just if the docs aren't clear on this - maybe open an !issue with suggestions for improvementsdocs are scalable, answering too many questions isn't :) vimalaguti: also maybe garbage collection? !workspaces 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: I recall when profiling earlier,getIntandgetDoublewere quite heavy operations. 
solution: I need to pull each individual value from a 2d matrix (row by row), do some math, and put it back.. 

issue: I never find what I want in the documentation... If I go tohttp://nd4j.org/index.html-- how do I find workspace documentation? raver119: thanks, but its hard to navigate and find anything on the site Not the javadoc, your nd4j site I think adam is already on it, sorry to bring it up again If I use the adam optimizer on my problem, it converges. If I use nesterovs/momentum, it does not. Regular SGD seems to work. Why is this so? 
solution: 

issue: Dathiou: I'd recommend using [<-LINK->] instead of the parameter average training masterand yes, if your test set is huge, then it'll take a long time to calculate - it does a full pass on the entire test data setrddDataSetNumExamples = 1 for that case "spark UI" - do you mean spark\'s built-in UI? or DL4J\'s UI when running on spark?former yes; latter - you should be able to set the listeners on the training master 
solution: I am getting " org.deeplearning4j.exception.DL4JInvalidConfigException: Can\'t get Spark Master local address. Please specify it manually using VoidConfiguration.setControllerAddress(String) method or VoidConfiguration.setNetworkMask(String) method" but am not sure what kind of address is expected. 

issue: Trying to run DL4J Convnet on multiple GPUs. In your ivy-0.9.1.xml for nd4j-cuda-8.0 you refer to a variable ${dependency.platform} which I can resolve with -Ddependency.platform=... when using sbt on the shell. However, the only way to actually use the code, e.g. class CudaEnvironment in the IDE is to change the ivy xml (which is unforgivable in production, of course). This reference to ${dependency.platform} has only be introduced with version 0.9.1. The former version 0.7.2 uses a different approach and that works well. B.t.w - your hotline has a problem report from a guy called Evan Thomas with exactly the same problem. Could you pls advise? you refer to [<-LINK->] as "not being a general hotline", that\'s why 
solution: 

issue: I am having difficulty on setting up the SharedTrainingMaster on an aws cluster. is there anything else that need to be set except .unicastPort(40123)? a network mask is mentioned in the page but I am not sure what it refers to I get "User class threw exception: org.deeplearning4j.exception.DL4JInvalidConfigException: Can\'t get Spark Master local address. Please specify it manually using VoidConfiguration.setControllerAddress(String) method or VoidConfiguration.setNetworkMask(String) method" while running on the cluster

issue: Hi guys, seems like there are troubles with the CUDA-7.5 backend on Mac. I\'m running OS X 10.10 with a successfully installed CUDA 7.5 SDK and I get the "No CUDA devices were found in system" from ND4J. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 670 2048 MB 
solution: 

issue: To use gist: paste your code/exception/large output log into [<-LINK->] , click 'Create Secret Gist' and paste URL link here 
solution: so, in other words, cuda drivers think that you don’t have cuda-compatible gpu.. 

issue: Wilwilly: thx for clearing that up. BTW: I understood your initial question not as a reply but coincidentally, it fixed all my problems :-D Hm, from that comment, does regression actually use the single output column? Or will it simply use the next row? 
solution: regression would use the inputs (one column in your csv), to get a predicted value for the output (the other column in your csv). 

issue: raver119: "Unable to find network interface matching requested mask: 100.104.0.0/24"  [<-CODE->] not sure why it is checking for 100.104.0.0/24 when I put 100.104.0.0/16 It is actually due to this: [<-CODE->] /8 will be changed to /24 automatically right? 
solution: neither first or second. 

issue: raver119: Is it the case that a MultiDataSetIterator can't be saved into disk and loaded by ExistingMiniBatchDataSetIterator? :( Not sure how to persist it for later use 
solution: It is loaded, but then when I do dsiterator.next() I'm getting an empty dataset. 

issue: I've seenuse_locking = Truein optimizer config in TF code. Is this only relevant for multi thread? Sorry, my question was whether this was something I needed to worry about in dl4j. 
solution: raver119: Would it be possible to implement something like this? [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Hey guys, yesterday I\'ve reported an issue with CUDA-7.5 on Mac. I was getting "No CUDA devices were found in system" from ND4J 0.9.1. Today I\'ve tried running with ND4J 0.4.0 and it works. So the issue must be somewhere in ND4J and there must be a bug committed somewhere in between the mentioned releases. I\'ve filed a ticket on the tracker ( [<-ISSUE->] ). I understand. My point now is though that the issue must be somewhere in ND4J, since its older versions work fine under the same conditions. Alright. I guess I'll have to upgrade the OS 
solution: 

issue: Accuracy is low or network isn't learning? Start by reading [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->] 
solution: thx. 

issue: Looks like the VRAM\'s memory consumption is linearly correlated with the "batch size"It would appears that the DL4j loads all the samples into the VRAM? 
solution: Usually when people come up with "random bug for some reason" you\'re doing something off. 

issue: Hi! I am installing Dl4J on Windows with CPUBackend. When staring I get message in log: [Reflections] given scan urls are empty. set urls in the configuration. Then I get error java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError... Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerExceptionat org.nd4j.linalg.factory.Nd4j.initWithBackend(Nd4j.java:6278) I've got ND4J with: mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-dependency-plugin:2.1:get -DrepoUrl= [<-LINK->] -Dartifact=org.nd4j:nd4j-native-platform:0.9.1 Sorry I'm new in Maven... 
solution: 

issue: It shouldnt scale to 0-1 though? 
solution: 

issue: There is a LR schedule that only changes once the score stops improving. Are there any more details on this mechanic? When is the condition for non-improving reached? Is it between each iteration? Epoch? Whats the smallest value the LR can be? Would really appreciate some info here, or perhaps a link to the code where this happens AlexDBlack:  [<-ISSUE->] - in the mean time, is it possible for me to add a basic implementation of this manually? For now, something as simple as if the score has not improved by the end of the epoch, drop LR, would be sufficient My only concern is how to figure out if the score has not improved. I already have the custom mechanic for lowering LR at the end of epoch 
solution: AlexDBlack: At the end of each epoch, run a eval on test set and then if the F1 is lower than previous, reduce LR. Then store the new score etc. 

issue: AlexDBlack: I am stuck with creating a growing INDArray that gets an additional row/column/entry inside a loop...Played around with put() and putRow()/putColumn() but it always seems to overwrite just the last column...the idea was to go like this: [<-CODE->] so an INDArray cant get additional columns/rows then? 
solution: 

issue: Can/Do RNN work with continuouslearning? i.e. I'd like to stuff data in continuously and want to predict AND learn 
solution: 

issue: Would it help to normalize not to 1 but 0.5, if you assume that the data in future will ~ double? When would you not choose label normalization? 
solution: makes sense. 

issue: I have some funny behavior here. I created DataSetIterator and normalized data with ImagePreProcessingScaler(-1,1) then I presaved data and retrieved them with something like ExistingMiniBatchDataSetIterator (Bit edited for sake of shuffling). Then I set same preprocessor there. And somehow it normalized all data between -1 and -0.9999. 
solution: agibsonccc: I think it gives you back a scalar, but it's zero.. Should I open an issue? Maybe just to have this enhacement: the linspace should give you back the only point of the interval.... 

issue: papperwing: no, originally it expects 0 to 255 so if you apply it multiple times, bad things happen :) 
solution: yup, I know :). I have experienced that during iterations score is around 8 and once in the time it goes to 100. 

issue: Guys any thoughts as to why adding the followingtransformProcessBuilder = transformProcessBuilder.filter(new ConditionFilter(new DoubleColumnCondition("ZYISP", ConditionOp.GreaterOrEqual, 150.0)));would cause a NullPointerException atRecordReaderMultiDataSetIterator.convertWritables? Does the convertWritables take the size of the list of entries before the filter is applied or something? Surely that would never work in that case? 
solution: 

issue: that chart is not inherently bad right? I'm using tbptt 
solution: 

issue: raver119: which part did you change for the netmask? it seems that the snapshot has been updated but the code doesn't seem to have changed. there are still the same checks performed: [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: What does it mean when in first iteration score goes rapidly up then it lowers again? Show here your pom.xml as !gist it sometimes happen when you have there both dependencies Oh then dont mix version and just use 0.9.1 If you can 
solution: 

issue: 0.9.2-snapshot is broken stick with 0.9.1 
solution: 

issue: I think I have some major misunderstanding regarding normalization of labels. I have traindata with features (before normalization) ranging from -2..+2 and labels from -1..+1. I have fitLabel(true) and after normalization both features and labels are in the range 0..+1. Shouldn't the labels be -0.5..+0.5? schrum2: and the array is not null? Here's the debug output of my normalization question: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: show your sbt conf using !gist please just show us full sbt conf, like i’ve asked few minutes ago as gist 
solution: <script src="https://gist.github.com/smilebuddy/ca052b42cde1253eebef0c69ecc39825.js"></script>. looks legit. 

issue: Hi, do you have an example of CSV lines SequenceRecordReader for time series that doesn't have a fix length? The CSVSequenceRecordReader example does not work for me as I have to create 1 file per sequence. An example would be great. Otherwise, any help is very appreciated. 
solution: 

issue: Can a ComputationalGraph be used for multiple input recurrent regression with multiple outputs? (A recurrent MultilayerNetwork can't, right?) 
solution:  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->]. DL4J book (Deep Learning: A Practitioner's Approach) now available at [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Anybody here have done image classification project with deeplearning in spark? yes. even dog vs cat project will work :-) but that should be in spark cluster. 
solution: and mlp mnist nn even available as example.  [<-LINK->]. so i bet alex had enough fun there as well :). 

issue: I tried Zoo model with reference to this [<-LINK->] I don't know how to get classification for my data? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] What I did wrongly?  [<-LINK->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: either corrupt, is an existing directory, or simply isn't produced by FileStatsStorage in the first place. 

issue: what happens if you run with only gpu backend included? 
solution: I will not be able to create it because on local machine I dont have gpu and cuda :D on server I have it:D. 

issue: Hello guys, im currently working on my neuronal net and its going really well i kinda have problems with extracting the features / labels and the predicted value from the net out of the evaluation file. It seems those numbers are kinda buggy here is a gist [<-LINK->] I think my main problem is the normalisation or the revert function. I kinda think it breaks it due to the values i get. it seems the output of the MultiLayerNetwork.output(features, false) always get the predicted value as 1 if the features are normalized. Is this normal that the outcome is always 1? Or is there a other Error? hm.@ajohnsonzmaybe you are right. I just read in the documentary [<-LINK->] "neuronal network work best..." and due to the fact that im new to it was going with the best practice... 
solution: 

issue: Is there any example on multivariate time series prediction using LSTM like this [<-LINK->] by Jason Brownlee? 
solution: 

issue: Jeah i did@sricholkar. The Problem is i have a really small database but a high difficulty with 26 features. I guess its to much for the system. 
solution: ajohnsonz: yes that's true, the actual values in this case is labels. So the error in loss function depends on features and labels. If the labels aren't normalized, the value of error will be very high at each iteration. I think it's memory consuming.. 

issue: Hello, I have issues getting dl4j/nd4j 0.9.1 to run on CUDA on Windows 10. Is anyone around who could lend me a hand? (Note: I have installed NVidia's CUDA and read the dl4j/nd4j docs on the topic; I still get the dreaded Caused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: C:\\Users...\\windows-x86_64\\jnicuda.dll: Can't find dependent libraries ) Thanks! raver119: Thanks for helping! My CUDA version is 8.0 The full exception is here: [<-LINK->] Dammit, that might not have been a secret gist - sorry 
solution: 

issue: in [<-CODE->] what does "Starting training of split 1 of 1" mean? what is a "split"? is it supposed to be 1 split per worker? or each split will be partitioned among workers? 
solution: 

issue: Hello @raver119, has this issue received any more attention?deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j#3063Like the original poster, I would also like to incrementally train a paravec model starting with a previously trained word2vec model (trained using a large corpus, like the GoogleNews vectors), and augmenting with my own problem-specific corpus. I see from the last comments on github, that the op was unable to make this work. Thanks for any feedback/updates on this issue. 
solution: 

issue: when using the UI when the code runs on a cluster the UI_MACHINE_IP should the the public IP address of the machine where the UI instance runs? In spark, when passing the data to my local ui, the  UI_MACHINE_IP is the IP I find by typing ifconfig in my local? Thank you. Since the UI is running on my local, I thought the address would be the one of my local right? 
solution: Also@AlexDBlacksince you are here, I am reposting one of my questions above.For ParameterAveragingTrainingMaster, what is the difference between the two scenarios:batchSizePerWorker = 1000 ; averagingFrequency=1batchSizePerWorker = 200 ; averagingFrequency=5?. 

issue: AlexDBlack: : Hi, I am getting this issue while using CSVRecordReader Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: java.io.IOException: Un-terminated quoted field at end of CSV line from past few days, earlier it used to work fine for same data. Here\'s my piece of code [<-LINK->] It cannot read the next line. Full error: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: tripathysa: well, did you check the actual data?I'd put a breakpoint in at that parseLine method (that is throwing the exception) and actually look at the data I'm not following. as in you always get 0.51/0.49 regardless of the input? 
solution: kou998: if you change the dataset, you might need to change the tuning (learning rate, number of training epochs etc) toohard to debug that problem based on the informatio you have provided. 

issue: smilebuddy: it’s pretty much described at out !spark pages basically: build uber jar, and spark-submit then. not a rocket science 
solution: 

issue: Is it normal for my R2 regression evaluation to go down? According to [<-LINK->] it should go down, but mine stays around 0,01. I'm doing regression using RNN and ADAMS 
solution: No, but it could simply be a poorly tuned net - see !tuning. 

issue: Guys, i am getting this error "Exception in thread "main" java.net.ConnectException: Connection timed out (Connection timed out)" while running my jar which tries to download the MNIST dataset. I know there is a firewall. But i dont know how to set java_options in centos(linux) 
solution: ohhk i thought someone would have faced the problem.. 

issue: AlexDBlack: is there a cheat sheet anywhere for what each of the built-in Activation functions would "typically" be used for? Or is it a case of trial and error for each network? sirolf2009: yeah was looking at that, pretty neat page, but the missing step for me is another column in that table that breaks it down between regression, classification, MLP / RNN / CNN, etc AlexDBlack: ok am I right in thinking that a good starting point isregression: identity + MSEclassification: softmax + MCXENT ? And for the hidden layers, RELU ? (or, RELU for classification, and TANH for regression?) 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: awesome, thanks - and as a starting point, weight initialization Xavier for both, and updater Nesterovs? 
solution: sricholkar: honestly - that's not a good example (it was a community contribution). ajohnsonz: my usual config for convolutional and dense layers is leaky relu + RELU initadam updater for all layers.

solution: 

issue: Guys if I'm training a feedforward regression net, with 2 leakyrelu dense layers and a Identity+MSE output node, is there an obvious reason why if I use the ADAM updater I see my score updating at every iteration, but if use Nesterov updater the model score is just constant 0? I think I read somewhere that it was 10 ^ -3 Yeah "The most important use of this ratio is in selecting a learning rate. As a rule of thumb: this ratio should be around 1:1000 = 0.001.

issue: Question on model loading: I use LocalFileGraphSaver#getBestModel to load previously saved model. So when I save it, the score is 0.008 (same score dl4j is showing me after I reload for iteration 0). After first epoch score jumps to 0.02 and model never reaches the "initial score" (0.008) although I reload it with much more conservative hyperparams. (same result btw if I do not change hyperparams)So my question is - what could be the cause? Oh, I am not setting fixed random seed! 
solution: 

issue: DataSetIterator iterator1 = new RecordReaderDataSetIterator(recordReader1,testBatchSize,labelIndex,numClasses,numOfBatches);DataSet trainingData = iterator.next() Then i apply normalization to trainingData Does this apply normalization to all data or just the next record that i god using iterator.next() ??? got* DataNormalization normalizer = new NormalizerStandardize();normalizer.fit(trainingData);           //Collect the statistics (mean/stdev) from the training data. This does not modify the input datanormalizer.transform(trainingData);     //Apply normalization to the training data Does these lines do the job ? 
solution: then you either call a set pre processor or use transform on the minibatch. 

issue: wait shouldnt i normalize the data before .fit? 
solution: you need to call fit on the normalizer to compute the stats for the dataset. this line. 

issue: When you have timeseries data, and from value t_k you want to predict the next value t_k+1, why do you need to specify the value explicitly? Can't you tell the iterator to take it from the input? 
solution: lilalinux: that by definition doesn't make any sense for training. 

issue: agibsonccc: Can't I simply have a one column CSV with temperatures sampled at a fixed interval and use the next row as the label of the current row? hm, I could simply read the same file twice and skip some lines 
solution: 

issue: hi@agibsonccchow can i get to know the basic defination of all basic parameters used in ur coding examples like learning rate,epochs,nin etc? agibsonccc: thanks alot Nin is not there@agibsonccc 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: sorry sir can you please help me how to get started? i am new to it i have to implement this in my java project for power plant predicitons 
solution: If you're thinking at that level, you can email us for a commercial engagement with skymind academy [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Hi, I have a problem that I can't seem to figure outI'm using the ComputationGraph API to attempt to make a generative adversarial modelIn my configuration, I have [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Is there some way to fix this? Or am I going about this wrong? It seems you can only specify a loss function for an output layer, but output layers are ignored inComputationGraph.computeGradientAndScore()when it invokesfeedForward(true, true) damn :/I was hoping I could atleast still use dl4j even if I had to make custom/hacky things to make it work ya I'm trying to play around with them as well :p 
solution: 

issue: so my test produced equally poor results which means im no closer to finding out why 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: I know that example, but even there I didn't find info on that column. The original example has the format: X        Y112        118 but in dl4j the 2nd column is floating values. But it's not as simple as being the change to the next row

solution: 

issue: "In this paper, we introduce TextRank – a graph-based ranking model for text processing, and show how this model can be successfully used in natural language applications. In particular, we propose two innovative unsupervised methods for keyword and sentence extraction, and show that the results obtained compare favorably with previously published results on established benchmarks." this is my input.txt file 
solution: and you’ll see - not a single word has freq higher then 5. 

issue: I have been able to build successfully on windows for 0.9.2-SNAPSHOT using  nd4j-native instead the -platform artifacts.  However, I cannot build successfully on linux.I looked on the snapshot repository at https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/nd4j/nd4j-native/0.9.2-SNAPSHOT/ and could only find windows artifacts.  Is this expected? ok, so I am not crazy.  thx for the info 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack:  [<-ISSUE->] Would you like to review my pull request? It's really short. It adds multiple output regression support to SequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator It uses the currently ignored (for regression) labelIndex to divide the columns into the ones on the left side for inputs and the right side for outputs (IF labelIndex >1) for regression

solution: gkamita: looks like centos 7 doesn't have it: [<-LINK->]. this is for fedora though. 

issue: eduardodbr: please read that memory page adam posted there’s a reason we wrote it 
solution: 

issue: thanks for the advice. I read about dl4j and was trying to run some algos to see their behavior. To be honest i thought it would be something like mllib thats why i just incremented my ram just to see if it would work. Mybad for not reading all of your guides 
solution: FWIW there's a reason there's a ton of competition for machine learning on spark.

solution: 

issue: hello, should the resolution of my dataset images be a specific resolution? 
solution: aldrin233: no we handle that, it's mainly relative to your neural net architecture. 

issue: niteofhunter: .  Can you please re-phrase your question?  I cannot figure out how to help you. This bit? What explanation do you need? [<-CODE->] All of the really hard work in the mninst example is hiden away in the MnistDataSetIterator class. I think it is 99.5% of the work. But once you do get your data sorted out like the MnistDataSetIterator, the rest of the work really is not much more than you see in the example. 
solution: 

issue: then I need to change version to 0.9.2 in my dependecies? 
solution: [WARNING] Rule 1: org.apache.maven.plugins.enforcer.RequireFilesExist failed with message:!!! You have to compile libnd4j with cpu support first!Some required files are missing:D:\\temp\\nd4j\\nd4j-backends\\nd4j-backend-impls\\nd4j-native........\\libnd4j\\blasbuild\\cpu\\blas. 

issue: rangwank: I think you could mess with our image pipeline tools which use opencv internally You should be able to manipulate everything like that and just save the resulting patches as ndarrays directly SidneyLann: typically you would want to use YOLO for end to end multi object recognition doing everything at once Tum4ik: I answered your question on stack overlow overflow You can't auto fix a bad laptop :D sorry Your gpu is useless and an i5 has almost no power You can work on toy problems but whatever you do will take a long time 
solution: 

issue: I can't really find anyone who has experimented much with this. Or my google-fu is weak. 
solution: there we go, I was 60% sure I wasn't delusional. 

issue: firasdib: did you ever get around to posting the speed differences with the c implementation? I'm still kind of shocked there would be differences You're just using space separated tokenization right? Parallel tokenization? 
solution: And this "binary" "can a neural net do x?" is a silly way to ask a question. 

issue: Hi, back from holiday :) I trained nn on 3 GPU and after one epoch it counted first three iteration and then it went to nans. Is there some recommendation what to do differently then when I am using only one computation unit? (GPU or CPU) raver119:  [<-LINK->] I am not sure what you mean as setup. this is NN config  [<-LINK->] gpu count is 3 
solution: 

issue: Instead of NaN-ing out of a sudden when learnRate is too high, can't we simply remember the latest best state and in case of NaN or n-times rising errors restore the best state so far and lower the learningRate? 
solution: in principle, sure... but the damage might already be done by that pointi.e., weights might be unreasonably large, for example. But right change of learning rate could get into optimal far better then waiting long time . And it should be only one epoch distanced. Otherwise you did lot of computing without learning your model anything. I am trying modify my problem to binary classification to simplify it and get better results as soon as possible. Do I want recordReader for it in same format (List<Writable> where first is image second is binary label) or do I want it to do differently. Using build-in record readers is not an option.. 

issue: you just need binary labels with an image? that is possible with ImageRecordReader, at least on master (not 0.9.1 though) with a custom PathLabelProviderotherwise yeah, 2 NDArrayWritables (one for features, one for labels) is what you want papperwing: yeah, it was a pretty recent change... [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: Dues anyone know, are there exists a support for FPGA acceleration in deeplearning4j ? Yeah, but there are exist some FPGA support in TensorFlow or Caffe platform, so i think that would be also possible in deeplearning4j .. so FPGA's is something in future, not present day ? 
solution: backed by someone else, beyond enthusiasts. for half of the planet even cuda gpus are still exotic.... 

issue: I use the dl4j -examples and I updated to the pom file. Since then I got and error "package org.datavec.codec.reader does not exist". Why is that? 
solution: 

issue: eypros: I'd recommend just building from scratch JusungPark: there's not much to it that's your confusion matrix What was matched was correct and what didn't was wrong It shows you correct vs wrong

solution: 

issue: ddsky: pretty sure that's fixed in 0.9.1 
solution: 

issue: There is support for InputStream, might work by feeding one? 
solution: 

issue: yeah, that may work, (assuming you're not switching from say CSV to JSON in the process)...@grayhairedwhat record reader are you using? depending on the format, youmaybe able to use this: [<-LINK->] 
solution: rangwank: they share some methods, but necessarlily there need to be some differences too (single in/out for MLN, multiple for CompGraph)but some work to that effect is happening here: [<-ISSUE->]. 

issue: smilebuddy: there is a known issue with evaluation in 0.9.1 - I think you might be hitting that... [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] eypros:  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: I have updated my pom file after a message that the main libraries don\'t have the same version. But strangely I have an error "package org.datavec.codec.reader does not exist". I deleted the folder "datavec" to be reimported (and it did after some attempts) but the message rersists. Any idea why is this happening. I have the dependency for "org.datavec" in pom file. My pom file is [<-LINK->] 
solution: eypros: check datavec pom.xml.

issue:  [<-LINK->] I wanted to remove fc1000 and for some reason it is not removed from new model. Am I doing it wrongly? 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I'm not understanding how the InMemoryLookupTable and VocabCache I provide to ParagraphVectors Builder (through the lookupTable and vocabCache methods) are being used.Even though I provide a prebuilt lookup table and vocab, the vocabulary is being rebuilt from scratch when I run fit().I expected the behavior to be the same as when I provide a prebuilt model using the useExistingWordVectors method, which adds the document labels to the existing vocabulary, without rebuilding it.Can someone clarify how lookupTable and vocabCache are used? I can't quite figure it out from the documentation and source code. Thanks. 
solution: if you’re sending pre-build vocab and lookup table. 

issue: Thanks@raver119,I ran again with .resetModel() set to false, and the vocab was not rebuilt on fit(), so that was just what I needed,however, the document labels were not merged into the vocabulary,  as happens when setting useExistingWordVectors,  so, my document vectors weren't learned,is there another parameter I need to configure to get this working? 
solution: 

issue: hi@raver119we have used awk command to filter unique values from data file from first column as suggested by documentation for nin but not working

issue: manijndl6: you have 8 input neurons defined, but a dataset with 9 inputs? show your reader line k he can read the answer when google indexes the channel :-) 
solution: lilalinux: if you have specific feed back we'd love to see it :D. 

issue: I saw you presentation on youtube and it was awesome and I can imagine how this works w/ RDDs or dataframes abstraction, but how the image/binary data work right, so spark doesn't help much w/ the binary data here 
solution: Which is all we use it for. So we do everything, off heap memory,gpu/cpu, ETL,image transforms,... 

issue: well, it can work well with the "normal data" (~feature vectors), where spark partitions it for you, then trains N neural nets and whith the reduce steps you average the weights, right? But I see your point that the \'training\' here is a black box for spark, because of the matrix ops and all that jazz

issue: woolfel: i highly doubt. that new stuff was released just 3 hours ago. dust should settle a little bit. 
solution: raver119: I haven't touched DL4J in months due to day job, but man the neural engine is inspiring me to get back to it.

issue: There is missing javaDoc in FileSplit. What is recursive for? Is it necessary to get from parent into labeled data? 
solution: I have structure like images/outside/data and images/inside/data is it needed to set recursive?. 

issue: Anyone how do you split your data? By hand before getting it into dl4j/datavec objects or is there some other way? rangwank: do you have balanced classes?

solution: 

issue: Labels array numColumns (size(1) = 2) does not match output layer number of outputs (nOut = 1)  why i getting this? 
solution: Nerijusas: Number of outputs in your dataset don't match the number of output neurons?. I LOVE THIS PART "You go to your boss/supervisor but they don\'t know either". 

issue: Because you are giving the neural net a dataset that doesn't match it's architecture 
solution: ivan4github: so if you specify threads number > 6, you’ll either start using virtual cores of HT, or you’ll be using cpu next door. and both options are bad for perf. 

issue: that’s pretty much generic ml/dl stuff any ml book will work 
solution: I need a short introduction to them. you can also check glossary at our website. 

issue: hi@raver119,  I was looking at the model.configuration output,is this not the correct place?

solution: 

issue: I would like to ask for help with evaluating binary classification model. Do I want to create EvaluationBinary with only one label? Or is it not necessary to use EvaluationBinary and normal Evaluation will be ok with that? 
solution: papperwing: then yeah, either is fine - Evaluation class can handle that. 

issue: Do you need normalizer.transform()? Or is normalizer.fit() sufficient? [<-LINK->] 
solution: lilalinux: normalizer.fit + setPreProcessor(normalizer) is all you need. AlexDBlack: Could you please check, if the MultiTimestepRegressionExample works for you?. I know, but it works for some. So I thought maybe it's an architecture problem.

issue: now I download a cudnn zip what can I do with that to use it with DL4j on eclipse (windows?) 
solution: rangwank: install it according to nvidia guide.. 

issue: In deeplearning4j/datavec, is there a way to connect with databases directly? I mean if I've database, what would be best way to get the data into datasetIterator?

solution: 

issue: Hi guys,  I need to implement per-row weightings somehow in the loss function - is it mathematically sound to have 3 labels, where the first two are my OK / nOK labels, and the third label is my per-row weight, I apply the weights of the third label to the first two labels and then set the third label to 0 before calculating score and gradient (such that when predicting my labels, the third-label prediction ends up always being 0 and I can just ignore it)? Or is that a stupid idea? 
solution: (my original plan was to fork dl4j and add a "meta data" input type, but then I realised that\'s way more complicated than my current knowledge permits and gave up lol). 

issue: Hi, how do I found out that 0.9.2-SNAPSHOT is ok? and second question. There is known bug that evaluation can be zeroed, when used doEvaluation. How do I force NN to use EvaluationBinary? Oh ok so I misinterpret it sorry for that. Thank you. About that time if it is not same it is not working? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: in the loss function, the labels seem to be normalized (or possibly capped at 1.0) even though I have normalize labels set to false - is there a way to get the original value of the labels? Am I doing something wrong? Actually, I think I know what the problem is sorry, lemme try something I managed to figure it out, user error - I was reading the array in with the wrong offset (did the maths wrong so it was using 1-based index instead of 0-based) But it's working now :)

issue: Hey people. Even with only 1 GPU (filtering using CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES), I\'m getting "Failed to allocate 140713104 bytes from DEVICE [0] memory" Is the support for GPUs broken in 0.9.x or what? 
solution: 

issue: Wilwilly: "Failed to allocate 140713104 bytes from DEVICE [0] memory" gives nothing. is it follow-up for your crash with pw? then what? 
solution: 

issue: Wilwilly: sorry,@agibsoncccwas right. in last case that's just oom, caused by multiple models trying to run on the same gpu. so that's not related to your original issue. 
solution: ideally - split over multiple devices. 

issue: raver119: is the algorithm used logged somewhere? I\'m not seeing any "cudnn" on the logs saudet: My log level is in DEBUG 23:15:44.278 [main] DEBUG o.n.j.a.c.impl.BasicContextPool - Creating new stream for thread: [1], device: [0]... things like this are logged ^ but nothing about cudnn  [<-CODE->] I have that  [<-CODE->] and that  [<-LINK->] this is the pom I'm using and before starting the application I did export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH I think that's all I needed yes, the code is basically this: [<-ISSUE->] (never mind the issue, it's unrelated to cudnn. check the code there only) 
solution: 

issue: Wilwilly: put your log level to DEBUG Aulig: 744 actions, yeah that's too much. We need continuous actions for that MatheusCalil: not yet, but it wouldn't be too hard to use ImageJ for that Then you don't have the deeplearning4j-cuda module in your dependencies: [<-LINK->] Well, please post a small example to reproduce that as an issue Ok, do you have a source file to go with that? You're not using any layers that cuDNN supports, if you're looking into accelerating LSTM, don't use GravesLSTM, use LSTM

issue: I get my output from the c-version sorted? Maybe thats becuase my input vocab is sorted, dunno 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] What can be the reason for the prediction to be that far off at the start? 
solution: raver119: is it possible to save a model and later reload it and continue training?. 

issue: What happened to Canova's TextInputFormat? Did it become something else in DataVec? Yes, I've read that. Thanks. What is the shortest path from the 20 newsgroups data to a DataSetIterator which can be passed to MultiLayerNetwork.fit()? Interesting. Okay. Yes I know canova has been merged into datavec but the nd4j docs refer to its TextInputFormat. What happened to this? What's the datavec counterpart? what newsgroup iterator? oh how did i miss that? See it on github. Can't find it with eclipse (shift-ctrl-T) I see dl4j-nlp among maven dependencies. oh well... I don't seem to have that class. Should it be in the nlp jar? 
solution: It's been in that jar since 2015. You keep imposing all sorts of strange non existant magic in to this process. 

issue: hey, im sorry if this seems dumb. but somehow i just cant get dl4j to work. i can create the configuration. but its just permanently stuck there. i've been following all the tutorials and by this point im pretty frustrated. anyone got a really quick fix for that? the process is still stuck at 0% CPU and no RAM for about 20mins now, also no code beyong the .build() statement ahs been executedi do know maven well enough to do this, but it just seems like a weird versioning thing just trying to do this [<-LINK->] not saying that its bad, but why is it still there then 
solution: 

issue: Sorry to bother you again@saudetbut do you think if i have an action size of 744 it would just slow down success from training a lot or should i not expect any success even with a lot of training? awesome, thanks@saudeti guess ill give it a try :)

issue: @saudetJust because I'm curious: Is a 0.9.2  far away?it's not going to happen in the next few weeks, if that's what you are asking... @dionisoleQuestion. Do i have to configure the network in some way for float inputs or normalization takes care of that???networks take INDArrays as input... normalization has nothing to do with the datatypebeyond that - look at what the examples do dispalt: open an !issue with all log output inc. full errors/exceptions... we can't diagnose it from that 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: What does the workaround fix? With the double preprocess bug fixed, the example works just fine: [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: well, of course - if you build from source or use snapshots. 

issue: In LenetMnistExample (in examples) is uses InputType.convolutionalFlat which produces a flattened vector (not images). On the other hand 2 ConvolutionLayer are specified. So is convolution layer applied or not? 
solution: so dimensions exist only in your imagination. So it's just a convention and I could use the InputType.convolutional configuration with no difference?.

issue: Why is SequenceVectors.fit() throwing exception "Multi-GPU word2vec/doc2vec isn\'t available atm" when working on multi-GPU systems?I mean, isn\'t it possible that I am working on a system in which there is more than one GPU but I set through Configuration object the CudaEnvironment not to allowMultiGPU, not to allowCrossDeviceAccess and to use a specific device?Moreover, the cited exception message is referring to availability of primitives to work properly with such a system or temporary fully loaded system by someone else?@raver119 
solution: 

issue: raver119: talking of GPUs, any update on the issue I opened? Can I help in any way? btw, I noticed a lot of time per iteration is spent normalizing vectors, which is something (I believe) cannot be cached (ie, saved on disk for later use) is that the case?

issue: I am trying to install nd4j in my local maven repository. The build fails. Before the failure I get the warning: [WARNING] Rule 1: org.apache.maven.plugins.enforcer.RequireFilesExist failed with message:!!!

solution: 

issue: Weird stuff happened to me. I learned model at it gave me 0 score on every iteration and epoch. So I took model and tried to eval the same data (which I expected to be nicely separated when score is 0) but instead i got this: [<-LINK->] It happened after I chose Nesterov as updater on ResNet50 
solution: 

issue: Is it normal the net is training "well" with nesterovs, but if I use rmsprop it throws a lot ofHit termination condition on iteration 0: score=0.0, oldScore=0.0 ? 
solution: 

issue: StefanoSamele: I am not sure what your question is. It would be better if you showed me a piece of code you've written that uses the transfer learning API and ask me what the question is around that code. Here is a link to the relevant part of the source code  [<-LINK->] Most of the code in here is building a new ComputationGraphConfig with parts of the config from the graph you give it and then modifying it based on what removeVertex/adds etc you do OssamaAlshabrawy: eval.evalTimeSeries(labels, predictions, masks) ajohnsonz: I don't think it's inherently bad that you score is negative. It's a lot more important that you are setting up your gradient correctly. The gradient of your loss function that is 
solution: OssamaAlshabrawy: You need to know what masks are when you do RNNs with variable length time series. Read the page on RNNs. 

issue: Hi, how can I get the model output if I'm using ComputationGraph?I've tried: INDArray output = model.output(false, dataset.getFeatureMatrix()); but did not work Any suggestion? 
solution: 

issue: eraly: Ok; since it involves a custom layer, can I pm you? Also I might need to prepare a couple of gist; this might take me a little bit... 
solution: But you can also write an issue and someone will eventually get to it. 

issue: I'm trying to concat 2 INDArray with [3,5000,2,20] so that I get [3,10000,2,20] but Nd4j.concat(i, a1, a2); fails for any i of 0,1,2 My bad, when I created the initial array, I specified the rank and it created another dimension 
solution: just to that in recursion if you want that. 

issue: How do I get the 5000 20th values of each first of 2 inputs in [3,5000,2,20]? I tried data.tensorAlongDimension(20, 0); but that return the 5000 first values of the 2nd inputs 
solution: kindlychung: WIP.. 

issue: the output range is [-1,1], using Activation.IDENTITY and LossFunction.MSE, the net does not study. but map to [0,1], it does. why? AlexDBlack: I know why the output range for [-1, 1] does not study, and mapping to [0 / 1] learning, but the effect is very poor. Because most of the label values are 0 and the output is [-1, 1], it is easy to fall into the local optima(0), and [0, 1] needs to learn to find the local optima.

issue: Hi guys, is there a way to export word vectors computed with dl4j so that they can be read by gensim? 
solution: 

issue: Hello, after applying a transform in data (e.g. RotateImageTransform) is there an easy way to check the rotated images optically? I know about showImageTransform but this example just shows the images before any transform. What about after? I need to apply again a showImageTransform after using a different transformation? 
solution: In the ImagePipelineExample I just added a rotate transformation like: "ImageTransform transform3 = new MultiImageTransform(randNumGen, new RotateImageTransform(45), new ShowImageTransform("Display - after ", 2000));" but it seems that it doesn\'t work. The displayed images are just single colored (like all pixels have the same rgb values). What\'s wrong?. I also checked the RotateImageTransform alone substituting ShowImageTransform with it "ImageTransform transform2 = new MultiImageTransform(randNumGen,new RotateImageTransform(45));" but it keeps producing single colored images. What the issue with that? RotateImageTransform  isn\'t functional?. 

issue: eypros: There is a display image transform See the examples 
solution: eypros:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: When I'm using large mini batch sizes (e.g. 0.5 training size), the output of rnnTimeStep() looks suspiciously shuffled. [<-LINK->] I'm doing data.tensorAlongDimension((outputNum+1) * numberOfTimesteps - 1, 0) to get the last value of each example And that output looks strangely interleaved (can't provide a screenshot currently :-/ ) AlexDBlack: Isn't that exactly what the MultipleTimeStepRegression example does? [<-LINK->] AlexDBlack: Would it be possible to replace them by something better? 
solution: 

issue: In the examples I could not find any use of RandomPathFilter just its subclass BalancedPathFilter. If I don't want to have exactly balanced dataset for example with 2 classes with a cardinality of 1/1.2 I couldn't use RandomPathFilter? Or it's not recommended?

solution: 

issue: It really depends on your test set. I mean if your test set will be images from a chess board probably will be okay But if not you might have trouble For eg. The net might just learn what an F on a border looks like to recognize a bishop and that will not help you 
solution: So, if picture of train data contains 1 full size chess piece and part of another it is ok for it? Will it recognize only 1 full size piece?.

solution: 

issue: Anyone familiar with RL4J here? I'm implementing MDP and it's not going well.. 
solution: 

issue: ajohnsonz: thanks. But AnimalsClassification deals with images. My specific task at hand is classifying text documents. That's why I was originally looking at ParagraphVectorsClassificationExample. 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: : btw, I think this code is faster for writing nd array to images -- besides the int conversion, it doesn't have to for loop individual pizels: [<-CODE->] the key difference is using getpixels / set pixels instead of getting/setting individulapixels from bufferedimage

issue: raver119: how to see what version of cuda is on my m/c 
solution: I need to check that library, since that’s cosine sim - there might be gemm used inside on normalized matrices. change backend to cuda-7.5. 

issue: oh great.. i will make sure i will udpate my AMI instance 
solution: Yeah, even without duplicating the array (I just passed in the same INDArray in for both arguments to Transforms.allCosineSimilarities), it's been running for 10 minutes now.

solution: 

issue: After max warm-up & preallocation squeezed is 304 us for add and length. Sounds like native backend is not very usable for the small data sets. Do you have pure java one? 
solution: to be fair, we haven\'t optimized for that the "tiny inputs" use case and don\'t really care tonative backend has some overheads (conext switching, etc) but we gain things like AVX etc. 

issue: Hm, maybe we should upgrade me to something that involves some magic AI? Unfortunately, i'm just a bot and can't get beyond that yet to answer you :( 
solution: rev19: probably because of joining this channel. 

issue: yelangchs: we don't have conditional reductionsbut you can copy your array, use boolean indexing to replace the NaNs with 0s, sum, then count the number of NaNs with MatchCondition op to work out what do divide by 
solution: cpuheater: Nd4j.cleanNans and the result is replace the NaNs with 0s, then mean(), the number is not correct.. ironflood: weight arrays are on each output... with sigmoid + xent, each output is already independentso a weight array probably won't make much difference. 

issue: viluon: I think@rubenfiszelmeant to do some normalization with that, but it's not used at the moment AFAIK, just make sure you values are in [0, 1] range 
solution: 

issue: lilalinux: rnnTimeStep has nothing to do with minibatch sizeand it has nothing to do with training or testing data in general... it's for stateful predictions(see? this is why we removed those examples) lilalinux: it's relative to what you pass in... and has no relationship with training minibatch sizethink about what rnnTimeStep does: it has stateful predictions... forward pass given stored RNN state for last time stepyou can't for example start predicting for 3 examples, then next time predict 5 without first clearing the statet to start from scratch - it just doesn't make sense (theres' no state for the new examples, and it's not even clear what you could mean in that situation) 
solution: 

issue: raver119: You want me to avoid the Transform.cosineSim call ? Is it cpu heavy ? 
solution: if you're ok making loops etc - fine with me. raver119: Agreed but it is also calling getTopN method which is also using a loop.

issue: My data are images. It's an expanded dataset of animals. MultipleEpochsIterator is an implementation of datasetiterator, whouldn't this be sufficient? I should implement my own implementation? 
solution: either number of epochs, or number of datasets serverd etc. 

issue: using the same model for training and testwhat do you mean by this?

solution: 

issue: Hi! FeatureSelection or Feature importance, where should I go? That is, for a NN in dl4j, is there some magic way to find which features are most important? I understand that by using L1 regulariazation, you\'ll "zero out" un-important features. But what do I do afterwards? Sum up the absolute weights on the first layer? I read somewhere that there is an algorithm that uses the first two hidden layers' weights to compute some importance-metric for each feature.. Is there something like this implemented in dl4j? It is really good that the threads that dl4j/nd4j creates have proper names! However, I\'d suggest that all threads were prefixed with appropriate prefix, e.g. "nd4j: UniGC thread 0" would really quickly help me understand what was fired up by who..

issue: Is it possible to give me a clue wrt. Workspaces vs. the "old mode"? I've read the webpage! My understanding so far: The standard mode is that the JVM GC handles cleaning of both heap (as normal) but also resources outside, i.e. the GPU. The workspaces mode is a more explicit handling, whereby when you wander outside the "try-with-resources" block, the resources are dropped? Will you not be bothered by the GC stuff then? 
solution: Currently, there are a set of threads named "UniGC" ( [<-ISSUE->] - [<-ISSUE->] ) - and they seem to do an awful lot of work.. 

issue: There is something I find confusing in the dl4j examples: [<-LINK->] the net apparently has two layers, namely an input and an output layer.Though the first layer has "numHiddenNodes" outs and the second layer has "numHiddenNodes" ins.Why is that? raver119: of course the numbers should match, but shouldn\'t the inputlayer have "numOutput" out or the outputlayer have "numInput" ins or something like that? Formulated differently, if my network has 3 inputs and 4 output, it doesn't make sense, that the the input layer has 16 outs and the outputlayer has 16 inputs, or does it? At least if there are just two layers in total. It's just a question how to use your API, I cannot find anything in the javadoc and I can't figure out from the examples. Maybe I just missunderstand something, but when I have two consecutive fully connected layers, one has 6 nodes and the next has 5 then there are 30 connections between them. So is this the number of outputs of the first layer and the number of inputs of the next? 
solution: So second layer nin will be 200.

issue: I cant find WavFileRecordReader or Native AudioRecordReader on dl4j may I get help? 
solution: cool. 

issue: Commands are: gist; examples; book; issue; tuning; docs; start; persist; javafx; workspaces; qq; snapshot; spark; memory; eval; Put ! before any of those commands to be accepted 
solution: So when I invoke !docs I get a predefined answer for example?. 

issue: well, can you imagine what it's like to type the same thing over and over (i.e., answer the same questions), 10x every day? :)that's why 
solution: 

issue: please use !gist next time. you're not first day here :) 
solution: 

issue: Does early stopping work with anaomaly detection? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: so you're telling me you have a closed-source solution for model serving and that I should file an issue in the DL4J tracker? 
solution: You can write it :) You can use WeightInit.Distribution an then you can set mean and standard deviation so that it cannot be under 0 :). raver119: In my opinion WeightInit.Distribution is not enough intuitive especialy with .dist fucntion which you need to use.

issue: Hi all! I am trying to migrate some of our Spark ml pipelines to finally use dl4j networks. Do we have any instructions how to possibly get the spark ml related API nicely included in my maven projects? 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] <-- this is kinda crazy, convs were giving incorrect results for a while ? 
solution: yeah, the 'for a while' meant it was in the past, not right now :-). and yes nd4j was invented in 2014. 

issue: agibsonccc: what do you mean "height/width are separate"? You mean they are inserted in setInputType? But so it is nChannel right? Why explicitly put it in nIn? 
solution: agibsonccc: : does dl4j provide convolution, or is it just full conv net ? [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Sorry to persist but to get it fully understood if I don't insert nIn it's not implied by the setInputType? 
solution: eypros: you don't need to insert it no. that's the point of set input type. the height/width are defined by filter sizes. 

issue: If I want to use an VGG16 pretrained CG... Should there any preprocessing using a scaler oder preprocessor? oder =or

issue: Hey :) ive got a small question about dl4j versions for importing Keras models. On this site ( [<-LINK->] it tells, that the Keras Reshape layer is supported, but on version 0.9.1 im getting "org.deeplearning4j.nn.modelimport.keras.UnsupportedKerasConfigurationException: Unsupported keras layer type Reshape."Is the Reshape layer only just coming with version 0.9.2?And do you guys know, when 0.9.2 will launch? 
solution: For DL4J issues, click 'New Issue' at [<-LINK->] - for ND4J, use [<-LINK->] instead. 

issue: Good afternoon. Has anyone managed to get the RL4J examples to run on Linux? I\'m getting "Could not find artifact org.nd4j:nd4j-native:jar:linux-x86_64:0.9.2-SNAPSHOT" in Maven. (full error output: [<-LINK->] ) papperwing: Oh, sorry to hear that. Is it just a matter of it being rebuilt and uploaded, or are any bugs blocking it? 
solution: 

issue: I see - I've only just started using Maven and am still getting the hang of it. Does it suffice to change rl4j's pom.xml to the version I want? 
solution: So why are you cloning projects?. 

issue: I'll do that with my own project. However, the above error appears when running the examples - is there a way to change the version the examples run? Yes, I got the 0.9.2 from the repo. Is there a 'cleaner' way to get the 0.9.1, or am I fine with just editing the pom.xml? 
solution: you changed it.

solution: 

issue: Hi, I am working with  ParagraphVectors and it seems that I am missing something? [<-CODE->] When I read it back using [<-CODE->] Getting the item embedding via the item ID can be correctly done via [<-CODE->] which results in an array like [-0.04,  -0.02,  -0.02,  0.06,  -0.01, ...But, if I infer the vector using the same content which that document had like [<-CODE->] I get an array with zeros, like: [0.00,  0.00,  0.00,  -0.00,  0.00,  -0.00,  -0.00,  0.00, ... @raver119 Ah, you are right, it's just trimmed to 2 decimals, now I see that there are actually values like 0.0049I've trained for 5 epochs on cca 1700 documents (i.e., their descriptions). I also did not normalize anything. [<-CODE->]

solution: 

issue: raver119: - hi there... continuing on my cuda issue from yesterday...  can't figure out how I should be using deps walker for java dependencies.  any suggestions of what you meant? 
solution: btw - i've spent some time digging through the internals of deeplearning4j/nd4j... really solid codebase for a large project.  kudos to you guys. 

issue: there should be  temp folder created automatically, and some dlls extracted file an !issue please, and post your FULL gradle config there as gist 
solution: when you build from sources you should start with libnd4j, then build nd4j, then DataVec, and only after that - dl4j. however, only libnd4j isn\'t really primitive. others are mostly "mvn clean install -DskipTests". 

issue: i don\'t understand this error i try to use DBN with csv file  "Exception in thread "main" org.nd4j.linalg.exception.ND4JIllegalStateException: Invalid shape: Requested INDArray shape [46, 0] contains dimension size values < 1 (all dimensions must be 1 or more)" 
solution: markbrandenburg: that\'s still "sequential" problem, so if your sequence isn\'t ultra-huge, LSTM is the way to go. 

issue: AlexDBlack: I am trying to adapt your GraveLSTMCharModellingExample to predict characters, but I am having trouble at the place where the dataset is created ( Dataset ds= iter.next() ).  The iterator object exists, but it has not "next() " ...  I hacked the getShakespeareIterator (...) method , and this method  returns the contents of the file with lines like "A,A,A,B,B,A,B,A,A" ( 10 lines like this ) ...     Actually what I want is to train the NN  with data like that, and then predict the next character for a test data like  "B,A,B,B,B,A,B,A,A AlexDBlack: Is there a better way to do such prediction ? Thanks 
solution: 

issue: What is the recommended way of getting a DataSetIterator for LSTM training from a Scala Sequence? (There are classes for extracting CSV data from files, but what if it's already in memory as a Vector[Int]?) 
solution: brentsony: well, there's bunch of iterators that takes java float[]/double[] or INDArray. leewangon: no, pw won't work with w2v.. 

issue: is there any dl4j code for word2vec using multi gpu? 
solution: 

issue: Mounir99: ok, so numClasses=2 is correctthen either your labels aren't in column index 4, or your data in column 4 doesn't contain only values 0 or 1 as it should for 2 output classes 
solution: 

issue: Hey, I get "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" error when I try to use MultiDataSetIterator in a ComputationGraph having 2 output classifier. Here is how I configure the MultiDataSetIterator: [<-LINK->] Any idea how to fix the issue? agibsonccc: Sure, I'll. Should I issue a ND4J issue or DL4J? agibsonccc: I've created an issue in dl4j: [<-ISSUE->] I look forward to hearing from you guys. Thanks. 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: , one more question regarding Word2vec class. In my code there is loop, which calls the word2vectors.wordsNearest(word, 10) many times while I processing a batch of files. I want to find the top 10 related words for each word in the loop. After I added this 'word2vectors.wordsNearest()' code, it slowed down my program a lot. I have to terminate it. The word2vec model I trained is 934M, not too huge.. Does that mean /this method isn't supposed to be called numerous times? 
solution: The public google-news word2vec model can be used, which is slower than my model. It's 1.6G. I guess it's because it has to search for a large space.. 

issue: Hi I am getting this error..does any one has solution for this Cannot do conversion to one hot using batched reader: 10 output classes, but array.size(1) is 2 (must be equal to 1 or numClasses = 10) does any one have the solution for this ???

issue: does it work to get consulting gigs? 
solution: well for us we aren't trying to really get consulting gigs. it just looks good in the board room and helps sales distribution. 

issue: Now I connected a secondary gpu to monitor the result However, dl4j also allocated the memory in this secondary gpu as well The primary is GTX 1080 and the secondary is GTX 750 
solution: to limit CUDA use for specific devices only. 

issue: Hello All , Just want to know that if DL4J word2vec is distributed and can work in cluster ? 
solution: 

issue: Why is your epoch starting at 1? did you try calling reset() after the fit on  trainIter? 
solution: 

issue: Tum4ik: if you're just going to start tuning etc - i'd recco to split those tasks. i.e. preprocess your data once, save it and then once it's really ready and tested - start with nn otherwise you'll be doing the same stuff over and over plus, having some tests in pipeline never hurts so, do what adaim said, and save results. just to save your time. 
solution: 

issue: So, the mvn compiles but while running i am getting: Caused by: org.nd4j.linalg.exception.ND4JIllegalStateException: CUDA backend requires compute capatibility of 3.0 and above to run. i am using CUDA-8.0 
solution: rpatra: that usually means - you have old gpu. you might be able to compile libnd4j/nd4j manually to work with it. 

issue: And any info when will be snapshot available if it isn't yet? 
solution: if you want that option right now - you can just build from sources. 

issue: I was trying to understand how the weight update is done in your cudnn models via the calls to cudnnRNNForwardTraining etc. Are there particular methods or files that any one could point me to?

issue: Hey, I'm training a customized skip-gram and I have difficulty in training the model using softmax activation function. May I know how to use the Hierarchical Softmax as an activation function? If it is not supported, could you please point me to where the Hierarchical Softmax implemented in Word2Vec in dl4j? 
solution: 

issue: In the examples I found this code net.output(INDArray input, boolean train) and I was wondering what's the difference between train=true and test (train=false) in the code. I  mean this code estimates the labels of the samples right? Net is a MultiLayerNetwork. 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: thanks. I found also this statement: conf.set(CodecRecordReader.RAVEL, "true"); and I found that the 2nd parameter "converts an image in to a raveled tensor". We should have it always true for videos or is it meaningful to also use false. And besides that is the configuration (defining the video dimentions etc) necessary for CodecRecordReader to work or we can skip it? 
solution: 

issue: which uses javacv u nderneath no that's way out of scope numpy isn't pandas for datavec sure but nd4j isn't going to have that datavec is the etl lib wait what o_0 so you realize datavec isalsoa lib we maintain right? it's not that we wouldn't do it it just makes zero sense in nd4j 
solution: 

issue: back to what you do. Do you plan to add an apply(func) method on INDArray like in pandas.Dataframe in Python? I saw there is a thread on github. But are you currently working on this? OK, too bad :( but i understand. code doesn't write itself you have to focus on one thing at a time

issue: raver119: could you answer my question please? 
solution: 

issue: Hello! I am trying to build a network that will be able to classify text by its context (something around 500 words, and 14-15 classes), using very specific words (it's for police, so it's gonna classify crimes and other stuff), and in Russian language - (rush b, and stalinium)  (so i can't use existing word Word2Vec libraries) - can somebody advise me some good tutorial - for a complete noob..  or maybe link to github with similar project - that uses it's own data (not movie reviews.) 
solution: 

issue: 32 is often way to little to get high speed, though. You're working with CPU? Get a GPU! 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: Like you suggested yesterday regarding the slowness of the method word2vec.wordsNearest(word, 10), I filed a story here for you to review it: [<-ISSUE->] Hopefully there will be some solution to it. Thank you.

issue: I want to load a previously saved DQN model and train it further with RL4J. It was saved withDQNPolicy<EncodableObservation> pol = dql.getPolicy();pol.save(modelSaveName);I know I can load the policy and evaluate it with the following:DQNPolicy<EncodableObservation> policy = DQNPolicy.load(modelSaveName);policy.play(mdp);However, I don't know how to extract the DQN from the policy to train it further. I thought this would work:DQNPolicy<EncodableObservation> policy = DQNPolicy.load(modelSaveName);QLearningDiscreteDense<EncodableObservation> dql = new QLearningDiscreteDense<>(mdp, policy.getNeuralNet(), QL, manager);However, the getNeuralNet() method has protected access, so I can't call it.

issue: Hi, I have a question regarding thenumPossibleLabelsparameter of the [<-LINK->] constructor. Is this the number of different class labels - for MNIST this would be 10 - or the number of targets - for MNIST this would be 1? 
solution: It would be 10 in the case of MNIST, that's right. 

issue: that's an issue with one of the plugins for the examples, not DL4J... you should be able to remove it without issuewe haven't thoroughly tested DL4J with Java 9 (afaik), but I wouldn't expect too much in the way of problems... right, in the future you'll only be able to do something like .updater(new Adam(0.01)) to set LR

issue: I am (still) trying to troubleshoot my unexpected memory consumption from yesterday. I noticed in VisualVM that the Heap is 5G, my used heap is 2.6G but the RAM memory in my machine is already 9.7G! As far as I know I am not using workspace for training but I am using SEPARATE for evaluation ([training: NONE; inference: SEPARATE]). Is this normal? No I did not skip it. I did not get it though. From the example you indicated [<-LINK->] I could not find out how to invoke it in my code. So it 's a JVM argument?

solution: 

issue: Hello guysI have a deployed a basic dl4j project on my windows system.This project was built on windows thorugh maven and a war was deployed.Everything worked like a charm.Now the issue is that the same war fails to work on linux system.Error : no nd4j backend found !I believe that its because my war contains a jar named nd4j-native-0.8.0-windows-x86_64.jar.Possibly there should be a linux version of this jar. While building the project on windows my nd4j-native dependency must have asked for windows openblas implementation.Is my logic correct or am I missing out on something ? 
solution: So nd4j-native-platform should work i hope.. 

issue: hello - I was wondering what is the difference between run my network with ".iterations(100) for 10 epochs" vs. ".iterations(1) for 1000 epochs" ... shouldn\'t the outcome be similar (from experiments I did it looks like "no, it is not") ? you deprecate ".iterations()" ? 
solution: 

issue: is there any rule of thumb on what it means when the score is decreasing as expected but contains period spikes? (like here: [<-LINK->] ) it's a simple MLP with one hidden layer 
solution: pertl: does it corellates with specific iteration number or epochs?. 

issue: Sorry to ask again but I cannot seem to be able to change workspace in my pretrained VGG16 model. I tried some approaches but workspaces are not affected. Why is that?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: eypros: I use this "graph.getConfiguration.setTrainingWorkspaceMode(WorkspaceMode.SINGLE)". I've extended the minibatch iterator with a little xz compression. But cannot get it working. When it decompress, it's fine, I can print the indarray of features and labels and it's ok.But evaluation is wrong: F1-score is 1, and 6 over 8 classes are never predicted.. 

issue: When using workspace, the VRAM memory will surge at the beginning and then:Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: Failed to allocate 1463133184 bytes from DEVICE [0] memory 
solution: When that failed to allocate memory happens, there were no warning about memory overload.

issue: Are INDArrays immutable? There's asetData(DataBuffer db)method, but no methodsetDouble(....)to set values at indices. Duh. OK, thanks. Too bad we can't use the type system (generics) to track the shape of INDArrays. The lack of types is what makes me not want to use python. Can I have an INDArray where the first row is of one shape and the second row is of a different shape?

issue: Hi guys, question about dl4j @ spark, i'd like to use UIServer for a job running on spark and am getting:Caused by: java.io.NotSerializableException: org.deeplearning4j.ui.storage.InMemoryStatsStorageSerialization stack: [<-CODE->] I see that StatsStorage implementations are generally not serializable 
solution: 

issue: I try to build dl4j on macOS with "mvn install -PskipTestCompileAndRun -Pspark-2.11 -Prelease -Dmaven.test.skip=true" but I get awkward errors like these: "[ERROR] /Users/peter/Sources/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j-scaleout/spark/dl4j-spark/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/spark/impl/graph/evaluation/IEvaluateMDSFlatMapFunction.java:[43,8] call(K) in org.datavec.spark.transform.BaseFlatMapFunctionAdaptee cannot implement call(T) in org.apache.spark.api.java.function.FlatMapFunction"  - can anybody help ? :-( do I need to pin the scala version for maven maybe? or something like that? 
solution: 

issue: Hy,Can someone tell me what the score from ScoreIterationListener is, is it only the  avg. error for that particular iteration? 
solution: szingerpeter: it's the result of the loss function averaged through batch size. 

issue: alexgeunholee: can you please post full stack trace and source code that reporduces this exception, as !gist alexgeunholee: file an !issue please, in DataVec repo it looks like opencv/javacv issue either file is malformed, or codec problem check word2vec methods, it had something like that 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys, I need to retrieve sth like a Hashmap<String s, double d> for a specific word (say w1)using word2vec. s is the similar word with the similarity score d compared to w1is there an implemented method to to that or should I do it myself? haven't found anything 
solution: use wordsNearest then. 

issue: crockpotveggies: what is dl4j-model-z project meant for? It should replace package inside dl4j in future or is it relic.

issue: I get memory allocation errors using the cuda environment... 2xGTX 1080 with 8GB RAM... Is there a possibility to train a VGG16 anyway? ...using this setup... 
solution: 

issue: I want to make Neuralnetwork by using Deeplearning4j for Android Apps in Android Studio2.3.3. Shoud it be better to install Deeplearning4j in my pc, or  only downloading source cord is better? 
solution: 

issue: there's shortcut available: Transforms.unitVec() a bit late advice though, sorry :) 
solution: I will test it after I return from school but I thing it gave me different values these two ways on same data. I will check it after I return (cca 2 hours). 

issue: So, the update will be available in the next version? Ι mean I am using 0.9.1 version which is the latest version I think right? 
solution: 

issue: I noticed that I have a parent pom file in my dl4j examples. I have an error message in line 90. I don't remember to have changed something in there. What should I do to deal with this problem? [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: i work in arabic sentiment anlaysis using recurrent neural network  so i found a problem dealing with word2vec anyone can help me 
solution: 

issue: google word vectors were built from google news, and it’s english corpus there’s just no arabic words within you’re going to build your own model it’s not that hard after all 
solution: 

issue: Are you guys planning to adapt into zoo trained mobilenets from tensorflow? [<-LINK->] 
solution: we’re working hard on TF import right now. And any estimation you could give (months years etc :D). come back when your grandkids are born. 

issue: Its quite hard to orient there for me :) I started from DL4J where a lot of stuff is premade and I am now getting into understanding what each of that premade stuff is doing on ND4J level. In ND4J there is a lot of references into c libs so it start to be hard for me there :D And unfortunately I would like to get into knowing it deeply but I have to finish my master thesis til 13 december otherwise they could kick me from school so there is no time to learning too much new stuff :D 
solution: 

issue: I can't remember how the old one was implemented, but the new one aligns with other libraries... that's just the iteration count [<-LINK->] not a parameter you set 
solution: 

issue: depending on your task it may even be faster to stay on cpu if you are looking to by anything less then a 980, or 1060 (also depending on the cpu :D) 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I've been working on Encoder-Decoder LSTM for 3 weeks and can't get what the reason of the exception I haveMy code is here: [<-LINK->] and the exception is here: [<-LINK->] I've been suggested that the problem is in LastTimeStepVertex line, but still did not get what is the problem exactly 38400 which is in the exception is double as the TBPTT length 
solution: 

issue: Dathiou: in one line? no. And it depends what you want to dofor dumping to a single file: you'll need to collect in driver (only works for small RDDs)for multiple files, use something like this, but with Nd4j.write methods: [<-LINK->] yes, input is nchw format (minibatch, channels, height, width)dimension 0 (minibatch size) needs to match. Otherwise it can be anything appropriate for the output layernote that OutputLayer expects 2d data, RnnOutputLayer expects 3d. So for colorization, you'll need something custom there most likelyor maybe just a simple reshaping to a flat/row vector for your image label, that should work I think 
solution: 

issue: DonaldAlan: we have that in the UI..but I'm not sure what you expect us to do. No framework really offers that withoutsomesort of work oh I know I'm just saying in general, your expectations are a bit much :D Usually if you don't have an intuition of this stuff You start from a paper where they have the visualzation Like I said, techhnically we have the visualization see the second link !tuning We could definitely do a bit more there to make it interactive though DonaldAlan: if you have concrete suggestions on what we could offer in the ui feel free to open an !issue What you probably really want is a layer building gui though :D 
solution: DL4J book (Deep Learning: A Practitioner's Approach) now available at [<-LINK->].

solution: In general the idea is to embed into the system kind of AI layer which will continuously learn what healthy system looks like and what anomaly looks like. The data available to feed the neural network are all metrics (these are already labeled data). 

issue: I've started seeing this exception when I'm doing training with the ParallelWrapper: https://gist.github.com/geekbeast/d6f1dd23c31677a305d98b39b8ce808bI've also seen a shape mismatch except and gotten core dumps off choices of particular values (mainly number of examples / batch size). Other weird symptoms for large sample counts it runs on my MBP and model scores well but exact same code trains model poorly on AWS c4.8xl.

solution: raver119: when I include the dl4j bin  jars  in my project,  everything works fine ...  but  the project is then 500 MB big, I am now just including the needed jars  ... ( I am not using maven in the project ). 

issue: For aMultiLayerConfiguration, there's a line.setInputType(InputType.convolutional(height, width, inputChannels)).  Can'tinputChannelsbe 1 and not 3? If so, then can't I use one color for the grey input to a colorizer? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: I'm looking at the docs for something I vaguely remember reading a while back, where it runs the network training several times with random hyperparameters, but I can't seem to find it - any suggestions what I need to search for? Ahh found it, nevermind - "Arbiter" is what I was looking for

issue: hi, i'm trying to make a  matrix product with a 2x7 and 2x1 ndarrays, but I can't find a way to make this work. someone can help me? is this a limitation of the sdk? because in python and matlab i can do this with no effort 
solution: ozeta: , Don't use `m1.mul(m2)'. That doesn't do matrix multiplication. That does item by item multiplication.. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] ozeta: You can't multiply matrices unless the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of the rows in the second.  You can multiply 7x2  against 2x1 but not what you have.

issue: agibsonccc: I attached the files to my issue: [<-ISSUE->] ForColorizerRecordReader2.javathe labelisa NDArrayWritable.   But I still get aIndexOutOfBoundsException. 
solution: 

issue: Are the any examples using Adam, or any other optimizer, directly? I'm working up a style transfer code which works by building the output image by minimising the error between the  output image and statistics from the input images. i.e. it is not training a network so I need to call the optimizer directly. 
solution: 

issue: Hi,I am training a word2vec model on a preprocessed wiki corpus using popular frameworks like tensorflow, gensim, originalc and dl4j. The issue is that dl4j's vocab size doesnt seem to be matching other framework's vocab size (456,940words for all other frameworks while it is454,022for dl4j formin_count=30). These vocab sizes are consistent across multiple runs on various cloud instances. What could be causing this?Weirdly, dl4j's vocab size matches other frameworks when trained on wiki corpus.Link to [<-LINK->] . 
solution: 

issue: hi, I managed to go further! Wanna know what it is? There are 2 version of the toolkit installer. One (the one I choosed) installs ONLY something that is referred to "CUDA driver", and is actually a dll.The other one named "networked", that took ages to download during the install process, installs TONS of stuff. And updated my display drivers and installed the actual toolkit 
solution: 

issue: Ok I understand. Btw, I finally got it working. I changed the number of hidden nodes to a ridiculously small number of hidden nodes and it DOES work...thanks for all the support. And btw it is awfully slow even using CUDA... I'll re-witch to CPU. But it was worth to try it 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: to sample equal class labels but don't want to split data into training/testing I managed to get that to work with split ratio = 1.0 just wondering about the more elegant solution back then when I first asked 
solution: 

issue: Hey@AlexDBlackdo you know maybe when this [<-ISSUE->] might be prioritized to be looked into ? thx, I thought already that you have enough on your plate :) I'll try to look further on my own and report if I find something 
solution: 

issue: Alex Black@AlexDBlackOct 13 00:43@devlop16you can do something like .lossFunction(new LossFMeasure()) etc on the output layer config. you don't have to use the enumerations Hi Alex this says  LossFMeasure can't be converted to LossFunction 
solution: 

issue: lacic: ye, i remember of this issue, but right now we're all very busy with graph & tf imports. i've checked tests though, they are passing once i get few free hours i'll take a look there i'd say: 95% issue is somewhere on your end. just not sure where exactly 
solution: 

issue: Hi All,I'm stuck in using Encoder-Decoder LSTM. I have 125 time series with the same dimension (19200x257) where the last column is for labels. I've got an exception but don't its reason.My conf is here: [<-LINK->] and the exception is: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Good morning everyone! Real quick: the scores (equal to the loss if I understood correctly) should be numbers between 0 and 1, striving towards 0, right? Do you have an idea what could lead to numbers above 1? 
solution: 

issue: I seem to be experiencing a strange problem, it's probably something incredibly simplistic but I'm failing to see what. (I am aware that I am effectively testing using training data) My bad: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: I apologise for my persistence, but when I useevalutateusing my scaled iterator - I'm experiencing a strange out of memory issue that isn't present during training. 
solution: Guide on memory management: [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Well considering the fact that VGG16() works with the same code maybe it's just that ImageNet weights for GoogleNet have some issue or something. I am not sure if I have mixed repos but shouldn't this throw an exception in VGG() also? 
solution: eypros: well if you read it for a second..it's tripping on a specific object type. 

issue: agibsonccc: I'll have a look over the time series again but there is no problem is the labels with the data in the same csv file, is not it? 
solution: 

issue: If I attempt to train a ZooModel using nd4j-cuda8.0-platform I get a strange ExceptionInInitializerError. 
solution: 

issue: this is what is making the first container fail 
solution: 

issue: raver119: in the definition of the training master,I  removed ".workerPrefetchNumBatches(2) " and am not getting the error anymore. Is it linked? 
solution: put that to the issue.. 

issue: is the exception of your first message triggered on the training data used to train the network, andusing the exact same ETL pipeline? Dathiou: wait, is it possible you addfile:/usr/share/aws/emr/emrfs/auxlib/*to your classpath ? Dathiou: seems there's a missing/in this :file://...would be expected 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: is there anyway to see the actual activation dimension? I would like to see where the dimensions are not fit 
solution: huitseeker: I will check that. 

issue: do I need to increase the driver memory overhead too? So far I have just put 5G as driver memory 
solution: I increased the off heap executor memory already. My question was about the driver memory.. but I guess my initial question was: why is one executor getting out of memory when the 6 others have plenty of free memory?. 

issue: Any idea to get DatasetIterator from Dataset? yes, I need DataSetIterator with one dataset... 
solution: 

issue: Any zoo keepers present to merge [<-ISSUE->] ? Finally got the zoo to compile, and run in the examples. Although on my crppy PC some examples do run out of memory. 
solution: Dathiou: it only does local but yo ucould back it up there. The second you add something like s3 you add complexity like authentication, network time outs, retries,... 

issue: papperwing: i'm not sure tbh, the only idea that comes to mind - rip off batchnorm layer using transfer learning api however,@AlexDBlackmight have better ideas that's easy. lets check out sources it definitely works in inference mode, but in different way it doesn't calculate new means and variances, and uses ones it learned during training 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys, where is the method to clear out / reset the workspace in between training runs? I've set up a basic random hyperparameter search but I seem to potentially have a memory leak (it's running in a local JVM, not Spark or anything)

solution: 

issue: yeah you can't use BufferedImage on android Are you using ImageLoader or NativeImageLoader? yeah 
solution: 

issue: hm, datavec for images should use internal android loader i've saw that in code O_o 
solution: 

issue: interesting that they don't show anything about single precision floats that is, the stuff that you would usually be using the p100 (pcie version) looses to the "consumer" 1080ti there But I'm simply going by the published numbers, just as they do, which are pretty meaningless if your dataset doesn't fit into memory, or if the gpu can't be utilized fully 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I wonder who I can congratulate for writing the eigenvector tutorial -- it's extremely easy to grasp and well written Well anyway, thank you dl4j. 
solution: 

issue: it depends. what exactly is the format of the data? is it images in flattened format, or a sequence, etc? Guiull: as far as data pipelines, it should be pretty much the same as RNNs - [<-LINK->] plus the RNN examplesthen you want to use the 1d convolution layers 
solution: 

issue: Is it possible to set manually values for my Network ? For example, I train my network and after I want to set manually values in the first layer to get my prediction I mean if a user want to predict the value of a stock, He enter the values like min, max, volume etc and the system will make a prediction based on the network that was created by training with the dataset I can do that with .output ?

solution: 

issue: does "No CUDA devices were found in system" when using "nd4j-cuda-(7.5|8.0)" mean there is definitely no CUDA or could it also mean some dependencies (e.g. nvidia tools) are missing? I have a NVidia GeForce GT750M on macOS 10.12 which is, based on nvidia, a supported cuda device ( [<-LINK->] ) I also have installed the CUDA driver 8.0.71 for macOS 10.12

solution: 

issue: short question about understanding where to use NormalizerMinMaxScaler preProcessor = new NormalizerMinMaxScaler(); When I create my Iterator I load all the data into a nd4j tensor. In hasNext() I create the DataSet as return value. preProcessor.fit() requires a input value from type DataSet. That is my issue... Do I have convert the nd4j tensor at the beginning into a DataSet for using dl4j Normalizer? 
solution: I know, I create in hasNext() one as return value for my minibatch. For using dl4j normalizer I have to create a DataSet object of all training data (not only minibatch). 

issue: it the CUDA 9 toolkit / driver downward compatible to 8.0 / 7.5 ? 
solution: cuda never was backward compatible. 

issue:  [<-ISSUE->] This is still broken :( What was the last working Keras version for 9.1? 
solution: KeironO: for now the only way to get working snapshots - to build them manually. but in reality its even easier: there's a script in dl4j repo.

issue: Is there something I can do to clean up (the memory?) after a training? It seems slower and slower and each step... workspace is Separate during training I remember having an issue with PerformanceListener. I will look again is there an example somewhere? 
solution: 

issue: Hey, I'm new to deeplearning4j, and I'm sort of struggling to go through the youtube lessons. How do I make a new clean-slate deeplearning4j  that uses no examples? Oh, by the way, why IntelliJ? I see. :/ Following the tutorial, I don't see anything that's super basic. I'm following this: [<-LINK->] Oh geez, I didn't know the youtube video would be so big. My bad. DX But yeah, following that, I was able to replicate it. But I can't replicate the file structure. 
solution: But that only had 1 thing to it. One file, and I'd just be able to import. I've not used Maven or anything else, and all of it at once is proving confusing.. 

issue: Memory is not infinite? 
solution: 

issue: alg-jmx: I'm wondering - do you have HDFS or a distributed filesystem set up on your cluster?those look a lot like local paths... 
solution: 

issue: do I need to install CUDA toolkit for GPU support or is installing the driver sufficient (macOS 10.12) ? 
solution: yes = the driver is sufficient?. Latter. 

issue: hey all, I'm busy setting up a dev environment on my win 10 machine - will cuda 9.0 be a problem with dl4j, or should i install cuda 8 instead? 
solution: 

issue: init does a lot more it initalizes updaters, layers, whatever else is there and setParams just sets params 
solution: 

issue: Yes workspace as separate for training And paramater averaging. I can't use the distributed unless I build from source 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: I am setting a schedule (map) and Shedule policy, then run the UI to check if the schedule is used. It is not. Then I  stepped through with the debugger and noticed (in 0.9.1)  that the policy is never assigned to the layer, even though the builder has it. 
solution: 

issue: edobm: Create a custom PathLabelGenerator and use it with the usual ImageRecordReader dmitri-carpov: same as 0.7.3 DonaldAlan: file an issue please Dathiou: nope, not yet 
solution: the red-yellow-green-blue part is not linked to dl4j and is my "pre-processing", everything in between is the training with dl4j. 

issue: The getting started page is all for Java, but dl4j seems to generally be Scala friendly. Are there any basic project examples in Scala just for MNIST or something simple? 
solution: 

issue: Thanx@agibsoncccI will contact with them as soon as possible.. The book is really good at theoretical and practical aspects of deep learning.  Thus, we have to take a great benefit from this resource. Not yet@agibsonccc. Because I haven't finished reading the book yet. Thank you so much@agibsonccc

My MultiLayerConfiguration is as follows: [<-LINK->] by 'nIn(?)', I mean I don't know what to do at this point. To be more specific, the nIn depend on the sequence length. AlexDBlack: Could you please answer my question in this issue: [<-ISSUE->] I have been waiting for 2 days now. I know it's weekend and everything is slower, but it'd be great if you could help me on this if you're available. AlexDBlack: I'm using :D AlexDBlack: I'm using RnnToRnnPreProcessor. So, I shouldn't be worry about the nIn. right? I think, I get error because of an incorrect RnnToRnnPreProcessor. Could you please have a look at it? [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Morning! Can someone please review [<-ISSUE->] ? The PR removes the remaining deprecated code from the examples. (Sorry to moan in gitter, but it has been sitting there for 6 days). Thank you! Once it was done it was very straightforward. (It took me 3 effforts to figure it out though).

solution: 

issue: saudet: this is what I was currently looking at. I am a little confused on what  targets.getSecond() is. From setTarget(...), it seems that the target is an array of nTransitions * nActions. and,getCurrentDQN().fit(targets.getFirst(), targets.getSecond());is actually using the target targets.getSecond()[0] (as seen on [<-LINK->] )so it takes the whole vector as target? and the loss function is computed on it? (and the gradients irrelevant to this action are also computed?) 
solution: 

issue: May I know how to use a ".inputPreProcessor(layerNumber, new RnnToFeedForwardPreProcessor())" in a ComputationGraphSpace? I know how to use it for MultiLayerConfiguration, but not in a ComputationGraphSpace. AlexDBlack: Thanks Alex, I tried to use the input preprocessor in a ComputationGraph ( [<-LINK->] ) but I get this error: [<-LINK->] AlexDBlack: :D Thanks. My bad 
solution: 

issue: saudet: any examples on how to use the masks? saudet: Thank you. I am surprised that this is not being used in rl4j. How is this handled? each transition has only 1 action and represents one data sample to fit the Q value function. If you have a network with multiple output neurons, how do you fit that? am I misunderstanding something? 
solution: 

issue: is there a way to convert a and INDarray to a java/scala array without a for loop? The reason why I am asking that is because I have been using org.apache.spark.ml.feature.MinMaxScalerModel to scale my features, and for that I need to convert to df. but I get: [<-CODE->] 
solution: I can create scala arrays and convert to INDArray afterward. 

issue: what do you mean a spark array? oh not really 
solution: I typed too fast. the problem is those are slow by nature.

issue: AlexDBlack: My arbiter already can run, thank you! There are some problems to note: TestSetRegressionScoreFunction.class can't  be serialized; the arbiterStatsFile should be deleted before uiServer running if it existed. AlexDBlack: if not  serialization, exception will be thrown.

issue: agibsonccc: thanks for your response. I saw that CUDA 9.0 and cuDNN 7.0 was supported in the master branch and I really want to test my GPU on it. 
solution: 

issue: So to do a recap, to run a MultiLayerNetwork in my own project (not dl4j-examples) I just need to use the pom.xml file? No need of extracting or importing jar in my project? 
solution: 

issue: @/allwe just published a DL4J programming guide. [<-LINK->] feedback welcome! jesuino: you can just file an issue here [<-LINK->] and give is a "documentation" label benqua: your best bet might be [<-LINK->] 
solution: benqua: I did not see an example, but sometimes the test gives you enough information to get started.. [<-LINK->]. 

issue: where do I file issues for this page? [<-LINK->] I saw minor issues with the sample codes - should I create issues using [<-LINK->] ? you guys now are starting a revolution with the great API for ETL and with transfer learning, it is time to build real world application more quickly - I am struggling with my neural net for weeks trying to get more data for my dataset and adjust parameters, still didn't pass 50% of accuracy -  I am sure that with the pre-built models it will much easier! chrisvnicholson: thanks, done - for some reason I am not able to label the issue, but it would be documentation with the lowest severity you have 
solution: 

issue: When creating layers, if an activation is specified in the layer definition is that activation applied before or after the layer being created? 
solution: Also, when specifying a ConvolutionLayer, I was using the ConvolutionLayer.Builder method of org.deeplearning4j.nn.conf.layer. This does not have a parameter for the number of filters, is this the wrong class for a 2d convolution?. 

issue: agibsonccc: , still a little puzzled. If a tokenizer is stateless, my wrapper for Stanford tokenier should also be fine, since only 1 thread will have a chance to access the tokenizer any time. I pasted my code, could you see any potential loophole for thread issue?  [<-LINK->] 
solution: chrisvnicholson: No way, I thought he was just an idea. 

issue: If I want to add two layers with parameters that define them, but I'm looking to save code not re-use weights, is there anything wrong with defining a single instance of the class and passing it to .addLayer multiple times? Egval bn = new BatchNormalization.Builder().activation(RELU).build 
solution: 

issue: Basically is it better to make a cluster with one big nose and several executors in this node or several smaller nodes with one executor in each? (It may not make any difference, that's why I am asking) *node 
solution: generally with spark, fewer JVMs per machine is better, if that's what you are asking. 

issue: AlexDBlack: , I just noticed that the DL4j-examples project are not on github anymore for checkout. Is that intended or I missed something recently? 
solution: 

issue: Hi everyone! I\'m new to Nd4J and I want to load a bunch of date values into a INDArray in the shape of "20170516". Unfortunately the values get formatted/rounded when loading them into the array.If I for example do sth like this:INDArray X = Nd4j.zeros(1, 1);X.put(0, 0, (long) 20170501);System.out.println(X); I get sth like this: 20170500.00 
solution: just think of it as 99% of the industry uses floats and doubles fine. 

issue: we've had ActivationLayer for quite a while, so it's definitely in 0.9.1 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I'm new in DeepLearning4j. I'm looking at the documentation and I'm wondering if the library allows the creation of a neural network (2-3-1) with one hidden layer of 3 neurons where each neuron has a different custom activation fonction (and so a custom backword propagation method). Thanks a lot for your help :) 
solution: letnotimitateothers: you can do custom activation functions  and layers. 

issue: Hi, does anyone know why nd4j does not support empty matrices? sometimes I want a matrix with N columns, but zero rows. This abstraction is available in MATLAB and numpy but apparantly not in ND4j 
solution: 

issue: rmeex07: that would be a two step process, first you would train the autoencoder, then you would use the encoding it learns as input for classification you can find !examples for each part in isolation in the dl4-examples repo combining the two is where you'll need to do some work on your own 
solution: 

issue: Hi!I'm trying to use org.deeplearning4j.spark.models.word2vec.SparkWord2Vec in EMR cluster the corpus is around 72k files. I'm getting a WARN about Aeron receiver and an WARN (out of memory) about Broadcast variables. Do you have any idea why?The word2vec configuration parameters are: [<-CODE->] Exception on nd4j: [<-CODE->] Warning on Broadcast: [<-CODE->] Thanks! 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: Hi, I managed to have a better understanding of Maven, watching tutorials, I want to ask: If I want to build a jar of a  dl4j project do I have to extract the jar dependencies on my jar file or just put the jar dependencies on my jar and link them via META INF? I'm not doing this myself, IntelliJ does it Of course I use "Build Artifacts" of IntelliJ

issue: Hi, I get this Error when getting the instance of UIServer: com.typesafe.config.ConfigException$Missing: No configuration setting found for key 'play'Can someone please explain what could be the problem? turambar: Yes 
solution: 

issue: FedeLux: a recent change to UIServer runs Play in "prod" mode (faster + better security) But requires extra config He just said he's building from source Read above And he has the play error That results from the recent change

solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: in Word2Vector construction, again this " .allowParallelTokenization(true)", it seems it uses 4 threads internally for tokenization. Is it possible to pass a parameter for more threads for tokenization, i.e. "10"? I found the reason. It can be more threads, depending on my computer. Thanks. "ParallelTransformerIterator.TokenizerThread[allowMultithreading ? Math.max(Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() / 2, 2) : 1];"

solution: 

issue: rmeex07: use !workspaces and don't use in-memory stats storage (use fileStatsStorage instead). Also reduce the stats listener frequency (via constructor) also double check your iterator isn't a bottleneck 
solution: for iterator, I am using. 

issue: AlexDBlack: , I loaded the ND4j-examples project, and those little examples seem working fine in IntelliJ. does that mean I don't need to install OpenBlas mysellf? I tried to install openblas on Ubuntu, but received an error message. 
solution: put another way: if it's not there, you probably don't need it. 

issue: lingvisa: you can't have 8 i7 cpus, they aren't supporting multi-cpu configurations so, you have 1 cpu, which has 4 physical cores, each of the cores provides 2 virtual threads so, windows-like systems will report it like 8 "virtual cores" but in reality it's still 4. just no sense using pw 
solution: 

issue: dskys: it's planned for next release, but it's not any kind of high-priority tasks. so high-prio stuff goes first. if you want to get your hands dirty with code - i can guide you what to do there, to implement workspace support in w2v etc lingvisa: your pom should be ok 
solution: 

issue: But DL4J users can't optimize those operations? They are handled by the platform? 
solution: well you can configure workload sizes. a lot of things impact it like batch size, hardware,... 

issue: yeah, beyond an error in your code, I'm not sure what could be causing that 
solution: 

issue: Hi all ! Do you know if it is possible to create a custom element-wise operation using ND4J ? I tried to implement my own BaseTransformOp but it doesn't seem to work properly.. 
solution: if you can compose it of existing ops it's not bad. Is it a custom activation or loss function of some kind?. 

issue: hi, noticed a wired fact, that you are using the terminologylayerreferring to where the hidden connections / weights lies at, but from the other books and papers I read, thelayerthey are referring at is the vector whereneuronslie at. so if I am right, why do you call it like this? is it a particular branch of terminology? btw, I am persuading my colleagues to working on dl4j, and he mentioned this difference. thanks 
solution: 

issue: honestly? probably the quickest thing at this point is if you can open an !issue with some code we can easily run locally to reproduce it the code snippet you are providing looks correct so it's either a bug in some other part of your code, or in ours (though the normalization functionality is pretty well unit tested) sounds like it could be applied twice? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I\'m a newbie to DL4J project. I worked in Windows 7 + JDK 9.0.1 + Maven 3.5.2. When I run "mvn clean install", it shows the following error: 
solution: 

issue: julienbaladier: if possible, you shouldn't use INDArray to hold indexes, as@raver119explained earlier, they are floating point numbers internally, therefore the conversion to int is inherently lossy julienbaladier: anyway, the reason is that toInts iterates over the array and gets every element individually [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: @AlexDBlack Hey, concerning my normalization issue earlier - I just found some piece of code that you wrote (https://github.com/eraly/dl4j-RNNs/blob/master/src/main/java/io/skymind/training/ibm/recurrent/seqClassification/UCISequenceClassificationExample.java)And it has the same issue for me. Calling trainData.next() after line 83 results in the wrong transformation. Has this worked at some point? 
solution: 

issue: If I want to compile and package the dl4j from the source code by myself, should I just run "build-dl4j-stack.sh" script in the dl4j home directory? 
solution: 

issue: After trying spark mllib for considerable time, I'm willing to move on to either dl4j or mxnet. I like scala. mxnet seems more advanced, but doesn't have scala documentation (only python  ). I'm thinking of trying dl4j with java first, and eventually switch to scala on the same platform. The reason I don't like spark mllib anymore is, it's too limiting, and not mature enough. 
solution: 

issue: As somebody who is coming to dl4j from tf/keras, I've gotta say getting this whole thing running is sure a lot of work. Not giving up, but this isnotan easy lib to just add to a project and start training a model jvm support in dl4j is a godsend, it's the reason I'm trying to make this work :)

issue: Hey all, I am training an LSTM with CUDA 8 backend and a minibatch size of 100, I have 3 layers and a total of ~15.000 trainable parameters. Is it normal for training to only use about 25% of my GPU? (GTX1070) What could I do to improve this? raver119: Is there a way to verify that my LSTM is actually using cuDNN for training? There does not seem to be a .cudnnAlgoMode as there is for the convolution layers and the logs do not print anything about cuDNN either. 
solution: SanderGielisse: that depends on your layers. cudnn supports simplified LSTM impl afaik. 

issue: What is a decent minibatch size for training an LSTM? Seen a few examples that use a minibatch size of 10 or 20, but of course increasing this number significantly increases speed, since I train on 30k samples. Though when setting the number too high, the network will fail to generalize. What would you advise? 10? 100? 250? 500? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, im just coming back to dl4j after a while and wanted to use the latest snapshots, i am almost certainly doing something idiotic but my maven build cant seem to find the snapshot on sonotype, even if i go there in a webbrowser i cant see the snapshot folder, do you know what im doing wrong ? 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys. Any hint on what I need to do to fix this: no jnicuda in java.library.path, javacpp\\windows-x86_64\\jnicuda.dll: Can't find dependent libraries. I have CUDA installed on a Windows x86 64 machine. I installed CUDA 9.0.176 (seems like latest) maybe that was too bold?

issue: Hi, is it correct that the 0.9.2-SNAPSHOT is not on sonatype ? [<-LINK->] 
solution: i don't know, maybe@huitseekerknows. i was having a dependency mixup in my ide so i removed the repository, now i have regret. :(. 

issue: also,  could you try running "Ctrl+Shift+A" -> "Reimport All Maven Projects" and try running it again? 
solution: either use mvn that's provided with intellij, or install your own. that's cmd line. 

issue: treo: I did "Reimport All Maven Projects", getting the same exception. I can\'t get the command to work, but I can see my dependencies in the "Maven Project" pane on the right. Let me see what I can do. 
solution: poweigel: it should work just the same: press "Ctrl+Shift+A" and enter "Execute Maven Goal" in there, then enter "dependency:tree" as the command line. 

issue: raver119: @treoupdate: I recreated the example file from@treoand got it to run. When I copied the same dependencies and code and put it into the original file we were debugging, I got the same errors as before.

solution: 

issue: if you have labelled data, pretraining isn't necessary, but there might be some circumstances where it helps. I'd recommend avoiding it unless you have (a) the experience, and (b) a very good reason to use it 
solution: rmeex07: For some deep networks an autoencoder can help if you have significantly more unlabeled data. I had one project with only 5M labeled examples, but over 600M unlabeled examples and pre-training ended up helping. But as Alex said, it's not a normal practice and isn't relevant w/ only labeled data.. it's much less common to use unsupervised pretraining these days (due to better weight init and optimization methods), again, unless you have much more unlabelled data than labelled data. 

issue: Hey, what am i doing wrong in terms of config / hyperparams in my A3C implementation to be able to make the A3C framework have a reward stack of 0 height (minibatch)?

solution: 

issue: jasmine1363: do you have anaconda installed? I've seen related errors where anaconda shipped with mkl that is picked up by dl4j but can't be used with it

issue: I’d like to train a network with the Fourier transform of audio files. Is the best way to do this by converting my training set from .wav (time domain) to .csv in the frequency domain, and then use csvrecordreader? I’m guessing the WavFileRecordReader does not do this internally so I'd have to do some pre-processing on my data.

issue: Hey guys, how would I feed forward CSV files through my RNN network? I know about the SequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator, but that requires both the features and the labels, while the features are what I would like to classify, so I do not have the labels..? 
solution: 

issue: saudet: @ptulsthat's not in 0.9.1 it seems, I just checked but it'll be in the next release (which, unfortunately, won't be soon) best workaround is just .biasLearningRate(0.0) that will effectively disable bias (by keeping it at the initial value of 0) 
solution: SanderGielisse: sounds like you want an autoencoder.... SanderGielisse: one approach is RecordReaderMultiDataSetIterator (+ wrap in MultiDataSetWrapperIterator if required)you can specify "labels" as being the same as features. 

issue: In Word2Vec class, when I tested the SentenceIterator and DocumentIterator, it seems my log shows that Tokenizater is called different times: 6 & 9 when processing the same file. With sentence iterator, I pass the file name as filePath, while with Document iterator, I pass the directory name as filePath (in the directory, the same file exists). Is this normal? The log message is here: [<-LINK->] 
solution: DocumentIterator was supposed to be a way of doing InputStreams..they never really took off though. 

issue: I am getting exception after some time while running Arbiter,  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: rmeex07: you hadn't edited your output in any way? sure, but this kind of exception usually has some kernel crash message but in your case - i don't see single line about that :) no, sorry :) that's coincidence that' number of threads is placeholder, it has no effect for cuda backend can you please run your app again? i still think that there should be kernel crash message and it just got missed somehow 
solution: 

issue: can you please enable workspaces, and run once again? arbiter should support it too i think 
solution: if there's no kernel crash, ninja-oom becomes main suspect. i think arbiter should have something like that.

issue: any recommendation on the right gpu for dl4j (running on ubuntu) for personal purpose (getting into neural networks and achieve a solid level of wisdom :-) ? would you prefer the pricey "1080 ti" or instead get a "1060" ? 
solution: sounds like the 1060 is almost low-end. 

issue: memory matters a lot and 2x 1060 wont double vram for you mostly for io etc yes threadreapper is 1k$ i7 is 300$ 
solution: Fwiw I picked up a zephryus laptop which has a 1080 and an i7. 

issue: I will make it remotely accessible (using vpn on my router + wake on lan) so I can use it from the hotel room when I am on a project much cheaper than all this cloud stuff on the long run all is gone since steve is not there anymore

Thanks :D Oh, formatting failed :\\ Two But how can it guess 1 for 0 twice, if there only is 1 sample in the dataset? 
solution: ops are just labels for real work in c++. there also used to be a java impl a LONG time ago. 

issue: How many classes are there? Dl4j's eval class prints it out a different way usually it's more verbose but also more obvious so from the looks of it the left is 0 guessed 0 and 0 guessed 1 then guessed 1 for 0 twice guess 1 for 1 0 it's index based 
solution: 

issue: i'm running SigmoidDerivative via  Executioner like thisNd4j.getExecutioner().execAndReturn(new SigmoidDerivative(in));where is the code which calculates the derivative located, I have breakpoint set inSigmoidDerivative.sigmoidDeriv but it's not invoked ? :) so this whole class is for nothing now it's clear 
solution: 

issue: I seem to have isolated the issue. Its this, simply: building via maven (mvn clean install -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -DskipTests) on the nd4j master gives an error.  [<-LINK->] It is. libnd4j also builds fine. Its after that, at the nd4j step that this error comes Yeah, I'm kinda confused too - I've not seen such dependency declaration before. Google also did not help much. 
solution: 

issue: abhishekpathak: mind posting !gist with error? that's cyclic dep somehow org.nd4j:nd4j-native:0.9.2-SNAPSHOT' for org.nd4j:nd4j-native:0.9.2-SNAPSHOT is referencing itself. O_o happens. opening nd4j now there's no problem you'll just have 2x8 
solution: 

issue: Is your c++ toolchain not setup? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: Were you able to replicate the error of cyclic deps? 
solution: 

issue: Anyone have any suggestions on how to handle this exception? java.io.IOException: Could not locate executable null\\bin\\winutils.exe in the Hadoop binaries. I have tried downloading winutils.exe and setting my environment variables appropriately but nothing seems to work. 
solution: 

issue: raver119: Seems the problem is somewhere in my setup then. Any clue regarding that error of cyclic dependency? What exactly was maven unable to do? Mine is without cuda as well - its on macos 
solution: 

issue: abhishekpathak: knobs for the build-dl4j-stack.sh script are minimal, in that if you do not have need for something, there's no need to specify the optionI suspect you have not set the libnd4j dependency, and the build assumes your checkouts are available in sibling repositories abhishekpathak: otherwise said :for i in libnd4j nd4j datavec deeplearning4j; do git checkout https://github.com/deeplearning4j/$i; done 
solution: huitseeker: I have indeed not set and libnd4j dependency explicitly. Just exported LIBND4J_HOME. Line 225 in [<-LINK->] is where the issue is really coming - the script has cloned and built libnd4j, its trying to build nd4j (and failing), and datavec and deeplearning4j are down the line.. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Thanks. 
solution: 

issue: raver119: @huitseekerJust a shot in the dark - in my system (mac os) there is no LD_LIBRARY_PATH defined, which the pom for nd4j-backend-impls expects in<build>. Although libnd4j built fine, can this have some effect on the binaries? 
solution: abhishekpathak: just in case: i'm typing this message right from my macos. 

issue: abhishekpathak: i'm preparing nd4j merge right now, on linux though, so i recompile everything and looks lit compiles fine even with cuda  [<-CODE->] 
solution: I honestly don't know what is triggering the issue - seems like tracing the entire maven dependency resolution one step at a time is the only option left.. 

issue: suratsurat51: are you by any chance running that on mac? 
solution: 

issue: suratsurat51: so all your threads are just sitting around doing nothing, with 0% cpu utilization? 
solution: abhishekpathak: if you have anything custom in the global settings, yes, I'd like to have a look. 

issue: So, I think I've read enough to have ageneralsense of what I'm getting into. What would be the best way to introduce myself to dl4j? 
solution: Virepri: and then try to start small, not with some big ambitious problem, but rather something that you can thoroughly understand. 

issue: treo: The reason this came up was hyper-parameter optimization using a Guassian Process model, the implementation of which needs the Cholesky decomposition.  In a sense you can argue its not the DL itself, its the optimization of the hyper-parameters used in the DL.  However, if you're trying to build an automated system for training, having parts of it that have to hop back into Python-land is annoying.  Not strictly a killer, but annoying ;-) 
solution: 

issue: saudet: It built successfully using maven 3.3.9. Thank you so much! raver119: The sweet, sweet message finally  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: when doing prediction after training my LSTM, should I use network.output() or network.rnnTimestep() to feed forward my features? What is the difference, can't seem to find out... 
solution: 

issue: btw are you going to come up with a way to change the user/pass for CE? I'll probably should post something... but what I'd consider for AWS etc. is SKIL interface & Zeppelin to localhost, and use SSH tunnels I actually use DigitalOcean, but I had my config way too low but yeah... an AMI or two would be great I'd like to run it on my Zynq board... but that is definitely an unsupported config agibsonccc: Yeah ARM9 + FPGA for most Zynq boards 
solution: 

issue: I'm trying to build a multi-output model.  Starting from the CSVExample demo, I created a new CSV file with multiple label columns. I used DataSetIterator iterator = new RecordReaderDataSetIterator(recordReader,batchSize,labelIndex, labelIndex+1, true);  and changed the output activation from softmax to sigmoid (starting form CSVExample).  Everything worked, but performance was really poor.  Wondering where to look, api config error, or I need to tune the model. thanks, i'll check the loss function AlexDBlack: thanks, using XENT fixed my problem 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: I manually started the SKIL daemon on a running docker container Running systemd or sysctl etc. is practically impossible and silly from within the container How about I get a semi-working docker file, and attach that to the issue 
solution: 

issue: sounds like a good compromise. i'm also always eager to learn new theoretical background and i'd like to spend my whole day on reading ml books or new papers, though i even more enjoy applying what i learnt 
solution: 

issue: WTF. I can run the spark examples in IntelliJ??? Even if I do not have spark installed?  What’s going on here? 
solution: I did not know you could run these examples in intellij.  I thought they had to be submitted to a spark cluster (or standalone spark executor). 

issue: Hello,I am trying to decouple the gradient from the descent operation used for training neural nets with SGD.Could someone please tell me why [<-LINK->] is not working?The problem is apparently in the net.update() call.Any other ideas of implementing what I mentioned? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: have you seen [<-ISSUE->] ?Weird behavior withSequenceRecordReaderDatasetIterator. Probably shouldn've have posted this issue under examples though. 
solution: 

issue: The reason for that I'm running my code on a remote machine, plotting roc after each epoch and there is restriction related to loading any GUI. So, my code stop after 2 or 3 epochs AlexDBlack: So, do you think is there a simple way to achieve that? 
solution: well, sure. I gave you 2 diferent ways to save any IEvaluation instance including ROC, so....

issue: raver119: rewrote my code in java so you can have a proper look: [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: HiI'm wanting to have a play with word2vec, but the word2vec page doesn't match the current word2vec in maven?Currently using this<dependency>    <groupId>org.deeplearning4j</groupId>    <artifactId>deeplearning4j-scaleout-akka-word2vec</artifactId>    <version>0.0.3.1</version></dependency>is this right (and the correct version)? :) thanks for any help 
solution: check out !examples. haha, yeah i saw it was quite old and assumed something was wrong :PI'll take a look- thank you :). 

issue: I get that. But why are there NO TRACE of JavaDoc in those classes? I would not have accepted it, was I the owner of the code. Not for my own cause, even. 
solution: 

issue: Is only CUDA 8 supported or version 9 got support too? 
solution: frakc: cuda 9 is only supported in the latest release. 

issue: Im a bit tired of specifying number of features up front when using a CSVRecordReader passed into a RecordReaderDataSetIterator. Is there a simple way to just count the columns before sending into the RecordReaderDataSetIterator? 
solution: 

issue: show me nvcc version please, and cuda driver version also, please tell me: are you able to compile things from sources? :) driver version is available in nvidia smith there should be 370.xx.+ in your case 
solution: 

issue: ./buildnativeoperations.sh -c cuda -cc INSERT_YOUR_DEVICE_ARCH_HERE  <- I have 1080TI, what is my DeviceArch? 61 for 1070, evidently. Okay. CMake 3.8 or higher is required.  You are running version 3.5.1 Were you to fix that, or should I make? 
solution: and we're compiling.. 

issue: ./change-cuda-versions.sh 8.0 <- this? 
solution: 

issue: mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true <- this? Running. [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS 
solution: mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true <- this?. and the same cmd for dl4j as well. 

issue: Okay, where do I find the jars? I'm not to hot on Maven, so I have supressed all my knowledge about it. Need to do explicit file deps in Gradle, I presume. 
solution: 

issue: raver119: @AlexDBlackIs the final conclusion of [<-ISSUE->] basically that even though the network described there doesn't have very many parameters, allocating 8-10gb of memory is simply not enough to train it? 
solution: 

issue: Hi. I use paragraphVector useExistingWordVectors and got this error Model being passed as existing has no syn1/syn1Neg available whats wrong with my w2v build? here is the gist for w2v buid;  [<-LINK->] nvm figured it out 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I'm having trouble using transfer learning. As in dl4j example, I kept all layers but the last one frozen and modified the output. [<-LINK->] Comparing the weights of a frozen layer of the pretrained model and the weights of the same frozen layer of my new model trained for one epoch, I found that the weights that were supposed to be frozen have been modified.I got the same problem with both VggFaces and ResNet50. 
solution: 

issue: Trying to use 0.9.2.snapshot but it doesn't seem to be [<-LINK->] snapshots. Only 0.8.1 is there, any ideas? 
solution: 

issue: guys, I've got a strange behaviour when I fine-tune a network, like vgg, I get the first conv layer and print its parameters but at every batch those parameters changes, even if they should be frozen can be due to my code? conv1_1 (Frozen ConvolutionLayer) in the summary. So no way to change it, isn't it? 
solution: 

issue: bsheline: unfortunately, the only way to get yourself 0.9.2-snapshot version is to build it manually from sources at this moment vimalaguti: i'd be surprised if that's not due to your code. as i know all that stuff is covered with tests 
solution: 

issue: eraly: thank you, I ll double check but i\'m quite confident. Might be due to pretrained zip? I\'m using the vgg_faces and I know this pretrain is not "official" 
solution: 

issue: I guess I need to reboot the JVM? As the Nd4j..setProfilingMode is static? Oh god damn. Now it won't crash. Restarted Intellij, checked env vars of my shell. No DEBUG. Running again. 
solution: Just gotta check whether it goes past epoch 3 now.. 

issue: is it there anyway to add ".trainingWorkspaceMode(WorkspaceMode.SEPARATE)" in transfer learning? my prev. model does not set work-spaces option, but now I wan to add, is it possible? saudet: : .trainingWorkspaceMode(WorkspaceMode.SEPARATE) does not exist , method not resolved error 
solution: 

issue: rmeex07: Sure we can, an example here: [<-LINK->] stolsvik: We need to allocate pinned host memory, and that's a pretty limited resource, as it can't be paged out 
solution: 

issue: Hi all, quick question: I see that OpenCV uses the Mat class, whose equivalent in DJ4j in INDArray. In Python both are represented by numpy arrays. I was wondering: has anyone build something which uses both, and if yes, how? 
solution: 

issue: Are any of the datavec examples possible to run locally on a laptop with 8GB RAM or do I need to use another machine? 
solution: 

issue: saudet: @raver119I've commented in [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: Does anyone know, if it is helpful to add to a model a LSTM and Conv methods? agibsonccc: Im reading... 
solution: slow down on the questions a bit...we aren't going to teach you deep learning full stop in the channel. 

issue: yes, there should be no architectural limits on the length of sequences (well, obviosuly >= 1 step and whatever fits in memory)obviously, whether the net generalizes to the shorter sequences or not is a separate issue 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] Or is what I'm seeing just that the computation performed lazily and cond triggers computation? Which is why it appears to eat all the cycles?An excerpt of my code:https://gist.github.com/wadejensen/69a6aa949c5514c340dc58a9c41760a1 
solution: Nd4j.getExecutioner().exec(new MatchCondition(array, Conditions.lessThan(5)), Integer.MAX_VALUE)etc. 

issue: Hey, what is the DataSetIterator.totalOutcomes() supposed to return for a single target regression task? See [<-LINK->] 
solution: heh, well, once Spark Datasets support arrow (which is in the works, last I checked), we can start thinking about things in that direction too.... 

issue: Is there any way of introspecting / modifying how many SIMD lanes ND4J uses? Trying to assess how much of my speedup is C++ and how much is vectorization. 
solution: you can modify the number of threads easily (OMP_NUM_THREADS env variable) but not afaik whether SIMD is used or not (at least without recompiling afaik)... cc@raver119. 

issue: Hi@agibsonccc, i have a model to classify images with 2 classes. I want to retrain the model with new samples for one class. So i restored the model. I have used ImageRecordReader and RecordReaderDataSetIterator to iterate new samples. I verified my retrained model with the previous training samples. All samples goes to one classification. Did i miss anything in retrain? 
solution: retrained with only one class of images? that probably won't work. 

issue: Arxa: Welcome! Here's a link to Deeplearning4j's Gitter Guidelines, our documentation and other DeepLearning resources online. Please explore these and enjoy! [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: raver119:  [<-ISSUE->] <- Actually never done a pull request before.. First time for everything. Feel free to implement this solution as you see fit. 
solution: 

issue: hello guys im trying to run a convolutional network but im getting this err: Exception in thread "main" org.deeplearning4j.exception.DL4JInvalidConfigException: Invalid configuration for layer (idx=2, name=layer2, type=ConvolutionLayer) for width dimension:  Invalid input configuration for kernel width. Require 0 < kW <= inWidth + 2*padW; got (kW=5, inWidth=1, padW=0)Input type = InputTypeConvolutional(h=30,w=1,d=2), kernel = [5, 5], strides = [1, 1], padding = [0, 0], layer size (output depth) = 2, convolution mode = Truncate, can someone help me please ? 
solution: 

issue: Guiull: yes, the answer is simple: you have 30x1 input to one of your layers, with a 5x5 kernel (with 0 padding)clearly, you can't apply a kernel of size 5 to activations of width 1 well, that said, it should noton averagedepend on batch sizeand itshoulddepend on TBPTT length, as it\'s the average score for each iterationnot sure what you mean "doesn\'t seem to have much to do with my loss functions" and that isexactlywhat it is 
solution: I mean it's not interpretable like the MAE or the MSE functions are. As in, average error per example.. 

issue: AlexDBlack: I have problems interpretingnet.score(). It varies depending on batchSize and tbptt length and doesn't seem to have much to do with my loss functions (MSE/MAE) 
solution: 

issue: hi all.  Shouldn't  the SimpleCNN ( [<-LINK->] ) from model zoo end with an OutputLayer? How can it be trained without outputlayer? trying to train, I get [error] (run-main-0) org.deeplearning4j.exception.DL4JException: Cannot calculate gradient and score with respect to labels: final layer is not an IOutputLayer[error] org.deeplearning4j.exception.DL4JException: Cannot calculate gradient and score with respect to labels: final layer is not an IOutputLayer[error]     at org.deeplearning4j.nn.multilayer.MultiLayerNetwork.computeGradientAndScore(MultiLayerNetwork.java:2242) 
solution: 

issue: it tells you right there, but why are you even trying to build from source? so because you want to use something that isn't released yet? 
solution: In that case you should follow the guide for building locally.  [<-LINK->]. there are no short cuts. 

issue: Is there any particular reason why this is a hard requirement that can't be overridden in BaseOutputLayer? I'm somewhat new to ML so I'm curious..What if I have a custom loss function that doesn't need this requirement?Labels array numColumns (size(1) = 1) does not match output layer number of outputs (nOut = 98) 
solution: 

issue: anybody here using the dl4j + knime integration?  my GPU usage tends to be only around 10-15% for some reason -- is that consistent with what others have observed who have used it? 
solution: edgimar: It's possible to get that for many reasons.  Too much data transfer, too little data, network too small, or too large.  And that's before whatever overhead knime causes.. 

issue: hi, guys. Can someone explain how to load a model that consists of tf-idf vectorizer and bunch of dense layers? I'm especially interested in loading trained tf-idf to dl4j. Thanks. chrisvnicholson: If I'm not mistaken ModelSerializer can load only the model trained with dl4j. Is there any way to load python sklearn model for example? There are examples of loading keras models. But I can't save trained keras tfidf so I use tfidf  trained with sklearn. Is there any way to load it in dl4j? chrisvnicholson: got it. by the way what is supportable format for WordVectorSerializer.loadTxt? 
solution: 

issue: chrisvnicholson: Thank you for introducing YOLO. When I checked it, it was different from what I wanted. I am looking for models estimating exact area (pixel level  segmentation).  Do you have some models to introduce? I have a trained CNN (10.zip). If I want to train the CNN 10 epochs more, is this the right way?MultiLayerNetwork DLModel = ModelSerializer.restoreMultiLayerNetwork("10.zip");for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {    model.fit(TrainDataIter);} 
solution: 

issue: I would like to ask how to properly create MapSchedule. [<-LINK->] This resulted in Invalid set of values: must contain initial value (position 0). Does that mean that there must be first value with key 0? Also If I am defining it in map should I also set learning rate in updater or just lrSchedule? it is 0.9.2-SNAPSHOT 
solution: 

issue: If I run model.fit(DataSetIterator), does it go through the DataSet list 1 time, running each mini batch for the number of configurations specified in the configuration, or does it go through the DataSet list for the number of iterations, fitting each mini batch 1 time per pass? then is there a confi to loop a numbe of epochs, or do I just need to do that loop myself? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: even if my database is a .csv file ? Because im having difficulties to build my convolutional network with a .csv database instead of images, thanks for the answer 
solution: 

issue: add some details please what exactly you're testing and what's the difference you're getting atm your question has no sense, due to adam's answer: imagerecordreader uses nativeimageloader so their output has to be the same 
solution: 

issue: kaonick: post code you are using in a !gist kaonick: thanks, but we also need to see how you are creating the ImageRecordReader kaonick: I can't see any obvious problems there, though are you sure it's loading the exact same file?I mean we use .asMatrix(File) internally anyway... [<-LINK->]

solution: 

issue: raver119: thanks for the pointer for doc re: workspaces. I've used it successfully in our SequentialTrainer mode and it really helps, time for processing is constant, as well as memory. Question though, when using ParallelWrapper, where is the call for  notifyScopeLeft()?  ( I see that async dataset iterator calls notifyScopeEntered [<-LINK->] , but I can't find a matching notifyScopeLeft in the latest DL4J code base). 
solution: 

issue: when will the version 0.9.3 be pulished? when will the version 0.9.2 be pulished? 
solution: jerry-sjtu: we're not giving promises on releases, but i think it'll be out pretty soon.. well, tbh next release will be way more then just keras2 import. 

issue: horschi: it just means that you have conflicting versions of MKL on your system, set java.library.path to the empty string to work around that 
solution: 

issue: hi is there a way for executing deeplearning4j algos in parallel way not using spark  (i have my custom distributed java computing service) 
solution: 

issue: publicocean0: they are executed in parallel anyway 
solution: 

issue: oof it worked, im not sure why i didnt try it before for some reason it only downloaded one dll out of the four, deleting it made it redownload all ive been trying to troubleshoot this the entire day, thanks :) 
solution: 

issue: Tetragonal: how's your nvidia-smi looking? the compiler giving back a version doesn't mean your cuda install works the driver needs to work the compiler and the driver are very different things publicocean0: it kinda sorta could work? you would need a networking layer...I'm not sure how that would play out with the parameter server you would have to mimic what we do in spark 
solution: 

issue: When I am using in 0.9.1 and it is using CUDA [<-CODE->] does that mean it is using CuDNN? It is also using CudnnHelpers. 
solution: And I dont have any idea what changed. 

issue: I am getting different results on same parameters in different versions. I have in my mind, that Alex did some fix with FrozenLayers. Couldnt that be cause? I created issue earlier this day :) 
solution: 

issue: I'm editing the MnistImagePipeline example to work with other images. If I choose to work with color images, my input layer size would be heightwidthchannels, instead of just height * width? h times w times channels 
solution: for fully connected layers - yes. they have different expected input dimensionality. 

issue: liashchynskyi: might be something fixed in 0.2.20, so please make sure to try it: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Looks like the examples are running, just the AnimalClassification  is acting up a bit? 
solution: 

issue: liashchynskyi: to double check you added it correctly: can you give us amvn dependency:tree(run on command line) in a gist? 
solution: 

issue: I got 0.8 with 4500 images/62 classes, is it plausible to get 0.9 with 40k/43? for precision 
solution: for images, that's one example. 

issue: last question for today, I saw an example which could separate 90% of data for training and 10% for testing, could you point me to the name of it?

issue: How to transfer a INDArray{shape=[1,3,224,224]} to BufferImage? I used the ImageLoad.toImage() and got the error:java.lang.IllegalStateException: Rank is 4 rows() call is not valid 
solution: 

issue: Not sure this is the right channel for this, but I noticed the info at [<-LINK->] says the required cmake version is 3.2 where it should be >=3.8 
solution: 

issue: johanvos: mind filing an issue? more context would help there thanks! done with your quantum stuff? :D 
solution: for now, yes :) I'll file an issue.. well actually, i plan to have a deeper look at ND4J for doing quantum computing as well, but that's a different story.. 

issue: AlexDBlack: I am not sure if notification from github is send when mentioned but I commented issue [<-ISSUE->] where I answered your question. 
solution: 

issue: I took a look at the corpus you are trying to use@Audhil, it is pretty anemic by deep learning standards,  so your word vectors on it will be pretty bad - and using pretrained word vectors will not work either because you can't load them on even the current flag ship phones 
solution: Audhil: Must agree with raver. Without proper knowledge you will have repeatedly a lot of problems.. just to get better ideas, current state and tricks of nlp. 

issue: I have 121 classes with 100 images each which I split 80-20 in training/testing data. The MultiLayerConfiguration I use is similar to the one used in the LenetMnistExample. The last score that was printed by the ScoreIterationListener was 1.8432050547657357E-5 at iteration 123530. I am still in the middle of getting used to and understanding dl4j. I know that only one epoch is not useful but I just wanted to generate some kind of result to go from there. And because I was kind of surprised about the number of iterations I wanted to ask you guys if I am doing something wrong I have to attend a meeting now but I will send you my code in an hour or so Here is the code for the classifier: [<-LINK->] And the code for the image pipeline: [<-LINK->] 
solution: Yeah, I think so, too. But as I mentioned earlier, this kind of my first try. Images will probably be scaled down and I will probably add more layers, too. But my question is at what iteration (output of the ScoreIterationListener) the one training epoch I am running would be done.. 

issue: deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j#4287Thanks a lot, guys This is probably a problem in my CPU.

I'm interested in yolo, someday I'll compile myself. 
solution: 

issue: Pinging@dionisole. Can't tell if you're still in the room -- my CLI is acting up.  There are a few reasons for NaN while training.  Usually it's a numerical operation like an infinity or a division by zero. I tend to run into them with eReLU or Sigmoid when e^x get a really big value of x. The best thing you can do is check your learning rate and see if it's too big. 
solution: 

issue: Oh i guess i either have to raise the parameter number of l2 regulariazation or place this gradient clipping (which i dont know how to set it  ) WHat do you suggest to implement though? Thanks for the link now i undertand what clipping is. I dont know how to say it but i dont know how to use snapshots or even know the my current snapshot i tried to build from source as there is was an error with now luck. no* 
solution: 

issue: actually, dense -> conv can't add the preprocessors automatically it's a very unusual configuration though conv -> dense is very common + well supported, by comparison do you have a good reason to do that?conv assumes a spatial relationship between the inputs, but that clearly doesn't hold with the output of a dense layer 
solution: 

issue: Unfortunately, going through all the nd4j code is way out of my scope, though I tried. In the end, it was easier for me to write a custom DataSetIterator tailored to my needs. 
solution: 

issue: Hello everyone. I've managed to get a pretty basic training algorithm up and running. I don't get any errors, but after training is complete I get two messages saying that most of my 89 classes were not predicted by the model. Is this a tuning problem, or is there something else afoot? [<-LINK->] I'm fairly certain it's a tuning issue but since this is my first time I wanted to double check with the folks here. 
solution:

solution: 

issue: Use maven We do not support eclipse outside using the m2 plugin 
solution: 

issue: Liujish931: you are looking at about 7.6GB of data just to define your vectors 
solution: if you want the cosine similarity between each pair of them you will get at least the same amount of data as a result, so if you have less than 16GB of GPU RAM available, you already have a problem. 

issue: treo: i have wrapped the vectors in sparse forms reduced to about 3g and for each call nd4j op  transform them back but i will look in detail ^^ yes i normalized i get somehow maybe i dont have enough op in parallel 
solution: so one op like mul() we dont use parallelisation ?. 

issue: i am trying  to build  deeplearning4j-examples,  so as to get jar and start coding by my own using those jars. now issue is facing difficulties to build code. i am not getting what to do... 
solution: 

issue: getting an run time exception  java.lang.RuntimeException: No CUDA devices were found in system. what shoud i do to resolve this exceptiom. i am traying to run classification example given in dl4j-examples... agibsonccc: OK but my system do not have cuda device... i am new to dl4j how to resolve this error? 
solution: 

issue: in dl/ml such "design guidance" is approx 70% of work rest is etl and tuning. 
solution: If you come back with something less vague we can make some recommendations. you have to wrap your head around the approach you want to take though. 

issue: I am using a desktop and use cudnn. the error is in [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: I have another question (hopefully concrete enought):OutputLayer is in fact a dense layer (and this time I double checked it in the code), while LossLayer just applies an activation function on the input.RnnOutputLayer is also dense (on each time step). Is there also something like an RnnLossLayer? Or can I use an RnnToFeedForwardPreProcessor for that purpose? yeah, I will try a bit and either fill an issue or directly a pull request. I am already digging all the time in the dl4j source code btw: I am using intellij, included dl4j via maven and downloaded the sources. From time to time I get a message, that the sources do not match the byte code. Not sure if the problem is just here or some more general 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: i tired to find out on google but getting only time series examples. 
solution: 

issue: One question, my score is moving around 1e-2 for like 12K iteration and my avgF1 is somewhere around 65%. I wanted to add dropout but I don't know if score is height and I should try to finetune lr or because I have just 5 classes it will be like that and I should apply regularization (Dropout in my case). Also is it possible to set statStorageListener to start from iteration 5k for example? After cca 6k iterations score is so low that on graph scale it is not much moving 
solution: 

issue: papperwing: actually, you can make the stats listener start late, simply setmodel.setListenerswhen you want it to start ghisvail: as far as I know there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to use it on ubuntu 
solution: ghisvail: i think it should work fine, as i know we have at least 1 dev that uses ubuntu these days, and i hadn't heard any complaints. 

issue: getting this error while running a classifier " Cannot convert sequence writables to one-hot: class index 3 >= numClass (3)" raver119: recordReader.initialize(new FileSplit(new ClassPathResource("data1.csv").getFile())); see

issue: Hey there. I am getting a lot of Nans even with small learning rate 0.08 What i can do?? to stop gettin Nans? 
solution: that depends on why you're getting them. At the begining i get some normal values and suddenly only Nans. And the fact is that i didnt change any important setting, only the learning rate... 

issue: agibsonccc: @raver119I activated ND4J_DEBUG env variable to true and reran the program and had the following error. But, I found a strange thing. My GPU has  8G memory and my program used close to 8G memory to run. After running my program for a while (the computer was locked automatically). I typed my password word to unlock the computer. However, the monitor showed a black screen for seconds (like frozen screen) and finally showed my program . It seems that the program created the error whenever I tried to unlock the computer to check the status. I attached the error message. [<-LINK->] .  The next one is the original error message that I asked this morning. [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: INDArray.std() gives wrong results, is this known? 
solution: Tschigger: so you're wrong there. you can 2 bias corrected standard deviations or not. Tschigger:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: slang03: yes, if should fall back on the CPU when a GPU isn't found, but there's a bug in 0.9.1 so it doesn't happen :( It\'s still possible to call something likeSystem.getenv().put("BACKEND_PRIORITY_GPU", "-1")at runtime on machineswithoutGPU and it won\'t try to load the GPU backend It's not setting the environment variable, just the HashMap copy. That's what ND4J looks at. 
solution: 

issue: salihbout: you can use this: [<-LINK->] basically, each Pair<INDArray,INDArray> in a list (well, iterable technically) is the features + labels respectively so each INDArray in your list is onetime step(say, a row vector) not one sequence? 
solution: That\'s the point@AlexDBlack, Sorry I misunderstood the "sequence " meaning ! you are right ! each INDArray is one step in the feed-forward process. 

issue: Hello. I was getting Nans for a strange reason and  i tried to use gradient normalization and didnt helped though Note that i allrerady used regularaization.lw l2* and i also normalize data with NormalizerStandarize What do you sugest me to do? AlexDBlack: Done 11:25:01.603 java[3428:65683] IMKInputSession presentFunctionRowItemTextInputViewWithEndpoint:completionHandler: I get this error when i deploy UI Is it related to something specific? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, i am (navely) trying to debug/inspect my convolutional network by rendering the activations of the net to a Swing panel.  I notice two things that puzzle me, i hope you could enlighten me: 1) The image is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise, and 2) All images are black and white (even though i have specified 3 channels throughout my config. 
solution: 

issue: @prangeyes, the rank of the activation matrix is 12,3,300,300 (minibatch, channels, width,heigth)DL4J uses NCHW format - i.e., height before width 
solution: 

issue: upsampling images, you mean? yes... ish?I mean there's the image transforms, and ImageRecordReader will scale an image up if required... 
solution: I thought something like I have  3 images from class 1 and one image in class 2 and I would like to add noise to that image of class 2 to have also three images. 

issue: General question do training batch and testing batch have to be the same i mean do they have to have any correlation on sizes? 
solution: But if you use batch normalization, there might be a problem if the minibatch size is 1.. I indeed use minibatch normalization but sizes are 6000 on training and 300 on testing. 

issue: Hello. I am trying to make use of the SKIL server and zeppelin notebook to develop DL4J models. Working well in java, but when I port an example to scala for a SKIL experiment something silently fails. In this port of the ParagraphVectorsClassifierExample everything runs fine until line 100 where unClassifiedIterator finds 0 documents. The other iterator works fine, the documents are there and I get no errors. 1) Is this the right approach for using the SKIL server? 2) Should I be using remote debugging to figure out why it doesn't work?https://gist.github.com/tgreiser/d91db7553cfd3122fd4b342710416f29 
solution: 

issue: Is there a way to update the learning rate according to the error produced?

solution: 

issue: any ideas why cuda exceptions happen in the dl4j-examples (win 10, cuda 8) ? things like "CUDA stream synchronization failed" running on a 1080 ti 
solution: 

issue: what version of cuda are you running? did you check nvidia-smi? 
solution: as long as you can interact with your gpu and see the memory I don't care what tool you use :D. it might be a weird windows/cuda thing too. 

issue: my first guess would be java xmx settings it should run fine on Windows 
solution: 

issue: I am sorry for that. I am new for dl4j. I just want to get help to solve my question.  I don't question dl4j. Apologize again for my inappropriate question@agibsonccc 
solution: 

issue: I've run that example a million times in the past with cuda 8 on windows 10, without issue... GTX970 and Titan X (pascal) 
solution: jvence: if you want to predict x steps ahead, then you'd have a CSV with two columnsfirst one: features (current values). second column: labels (N steps ahead). 

issue: you might be waiting a while... cloning dl4j examples at a grand 20 KB/s currently (on a 2.5MB/s connection) :/ 
solution: :). 

issue: treo: please enable ND4J_DEBUG so, it's not kernel crash ok that helps. another weird idea: what happens if you disable workspaces? :) 
solution: 

issue: Hi, when I compile the master with cuda, do I need cuda 8 or cuda 9?

solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: @raver120congrats for the book! raver120: right I was confusing with@raver119:D 
solution: I wish GAI was that easy, so i could understand you :). 

issue: Hy,Can someone tell me which is more efficient memory - management and execution - time wise?Let's assume it takes exactly the same work and time to process the files into the necessary formats.So, is loading a CSV file with RecordReaderDataSetIterator and feeding it into a model or loading a DataSet file (it was previously saved such) and then feeding it into the network? 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: thank you for your answer.Do you have an idea why a CNN is using a lot of RAM when theDataSetobject is loaded from file, but it seems to use less when loaded withRecordReaderDataSetIterator. Can you give me suggestion on what I should explore?

issue: Hello, i have built an LSTM network. Is there any way to improve my network with new data? 
solution: 

issue: Hello folks,  just curious, has anyone tested out DL4J using the Amazon GPU instances?  any thoughts/comments on compatability ? thanks@raver119... i'll see what they support and report back on how it goes. fantastic.. i'm just looking at the p3 / p2 / p1 instances .. 
solution: so that\'ll probably be a bit easier for "out of the box" support... 

issue: This may be a very stupid idea, but when looking at OpenBLAS and how it would work on iOS, I wondered if the Apple BLAS (on iOS that is) would be a solution that could work with nd4j

solution: 

issue: akamlani: is this 0.9.1 or master? dl4j version, that is 
solution: AlexDBlack: may be just on edge, as I pulled it over the weekend.  Probably doesn’t have that fix.. 

issue: Hi, I am learning and I have a modified example that I have been running for a while very successfully and lately hangs / stop responding. Please what is the best way to get some help? 
solution: 

issue: there's no special guide for intellij it supposed to "just work" i.e. you import examples project as maven project, and you're done 
solution: 

issue: Hi,  is there a quick way i can do a sort of a matrix along a dimension, instead of returning sorted values ,  it returns indices for the sorted values (I found there are argmax , but i want all the sorted indices not only the first one) 
solution: ugh, ye, that one still pending optimization.... 

issue: Hi guys. I'm coming back with an issue that I mentioned a few days ago: LossLayer doesn't work for Sequences (i.e. for Recurrent Networks). As mentioned before, I am now just writing my own Layer. Right now for our current task, but I'm having a future pull request in mind. Is here the right place to discuss some internal implementation questions? raver119: OK, I will do so. Though my questions are more about coding style, project structure. Getting the things somehow done is doable. At the moment, I am mostly focused on our current problem. Later, when lifting my code the dl4j, I will start with an pull request and start a discussion, there. 
solution: I will do so, thanks. For the moment, I will first just get it running in our project. There is enough time to change this, later on and commit it to DL4J. 

issue: Hello, i have built an LSTM network. Is there any way to improve my network with new data? 
solution: 

issue: kornkreismuster: so in general..I wouldn\'t recommend against this "gradual training" idea it never works in practice an dit's significantly harder to deploy pile up your data as raver said MatthiasDM: yes..I'm not sure what would stop you? I mean..if you decompose a neural net down to its basics (if you can't do that I suggest our !book) minibatch training works fine if you load your net and run it against new data 
solution: 

issue: hi, all, i run dl4j on spark  and got an error: java.lang.AbstractMethodError: org.deeplearning4j.spark.api.worker.ExecuteWorkerPathFlatMap.call(Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/util/Iterator,  my spark version is 2.0.1, dl4j version is 0.9.1, can anybody help me with this? solved, i replaced datavec-spark_2.11-0.9.1_spark_1 and dl4j-spark_2.11-0.9.1_spark_1 with datavec-spark_2.11-0.9.1_spark_2 and dl4j-spark_2.11-0.9.1_spark_2, and it works~ 
solution: 

issue: I'm trying to understand the batchSize from the RecordReaderDataSetIterator. I created a small training CSV with 54 entries and use this also for testing (to try and reproduce close to 100% accuracy). If I set the batch size to 54, I get 96.3% accuracy and when I try with 27 batch size this drops to 59.2% accuracy Any idea what I might be doing wrong? I presume that if the batchSize is 54, then all is loaded into memory. When the batchSize is 27 then half will be loaded into memory at a time 
solution: 

issue: Question on org.deeplearning4j.models.sequencevectors.SequenceVectors#fit(). The javadoc states "starts training over" but when I look inside the method, I see that it is checking for existingModel and stuff and does other things that look like as if fit() method continues fitting instead of starting it over.So, is fit() actually continuing fitting if there is an existing model? 
solution: 

issue: legoly: No. With all activations zero into the softmax you should get equivalent probabilities at the output. 
solution: 

issue: does somebody knows where i can find an example app who uses deeplearning 4js in android? in android yes 
solution: 

issue: So in general should we always copy pom.xml from dl4j-examples even if we're starting a fresh project? 
solution: cool, as i’ve said that issue meant to be fixed now. 

issue: raver119: disabling the parallel tokenization seems to have done the trick, I didn't run into deadlocks anymore. Thanks again! 
solution: 

issue: saidaspen: please don't try to guess the error cause just give us a full stack trace as a !gist please 
solution: 

issue: So we should not use DatasetIterator for regression? What is the alternative? 
solution: That is awidehop you just reached :D. You can use it for regression fine.

solution: 

issue: dawelton: that looks very much like a bug then, can you please file an !issue, if possible with a minimal example for reproducing the wrong behavior? yes, master 
solution: 

issue: treo: May I ask some more questions about the dl4j code? I'm getting a lot of errors here in the code. 
solution: If you are using intellij you might want to install the lombok plugin. 

issue: madhumathew: does it run with one epoch?  does it hang a second time at 10 epochs if you try again? 
solution: 

issue: When 0.9.2 release? in this year? wait it to use yolo2 
solution: 

issue: We do not give estimates SidneyLann: you can build from source then if you want it that badly We want you to use yolo2 as well but sadly we have tensorflow and onnx import to get in to reasonable shape first this is going to be a massive release on top of being a 1.0 you can't expect us to hurry itjustfor yolo 
solution: that will take some planning without destroying things for people. 

issue: I have been trying the whole day just to get the setup ready for wordtovec using this tutorial [<-LINK->] and all I get is "ERROR org.nd4j.versioncheck.VersionCheck - Found incompatible/obsolete library Canova on classpath.

issue: seems to me like 8gb of ram is not enough to train the google news data for wored to vector in dl4j. I am using ubuntu 16.04 and I tried changing the heap size in eclipse. Yet it says that ram juice got finished in middle of the traning. Is there anyway I could get the word2vec converted vector file of google news? AlexDBlack: Yep, I tried to do what was said on the memory guide. Now it is taking longer to throw the error but eventually it did. 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: @agibsonccc, hi, guys, i create a gist describing my problem, please help, thanks a lot~,gist url is: [<-LINK->] ok, i'll add those information agibsonccc: ,hi, i updated my gist( [<-LINK->] ), see if information is enough for now please, thanks~ 
solution: "Dl4j" is actually a whole set of libraries for ETL, reinforcement learning, tensor operations, deep learning dsl,... 

issue: ok, will try that, and generally what is the proper number of executors and cores? my dataset has about 2million examples 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: The reason I came here is that I will be the person to convert Lua code into something else. This code will be then integrated by the engineer. Since I really do not want to learn TF and its messy way of doing simple things, I need to understand if deeplearning4j has the necessary tools and I won't be forced to reinvent a wheel or doing something from scratch. no, we need this model to run as a service the ocr engine generates xml which is then transformed into a series strings and these strings are fed into the model which generates a prediction not that I can't look it up but does deeplearning4j support various optimizers like adam / adagrad / adadelta etc. out-of-the-box? pytorch like api? Does it mean that pytorch models could be used as well? 
solution: 

issue: Goot time folks. Can I ask someone about project building process with maven?

solution: 

issue:  [<-ISSUE->] this problem is solved? i have the error,but i used the master branch 
solution: i used keras1.2.  both model .save() and model.save_model is not defined. well, file an !issue then, and@maxpumperlawill take a look there. 

issue: Small question, I can't seem to find anywhere which layers are supported by GPU's? Only LSTM & Convolutional layers it seems? Why aren't DenseLayers for example supported? More specific, cuDNN. 
solution: 

issue: What is the nd4j syntax for the following numpy code: A[0:10,0:10] = np.ones((10,10)). I can't quite figure it out from the documentation 
solution: 

issue: raver119: some time ago you mentioned that if I did make my threadripper build you wanted me to run some tests for you... do you still want me to do that? 
solution: are you able to build libnd4j from sources?. i could prepare those right there for you. 

issue: as far as I know you can change the mode they work in 
solution: and it's possible to disable one of packages. but i want to see real numbers nanos/micros.

solution: 

issue: Hi guys! Is it possible to run Word2Vec Models (Paragraph Vectors) on GPU? I was trying it with the ParagraphVectorsClassifierExample.java you provide, but I get an error. 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: One more question: I read that there is a problem with maven 3.5.2 and nd4j - so I better install an older maven version? OK, I guess I am really too stupid for building dl4j locally (or my computer just hates me ;-) ) 
solution: 

issue: Sorry again: suppose we have the following function public INDArray getWordVector(String word){float[] buffer = new float[model.getDim()];List vector = model.getVector(word);for(int i = 0;i < model.getDim() ;i++){buffer[i] = vector.get(i);}return Nd4j.create(buffer);} suppose the buffer array resulting is: -0.0014587658224627376, -0.0013949136482551694, -0.006120333913713694, ... then when we call Nd4j.create(buffer); the resulting vector contains the above values but rounded e.g -0.00, -0.00, -0.01 ... So any suggestion to solve this blocked simple issue :) from yesterday 
solution: 

issue: raver119: Ah, of course. Thanks. Would you use the gpu backend on tasks like these? My vectors have 1000 dims..

issue: Is getting SNAPSHOTS working again Is getting SNAPSHOTs working again ( [<-LINK->] ) or moving version 0.9.2 to Maven likely to happen any time soon? In December? I know that no promises can be made on things like this, but is it even a priority? I ask because there seem to be many fixes in 0.9.2 that I would like to have, but building from master is a nightmare, and also impractical if I want my project to work on different platforms

solution: 

issue: how do i install BLAS (ATLAS, MKL, or OpenBLAS)? Or do i even need to? The instructions are not very clear on this 
solution: mikoma: ha that's funny, i tried something similar when i was getting started. i found that it was much easier to simply include the dependencies for dl4j in my projects than to try what you're attempting. you can still use nd4j functions that way and don't need to build locally. that SHOULD give you all the functionality you want but if you still want to try to build locally then one of the dl4j guys will have to step in and help, i'm just another user and don't want to steer you in the wrong direction.. 

issue: poweigel: i just realized that the chat on the dl4j and nd4j page is the same. i was actually talking about nd4j because i only need some gpu powered marix calculations in java and not the dl4j package... this link [<-LINK->] lists BLAS (ATLAS, MKL, or OpenBLAS) as prerequisite, but following the link to here [<-LINK->] there is no more info about what i should do next 
solution: 

issue: rangwank: dynamic under/over sampling? not yet (something I want to get to in thefuture though)only thing we have there is [<-LINK->] which is a preprocessing step, essentially poweigel: post full exception in a !gist looks like a standard compiler error, not related to DL4J i.e., the restore method throws an IOException, and it isn't in a try/catch block (and can't be thrown by the enclosing method)  [<-LINK->] they all throw IOExceptions that has nothing to do with your IDE furthermore, it's acompile errornot a runtime errorthat error means your code doesn't compile 
solution: 

issue: Yes, basically I'll need to either a) rewrite Torch model (data transform, network, training and evaluation) into Python framework that is supported by DL4J  b) Reimplement Torch model in DL4J (current poc is pretty simple and won't be a problem since it is a simple GRU/LSTM that uses two input tensors (word tensor, and features tensor). The two input tensors are summed before going into GRU/LSTM. The output layer consists of Linear -> Sigmoid [0,1] and uses BCE loss function. I'd rather do b) since rewriting it into PyTorch and then connecting via DL4J  would be too time consuming I suspect

issue: agibsonccc: thanks for the info.  I hope I'll be ok with it as I've had some very basic knowledge from my masters course and a year of messing around with DL4j, however I think it'll be of immense benefit because I currently know just enough to make a network that does something, but it's kind of a bodge job and I'm just tuning and settings things up by trial and error or luck lol.  A better understanding of the underlying principles will allow me to make better choices and achieve better results you guys have a coursera course??

solution: cool :). 

issue: Hi! I have a nooby question. I would like to load up a pretrained model (say vgg16) on CIFAR10), then immediately test its performance on an Image i have on hand (no tuning) as a test. I have loaded up a pretrained model as shown on [<-LINK->] , but I don't know how to see what input dimensions it expects, or how to perform the inference on a single INDArray. I might figured out the second half of my question. Needed to cast my model as a computation graph 
solution: 

issue: I understand that word2Vec works only for word. But when I send a sentence to the word2Vec, why does it gives me the vectors? I was hoping that it works only for words? Actually, I was trying to see similarity between the sentences. Just for the experiment on how word2vec works, i passed two sentences "He is the man" and "the man is He" and it gives me the exact same vectors. What is going on? I have not tokenized the sentence and am passing the sentence as a whole. Does this mean that it works at sentence level as well using the word2vec only? Seeking opinions 
solution: 

issue: Hi, does theAsyncDataSetIteratorhave some restrictions in which cases it has no benefit? I just ran the Word2VecSentimentRNN example from [<-LINK->] once with the normal DataSetIterator and once with the iterator wrapped innew AsyncDataSetIterator(source, 4)to fetch 4 batches asynchronously at a time. Though both setups ran for 1:40 minutes per epoch. For 1) yes, but thats not the case here. For 2) why is that? Parallelizing data loading should benefit a network that is fast in training since the network does not have to wait for the batches as long as with a sequential iterator Sure that happens for prefetch size = 1, though using prefetch size = 4 e.g. would load 4 batches in 10 sec that makes 14 seconds for 4 batches while using normal iterator it would take 44 secs 
solution: 

issue: raver119: ，hi，is there any progress with issue [<-ISSUE->] ( [<-ISSUE->] ), i encountered the same problem. sorry, wrong issue number, issue url is [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: it looks like it's just oom, caused by 2 things: mixing workspaces modes. you're running out of memory something within your code, and once workspace tries to allocate ram for its needs - there's nothing left on device, since there's only 3gb memory in total. 

issue: @clavvisWith my data I tried pretraining, backpropagation and again pretraining.well, yeah - don't do that then?pretraining trains both the encoder and decoder (sub-) layers in the VAEbackprop modifies only the encoderconsequently, the decoder is getting activations unlike the ones it has seen previously in short: don't do pretraining after backprop... 
solution: 

issue: Got some weird thing going on. I'm able to run my code on osx, but on linux (after building on linux) I get a ND4j error,ND4J is probably missing dependencies.

solution: 

issue: btw I am really glad that I am getting nice results, but I have feeling that VGGImagePreProcessor is not based on that arxiv mentioned in javadoc Because fit method is not implemented there and based on that paper it must be fitted on dataset that is based on first few lines in section 2.1 of mentioned arxiv ( [<-LINK->] ) and code is taken from 0.9.1

issue: AlexDBlack: I guess, we have different working times (greetings from the other side of the earth). The more thanks for your replies and help. If odd input masks should be supported, I will try to consider such cases in my pull request 
solution: you location shows in you profile, so I guessed so. I am utc+1 (Germany).I can think of some boarder cases, like two inputs, but one does only exists for certain cases or classes.

solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: @AlexDBlackI have installed the latest MKL using pip (not anaconda) and I also did a clean install using mvn from the git repository (I am trying to run examples from the orielly book). So everything should be the latest. Still get the error Intel MKL FATAL ERROR: Cannot load mkl_intel_thread.dll. Checked the path variable - dont see anything specific to MKL.

issue: Hi! I am using a LSTM from DeepLearning4J and I obtain as an output an INDArray like this: [[[   ?,     ?,     ?,     ?,     ?,   [   ?,     ?,     ?,     ?,     ?,     ?,     ?,     ?,     ?,     ?]]]. What does the question mark represent in an INDArray? I am having this problem only when I run the LSTM on a cluster, in my pc and in another two I don't have this problem.. 
solution: I am using an Evolutionary Algorithm to evolve the weights of the network. No training, nothing. Every cycle I change the weights of the network, and check with the same input the result of the LSTM. The set of weights that has the better score (I check the output how is it) wins and goes in the next generation. To semplify lets assume the input is an INDArray of values. Weights are random generated with Nd4j.rand(1, size). Output is another INDarray of values. As I was saying, the evolution works really fine on two different system, in the third one the networks generates NaN. 

issue: I'm having some issues with fine-tuning. I'm trying with EditLastLayerOthersFrozen in dl4jexamples and if I add some l2 regularization to the FineTuneConfiguration, weights of the the frozen layers keep changing at every iteration even if they're not supposed to. This happens only with ComputationGraph and not with MultiLayerNetwork. I'm using 0.9.1

(I downloaded "cudnn-8.0-windows7-x64-v7.zip" and copied three files to the three directories in "C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v8.0."). raver119: I installed the right version now. However, I had the similar error. Do I have to add the cudnn library  using "Project Structure/Modules/Depencences"? 
solution: and verify memory use for your nn manually. 

issue: Hey, I used  INDArrayDataSetIteratorn to generate my DataSetIterator's, but I'd like to add additional futures as inputs in my ComputationGraph with MultiDataSetIterator, is there something like an INDArrayMultiDataSetIterator that I could use because I have not been able to find it.Thank you.

issue: Hey, Whoops that sent too soon. I was wondering if setting pretrain iterations actually does anything. The behavior doesn't seem to make a difference in training times and I had trouble finding any use of it in the source code Just to clarify, I am referring the the method call ".preTrainIterations()" during the construction of a layer on both AutoEncoder and VariationalAutoEncoder

issue: Hi the team! I'm trying time series regression using a seq2seq model. I quickly modified the AdditionRNN example. Apart from the custom iterator which provides the properly formatted MultiDataset with time series data, on the model I only changed the loss function (to MSE) and activation to 'Identity'. I can't get my model to learn anything. My questions are:is it theoretically possible to adapt seq2seq for regression, I can't find much papers on this online\nif yes, any suggestion of config / hyperparameters I could use to get a model which learns?Thanks a lot to any pointers / suggestions )

issue: Hi all! Nd4j is a really amazing library, so huge thanks for making and contributing to it! I was wondering whether it\'s possible to do something in numpy you\'d call boolean or "mask" index arrays? So e.g. a = [1, 2, 3], b = [False, False, True], a[b] = [3]. I went through all of the documentation, issues etc and I couldn\'t find a solution to something that seems quite trivial :( This is my solution so far, however, it\'s quite slow for big arrays: [<-CODE->] I would appreciate any help :)

issue: Hi guys, I am going through the MLPLinearClassifier tutorial and it runs without problems on CPU but when I change pom.xml tond4j-cuda-8.0-platformI am gettingjava.lang.ExceptionInInitializerErrorerror while runningMLPLinearClassifier.java.  What could be the problem? Basically the error saysCaused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: No CUDA devices were found in system But I do have nvidia gpu and it runs on keras ok, I think I know what's the issue it's 8 
solution: 

issue: Ok, now I am gettingCaused by: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /home/pavel/.javacpp/cache/cuda-8.0-6.0-1.3-linux-x86_64.jar/org/bytedeco/javacpp/linux-x86_64/libjnicuda.so: libcudart.so.8.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

solution:  [<-LINK->]. so I guess I have still something build wrong. 

issue: sounds like your logging isn't setup right grayhaired: the only options should be logging. There isn't much room for error there ScoreIterationListener uses slf4j 
solution: Just another question - this might sound too broad/general question - but just asking to get second opinion... if I'm just getting only one of output in Seq2Seq, what could be the problem? It's the one I'm doing is similar to AdditionRNN example.... 

issue: thank you. it output vector is of length of 27 elements.. and output i'm getting is combination of just 4 elements... I'm trying to understand computation graph, and vertex, but it's bit new to me..

issue: Jonty800:  [<-LINK->] look here ^ this is how datasets work dataset objects just use ndarrays underneath 
solution: If I split the dataset using KFoldIterator with 5 folds, does each fold contain all of the classes?. 

issue: Good. i saw it working. Now, usually, if we're apply masking, we put both feature masks and label masks... but as I could see, here I'm getting label masks only as features are of uniform length. So if we're not getting feature masks, is it okay? *we're applying masking 
solution: input masking really only matters for things like bidirectional nets and global pooling anyway.

issue: procton: do you mean transfer learning? wait back up...have you even run a classifier before? I ask because it doesn't seem like you've actually looked in to this much generally when we say "feature extraction" it\'s a different term in DL :D So far what you're describing is pretty vague there\'s no magic "feature extraction" so you\'re telling me you basically skipped studying the basic concepts and just ran the examples and just expect having a vague notion of "feature extraction" will be enough? :D not how it works You really don't have a goal here. It's too vague to be actionable You can do regression, classification, transfer learning to use a pre existing neural net to train a new classifier so look - I'm not going to teach you machine learning my !book does that google search a bit and come back with a real goal your vague notion of "feature extraction" isn\'t going to get you anywhere neural nets aren't magic they aren't like SIFT you need to train them in some form with a goal in mind No I'm not, you're ignoring reality I can't help you if you're ignoring reality Dl4j is a low level library for building custom models that means you have to understand machine learning to use it you can't walk in and ignore the whole field and then expect to use a low level lib like this I asked you one simple question about what you're trying to do and you're complaining.

issue: Read those already, I will start with my new model tomorrow, thanks for the great advise. Little side-question about the VAE talk; are VAE's actually capable of encoding and decoding things like sound? I can't image how any DL model would be able to compress something like that into a smaller fixed-size vector.

I've created an example that I think it might work: [<-LINK->] I don't know if that's right, but it strikes me that with a relatively simple(?) case of trying to classify one number of 20, the probabilities are way off... am I doing something wrong? Also initialization with Xavier doesn't seem to work in this case 
solution: 

issue: Is there any example for  a dynamic input size of a LSTM-NN for classification? Have you tried it with another updater or other init. weights?Not all of them have to be suitable for all problems. 
solution: 

issue: tom-adsfund: here's another example, where I even provide the specific property I'm trying to test for as a 0 or 1, and it essentially completely fails: [<-LINK->] This doesn't seem like what I'd expect whatsoever, so I guess I must be doing something wrong if I remove the weightInit and updater(..) lines I get a sensible result! any idea what was going wrong? Yes, I tried a few, but I eventually decided to let it use the defaults... it would be nice to know why the defaults work, and the others didn't! I just tested it on only one number being labelled as [1,0], and that failed totally. So would be nice to know why inequalities work and equalities don't wellingtonfoz: if it's not available in the package, you can do the same with a BufferedImage? 
solution: 

issue: @agibsonccc thank you!So lets assume I have a label file and lets say I have 5 "rows" in my features data.Do I need a label file like0,0,(...)or can I just put one label in, like0 
solution: 

issue: tom-adsfund: It is not like@agibsonccchas nothing else to do. The small stuff like releasing 1.0 ... 
solution: 

issue: there are cases when non-normalized data works too. or even re-normalized. but general rule of thumb - apply norm. with 10000 iterations? i\'d call that "it overfits", not "works" 
solution: 

issue: what if I'm just generating data in the app? 
solution: 

issue: hmmm... another question, how can I easily make some fake one-hot encoded labels  in NDArray?So to have some randomly generated NDArray:0 0 0 1 00 1 0 0 01 0 0 0 00 1 0 0 0...(in this case, batchsize=4, numOfClasses=5)Init with Nd4j.zeros and then use some for loop to put some random 1 into it? 
solution: ^. 

issue: oh the neural net doesn't change at all? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, public CropImageTransform(java.util.Random random,                          int cropTop,                          int cropLeft,                          int cropBottom,                          int cropRight)i am confused about the 4 last parameters... Should I use the positions of the pixels?! if I use (null,10,10,10,10) is it gonna crop 10 pixels from each side or it is gonna crop a new image with 10 pixels of dimension? AlexDBlack: @raver120could you help me with that? 
solution: Cannot do conversion to one hot using batched reader: 41 output classes, but array.size(1) is 2 (must be equal to 1 or numClasses = 41). 

issue: ParagraphVectors initialization is taking too much time 0.9.1 JDK8 and Native 
solution: 

issue: I'm pretty new to Maven as well as deeplearning4j. What do I need to add to my pom.xml in order to start using the dl4j classes in my code? <dependency><groupId>org.deeplearning4j</groupId><artifactId>deeplearning4j-nlp</artifactId><version>0.9.1</version></dependency> is this the spice if I just want to use word2vec? 
solution: 

issue: awesome, and if I want to use a premade matrix, do you reccomend using that new Model Zoo thing or what's the best way? Also, what's the difference between the backend dependency you sent me and the one I found, just curious. 
solution: two options exists in backend property : using cpu or gpu. The one I sent is cpu. 

issue: any workarounds? I just want to play around with some word2vec pre crawled vectors ok I'm going to give it 5 minutes on these config vm options:-Xms3G -Xmx3G -Dorg.bytedeco.javacpp.maxbytes=8G -Dorg.bytedeco.javacpp.maxphysicalbytes=8G actually, I'll give it a solid 15 minutes since my SSD is only moving at about 4 MB a second in IntelliJ (task manager stats) hooray it worked! thank you! about 6 minutes for me 
solution: 

issue: that's a separate issue here...before you even get started you should try to understand how to feed data in to a neural net :D you can't even take what you were specifying and use it I'm trying to help frame it a bit better for you but I want to understand if what you want to do is even possible Can you answer my question? Your confusion is irrelevant at this point. Let's step back and start from scratch. I'll ask again. What are you trying to do? Forecasting? Classification? Did you actually have a goal in mind? 
solution: 

issue: Exception in thread "main" org.deeplearning4j.exception.DL4JInvalidConfigException: ConvolutionLayer (index=1, name=cnn2) nIn=0, nOut=64; nIn and nOut must be > 0  [<-LINK->] i\'m getting this error: Exception in thread "main" org.deeplearning4j.exception.DL4JInvalidConfigException: ConvolutionLayer (index=1, name=cnn2) nIn=0, nOut=64; nIn and nOut must be > 0 
solution: 

issue: what's not clear here? nIn=0 can't be zero. 
solution: that's ninm for conv layer it is number of channels. i know it cant be zero, but take a look at my file. 

issue: i dont know how to explain.... i am running on default values of eclipse...just wrote the application and pressed run so it takes 100% of memory and 10 minutes later... i got the error 
solution: 

issue: Hi, is there any way of combining columns using datavec? I have a csv file with separate columns for year, month, day etc that I'd like to combine in to a single datatime column. Kind of the opposite of DeriveColumnsFromTimeTransform. 
solution: 

issue: is there any open data source to work on recommendation system for fashion ? 
solution: 

issue: Quick question about my graphics card (from my University PC) - I can see in dxdiag that it has 8GB shared memory and 1GB of VRAM. Does this mean that my graphics card has 1GB of RAM and is not suitable for deep learning? 
solution: 

issue: Calling .init() on a neural net loaded with the ModelSerializer will reset all the weights and stuff right? 
solution: BobChuckyJoe: not sure tbh, there's internal flag to aboid double initialization, but i'm not sure if it's used during deserialization. 

issue: hmm. sounds like you are using sentenceIterator for handling the document level stuff? So that's not far from what I did with my iterator... I was working from [<-LINK->] (because classification was the focus) 
solution: 

issue: is there any way to see the scores of each iteration while using  myMultipleEpochsIterator.fit()? i know how to use with earlystop but not with multipleepochs 
solution: 

issue: Hi All, when i use .setInputTypes(InputType.recurrent(2), InputType.feedForward(15)) while configuring Computation graph, I am getting "Cannot merge vertex of diff types" error  [<-LINK->] @AlexDBlack I am trying to build a architecture which accepts both sequence and non sequential data to make predictions 
solution: 

issue: 1024 x 1024??? that'll takesometime and some ram. and no, 1gb ram isn't even close maybe 64... not sure you can calculate memory requirements for each convolution layer pretty easily 
solution: 

issue: why not have defaults as variables that can be overwritten with setters after instantiation? (I'm going to expect to be told the obvious reason I'm wrong!) 
solution: tom-adsfund: you have just invented the builder pattern, but with more overhead. a.create().foo(1).bar(2).baz(3)vsSometype a = new Sometype(); a.setFoo(1); a.setBar(2); a.setBaz(3);. 

issue: if you become part of a standard java module you'll be dragged through to improve every speck of your design, so I'm not worried now! 
solution: that's because they make money of it. 

issue: AlexDBlack: I've actually managed to find my original proposal for a different datavec api, sitting around since 22 October 2016, I've added it to the github of the stalled implementation: [<-LINK->] @agibsonccc executive summary of it for you: [<-CODE->] 
solution: they aren't directly connected to the pipeline, until the last step. 

issue: Hey guys, happy new year! I have a questions regarding interpretation of the output from the VAE, more specifically i wonder howreconstructionLogProbabilityrelates to thereconstruction probability(i)mentioned in the paper "Variational Autoencoder based Anomaly Detectionusing Reconstruction Probability". I jumped to the conclusion that they should be roughly the same, but the output from the VAE gives me (for example) values between -100k and 450, and i would expect a value in the range [0,1] 
solution: treo: for what its worth, i totally agree on your views regarding datavec, and i hope you can bring your ideas forward. I started playing around the same idea just to simplify the ingestion of data into the nets, but a gave up on a general approach since i have grokked the internals og ND4J.. 

issue: agibsonccc: I filed an issue where i tried to describe mye thoughts. I hope it is useful. I added the asserts from the test to the VAE examples, and it all checked out. The P is just veeeery very tiny(9.062578487754893E-85). Now i have to check why my own VAE doesn't work 
solution: 

issue: I'm struggling on making a MultiLayerNetwork then :C Already cloned I'm struggling to find the right example in this case MultiLayerConfiguration conf = new NeuralNetConfiguration.Builder() This is the part that doesn't work for me 
solution: I get it. So you need that list() part in order to have a MultiLayerConfiguration. 

issue: I'm getting a dimension error with my model imported from Keras.. wondering if I'm creating the input array wrong or something. When I step layer by layer it gets through the embedding ok but then the convolution says it expects a 3 dimensional input (embedding output is 2 dimensions). Any help is appreciated! [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Hi, ParallelWrapper doesn't exist in 0.91 anymore? 
solution:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: raver119: if you're still around would mind taking a quick look at this: [<-LINK->] I think I must be doing something simple wrong... I'm getting this dimensionality error on my constitutional layer 
solution: 

issue: raver119: : do I need to trigger the shutdown of org.nd4j.linalg.memory.provider.BasicWorkspaceManager.WorkspaceDeallocatorThread ? I could image it's not terminating properly and causing the maven exec issue I mentioned above yes, it is see it in the code, daemonic = true 
solution: 

issue: nd4j seems to hang on " - waiting on <0x000000076ae0c198> (a org.nd4j.linalg.memory.provider.BasicWorkspaceManager$WorkspaceDeallocatorThread)" in the workspace deallocator (as visible in the thread dump by jvisualvm in jdk 8). are there any known issues / do I need to invoke shutdown manually? I use nd4j-native-platform 0.9.1 however, this seems to only be an issue when run via the exec maven plugin 
solution: 

issue: ok, I'm back... I can reproduce the 'hang' on macOS and ubuntu 17.04 ... I created a repo on github ... just clone it and execute './run.sh' to see ... [<-LINK->] if it does NOT hang on your machine I am damned :-P it might be something darn stupid, I just can't see it 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I\'m trying to train word2vec on a server equipped with multiple GPUs and I got this error "Multi-GPU word2vec/doc2vec isn\'t available atm". Is there a walk-around for this problem? Um.. was wondering if using GPU could accelerate the training process. But alright, got it, thanks alot! :D true story, thanks! 
solution: 

issue: Please do not post full stack traces like that in the channel I know you're in china so you can't  use gist No I saw what it was Can you post your pom using pastebin please? oh great thanks you're..not using snapshots my friend  [<-CODE->]  [<-LINK->] line 83 you can't use platform with snapshots use just nd4j-cuda-8.0 maven automatically picks up your OS 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] AlexDBlack: I have try according to the link, but I still can't solve my problem 
solution: 

issue: side note. i'm quite surpised: 10 minutes since discussion started, and nobody mentioned emacs. my faith in humanity grows now 
solution: 

issue: Unfortunately, i'm just a bot and can't get beyond that yet to answer you :( 
solution: 

issue: link to file issue@raver120 issue@raver120 
solution: 

issue: Just filled an issue [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: hi, is there a way to track the Word2Vec model training using the UI? I see that the standard examples for UI event listening are not applicable as Word2Vec does not have the same API as the other listeners. 
solution: 

issue: while training I encountered an errorException in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: occurrences cannot be negative: -408944what does it mean thnks 
solution: 

issue: Every diagram I find everywhere is cut down to just show an aspect... nobody seems to actually draw a full diagram. I actually have a series of questions, this one is just covering the initial assumption I want to build on.  I think you are agreeing with my assertion that the blue dot is really multiple nerons? (I'm not embarking on a criticism of the diagram by the way) 
solution: 

issue: All my data is between -1 and 1 so it's normalized (the data is a sine wave). Just to see how DataNormalization works, I multiplied all the data values by 10. I then used both NormalizerStandardize() and NormalizerMinMaxScaler() with, well disastrous results. The score at each iteration initially balloons to huge levels and the test output that was previously a near perfect sine wave, is completely wrong. How I'm using it:  [<-CODE->] I can't see how I'm doing anything wrong (there's really no documentation on this). Is it best to normalize myself (as it appears to be)? 
solution: 

issue: @fsparvthe following diagrams are all 2D. I'm surmising that each blue dot along the bottom in the next diagaram is actually a set of N rnn neurons if you have N features, right?yes, that's correct raver119: @MrDallOcayes, learningRate(double) is gone, and that's intentional. As are all the schedule-related things on the main builderinstead: the only option is to use .updater(new Adam(learningRate)) etcit's a bit of a transition, but it's much more reliable/robustotherwise suppose you did .learningRate(x).updater(new Adam()) or .learningRate(x).updater(new Adam(y)) it's error prone / much less clear what is intended not to mention that some updaters don'thavelearning rates at all 
solution: fsparv: that's incorrect - if you use in -> RNN -> RnnOutputLayer... you would have a pair of green outputs ateverytime step (ignoring any masking), and they would depend on only the current time step RNN activations - not fully connected across all time steps like that. 

issue: Is it possible to use the Parallel Wrapper in my scala (maven) project? When I add the wrapper scala is started to give errors... 
solution: 

issue: differences in weight initialization, learning rate, updater configuration, etc can also do it and no, not necessarily 
solution: VERY dumb. 

issue: From my point of view the problem with toy problems is that you don't really learn much when using dl4j 
solution: 

issue: We could definitely reword a few of our pages. I only have strong opinions on this because we teach DL to folks and I see what they waste time on. Every one makes the same mistakes That and data as well yes It's very true. You also waste atonof time if you underestimate the complexity 
solution: 

issue: it reminds me of the AlphaGoZero paper I was looking at, where the headline was "hey, the neural net just trains itself by playing against itself!!" and the reality was radically more complex with plenty of very application-specific work and I think the disconnect for@jvenceis that this library isn't designed to play with toy problems -- which is what you've said over and over I always think when using a Java library that you're obviously not going to get the easiest route, and the power you get in return is obviously that you now have everything in Java yeah, I expect there's a relatively easy tweak to the docs to telegraph this to users I say that knowing it would take quite a long time :D maybe a "what you can expect from this lib" section anyway, you're very successful, I think you know what you are doing, don't worry about my suggestions on this the problem I've been recovering from is not knowing about Lean management 
solution: I think the reality, that you've touched on many times now, is that DNNs are much more technical than people expect. 

issue: to be realistic though, companies like Amazon seem to have experienced a very strange existence where they could spend huge amounts of money only with the assumption they'd finally come out on top... but let's not go into all that! 
solution: you bet on a too far flung future, having to pivot. 

issue: Hello and happy new year together! Quick question regarding graphic cards. I am about to buy a new one and currently thinking on geforce 1080ti. However, there was the news that it can't be used for DL anymore due to driver limitations/modifications. 1) can the 1080ti still be used for DL4J as well? 2) which graphic card would you recommend for DL4J treo: thanks for confirming! 
solution: 

issue: the license change only affected data center use nvidia basically wants you to buy a tesla if you want to put it into a datacenter Concerning price to performance my best guess is a 1080ti as well 
solution: 

issue: can someone explain me what is th noOP() function in the rl4j.space.ActionSpace interface? because I am implementing my own ActionSpace class but I am not sure what I am supposed to make it return from this function...

I am hittingInvalid input for RNN layer (layer index = -1, layer name = "lstm_1"): expect RNN input type with size > 0. Got: InputTypeFeedForward(50) There was a discussion in [<-ISSUE->] " Then I thought that the patch comes with 0.92? Thank you!@agibsonccc, I also looked around, Keras support will also be in 0.92? 
solution: 

issue: Cool@agibsoncccyou answered my questions I appreciate your time 
solution: nd4j-native-platform is the other one.

solution: 

issue: Hello, Is there any examples of DL4J used on android? yeah i am reading this page, but I thought if there is a whole project... if not I'll just try out all the dependencies and come back to u... 
solution: 

issue: but this means, then I have to train my own vector, can not I use a trained vector in DL4J? 
solution: 

issue: in snapshots there’s iterator for that i think sorry listener :) you could just copy it into your project 
solution: 

issue: I'm absolutely no expert (actually a noob) But I know using neural nets requires lots of data and examples (if you're planning to use such) Wouldn't you be better off creating simulations? Like, tons of them There would be, however, the pain of creating them (and multiple scenarios, I guess) 
solution: 

issue: raver119: any official doc for code given in video? 
solution: i've thought it should be in dl4j-examples, but can't find it there.. yes it works, but there's issue with additional sessions atm. 

issue: Is ui  woking with prallel wrapper? It doesn't show any iterations... in each session should it be showing some data...

solution: ekravi:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Is there anything you should do to make sure RecordReaderDataSetIterator is cleaned up when no longer in use? 
solution: 

issue: I'm looking for an INDArray broadcasting method to subtract a (J x K) matrixBfrom a (I x J x K) tensorA, am I blind or is there none? A.subRowVector(B)seems to work fine whenAis a matrix of shape (I x J) andBis a vector of length J, but this doesnt work analogeous for higher orders. Is there another method? A.sub(B.broadcast(A.shape()))works fine, thanks (y) with automated broadcasting you meanB.broadcast(A.shape())will be called insub(..)automatically when necessary? 
solution: 

issue: hi a am copied the conf() - settings from org/deeplearning4j/zoo/model/LeNet.java in Version 0.9.2-SNAPSHOT and run in an exception in the activation of a SubsamplingLayer 
solution: SubsamplingLayer calls Convolution.pooling2D(..)  calls Pooling2D.builder() with 3 arguments, but the build() method of the Pooling2D.builder() needs at least one more argument. SDVariable[] inputs is null and run in an exception in DifferentialFunction because it is called in a for-loop as args: for(int i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {. 

issue: Hi,After many days i got 0.91 of acuracy in my model... now i wanna load this saved model for trying to fit a little bit more...The first train was made with a RestNet50 model pretrained with ImageNet and i trained it using ComputationGraph and TransferLearning...When i use restoreMultiLayerNetwork() it return me a MultiLayerNetwork. Should i continue training it using this object.fit() or i have to use TransferLearning again?! Well, i tried this and i got this error:  [<-LINK->] also, i checked the file, it is there and with 3 files inside the zip yes... i was trying to do this but take a look at the error above  [<-LINK->] i have no ideia why i cannot load and init it 
solution: 

issue: ramsestom: i think it might be issue with 0D/1D in 0.9.1. Before yesterday there were NO 0D/1D arrays allowed in ND4j, and new int[] {16} is effectively vector, 1D array. next release (and current master) should allow that shape without any problems and for 0.9.1 and below vector shape should be {1, 16} 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I am new to DeepLearning4j 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: so basically they are backpropagate sequentially? Am I right, 1 by 1. Dividing them by 3 make them average 
solution: 

issue: Could you explain a bit more what that would mean? I'm already passing in zeroes for the pad values, e.g.[0 0 0 0 ... 35 41 23]. do i need to write my own preprocesser? 
solution: maxpumperla:. 

issue: I am very sorry of disturbing you and paste ugly code. I started use spark just for calculating topn of two sets vectors for recommender system . Spark is fast and is such easy to use ~ . Then I start loving spark and bigdata~~,  how to say . I start loving bigdata and I need to go forward even I know I am a newbee. I accept help from my workmates and everybody who is vertern  ,also I am not native in English. The example start running now ~~ Thanks everybody 
solution: if we start teaching all of spark too this channel would get hit with a lot of unrelated questions. 

issue: agibsonccc: no problem! I can see where someone new is coming from. the thing is this library is extensive, and getting to basics is not trivial using that quick start page. it's not clear when you first come to the library how things are supposed to work. the first timer probably asks: so you dive into datavec? etc actually@tejchaniyou should probably buy and read the 'Deep Learning' book for deeplearning4j to understand how everything works 
solution: as well as the rationale. 

issue: I’ve downloaded SKIL CE and have successfully gone through part of the Welcome to SKIL CE v1.0.1 quickstart. I’m having trouble understanding the part where the instructions say to “delete the blocks of template code” from the notebook, and “copy and paste blocks of code from the GitHub link above into the notebook”. When I deleted all of the blocks from the notebook, and then cut and pasted all of the Scala code into one block from the link, I received an error when running. I also don’t understand where the subsequent Java code snippets are supposed to go. Any guidance would be appreciated. 
solution: i think so. 

issue: Hi,I splitted all the images of my train and test datasets for increasing it... so when i do the evaluation with the test dataset, i got the accuracy of the images splitted...Great... it works fine, but i would like to evaluate the model using the original images... i mean, i have to evaluate grouping the images (each 72 images is 1 original image)...Is there any implementation for dealing with this on DL4J or i have to do this using a classic looping?!Thanks 
solution: 

issue: Hi, when I use spark default Serialization  everything works fine in my CNN application, but when I change serialization to Kryo  I am getting NaN for scoring. any suggestion? yes I did as it suggested in [<-LINK->] spark 2.2.0dl4j 0.9.1nd4j-kryo_2.11  0.9.1 
solution: 

issue: We are going to test our application made on dl4j on AIX system.Will the system run on it or nd4j will not work ? 
solution: it's all bundled as part of nd4j-native-platform already. 

issue: aix is a unix variant for power it looks like? yes so an operating system is not a chip they are very different things :D we run onchips OSes do as well AIX is power. Nd4j supports power power is the chip yep you can see the other classifiers there like android android-x86 android-arm 
solution: Let us know if you run in to any issues. 

issue: Hello guys. When will 0.9.2 deploy on maven. Do you have a plan? Looking forward the new features(keras2.0 model import) 
solution: 

issue: Mind filing an !issue with more details? 
solution: 

issue: I am getting an nvcc cuda error. I do not want to use CUDA...I want to use only CPUs for computing. I am instantiating a NeuralNetConfiguration. Can I specify about the backend in the NeuralNetConfiguration object ? Is anybody there ? Is anyone there ? 
solution: hryptr: You need to specify this in your maven settings.. 

issue: I want to run the examples provided using just CPUs...yesterday skymind said it was possible... I want to predict folk music... yes...i want to use the existing jars available...not build it from source if that is not needed... 
solution: You don't need to and we tell that to you in multiple place in our docs. 

issue: Firstly, Adam, thanks for yesterday's guidance mate. It really helped a lot. The model is converging and learning well. Thanks again for everything, you're awesome!And could you just quickly see this UI snap and validate that it seems fine? :)  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: maybe its because I have set the learning rate a little high. (0.1) I have to reduce it down to 0.05 thoughBut i already have drop out and l2 regularization for the overfit. Isnt that enough? 
solution: will do. But this was just to have an idea of things are working. :) Thank you once again for that :DYes i will try out the learning rates and the regularization parameters.Just a note : For some reasons NESEROV was explording my model score. Going to around 100trillions and after some point the activation will drop. Idk, Adam works for my use case better I guess.. 

issue: adityarar: to be clear, you'll need to build from source if you intend to run on AIX and not Linux 
solution: But I believe AIX has container tech to run Linux applications, so you could just run it as a Linux app. 

issue: Can libnd4j/cmake run on there? 
solution: Is there a command to check that. We just acquired this system.. 

issue: Please use !gist to show code and error messages

issue: hey guys, when I do my evaluation for regression, im getting \'Exception in thread "ADSI prefetch thread" java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.NullPointerException: toPreProcess\' do you have any idea why that error occurs? what do you mean? 
solution: 

issue: tom-adsfund: dl4j is apache/MIT/BSD for deps the ASF itself uses us 3 different projects does that relieve you at all? We're not greenhonrs :D I know that matters for a ton of companies We passed their audit process long ago We had to be compliant for eclipse foundation as well looking forward to it :D jny0714mj: we need the whole stack trace in a !gist please not much context to go  on here I still can't tell where the problem is coming from..I need the whole !gist please bazinga29: @saudetwould know the answer to that question I'm sure it's possible. SidneyLann: use nd4j-native-platform? you've been with us a while I'm surprised you haven't seen that by now? :D 
solution: 

issue: What are the minimal maven dependencies to be able to use DL4J? I had a look at the examples pom.xml but there were a lot of dependencies listed. I don't want to depend on any spark or scala related dependency. 
solution: jny0714mj: you need to fit the normalizer first. 

issue: Trying to use rl4j with my own MDP but looks like there is a bug with the action selection at each step. Isn't the training algorithm supposed to request the possible actionspace (by calling getActionSpace()) before each step(Integer action) call? Because it appear not to be the case 
solution: 

issue: SidneyLann: I think you need to install OpenBLAS on your machine 
solution: you typically shouldn't need to. yous shouldn't need openblas if you use javacpp and the like. 

issue: Hi Adam, it worked well, thank you! 
solution: 

issue: Is there any docs on using mmaped data? I remember@agibsoncccsaying that support for it has been added to nd4j some time ago... searching through the code, all I can find is that it is used with workspaces Ok, then I'll assume it is exactly what I've found 
solution: 

issue: amoellmann: should be possible, this is how the UI does it [<-LINK->] something analogous should be possible (heading off, so I don't have time to check/test right now)ping me via gitter (or open an issue) if you can't work it out and I'll take a look tomorrow

solution: 

issue: Hy,For using my GPU with deeplearning4j should i have cuDNN installed as well? 
solution: if you are using deeplearning4j-cuda, you should, yes. does dl4j work without it as well with the GPU?. 

issue: Hy,when using GPUs, do I need to change both [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->] for the cuda version or only nd4j? mst2808: Read about [<-LINK->] Accuracy is to be understood as percentage obviously 
solution: Yes. agibsonccc: fantastic work!. !tuning. 

issue: hi,dear sir,  my loss score occurred Nan after 100 epoch, what's reason for this? 
solution: 

issue: Accuracy is low or network isn't learning? Start by reading [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->] DL4J book (Deep Learning: A Practitioner's Approach) now available at [<-LINK->] Unfortunately, i'm just a bot and can't get beyond that yet to answer you :( 
solution: yan24639916: if you need a deep learning tutorial this is not the place. You should be asking only clarifying questions in this context. We expect people to read.. 

issue: Hey,When I try to load iris data file with:    recordReader.initialize(new FileSplit(new ClassPathResource(irisDataFile).getFile()))I get error:Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Resource \'file:///home/arturro/data/iris.data.csv\' cannot be found.        at org.datavec.api.util.ClassPathResource.getUrl(ClassPathResource.java:86) I'm following the example [<-LINK->] nope, via spark2-submit at my yarn cluster in client mode so the driver is local 
solution: that example makes completely different assumptions. 

issue: AlexDBlack: I'm trying different loss functions. Regarding my labels, they are all in range [-1,1]. Is that fine for Identity activation? Or should they be between [0,1]? 
solution: both should be fineI'd be much more interested in your choice of loss function though. 

issue: Hello,I’m running into issues while running a compiled jar (including dl4j-lib) on an other system. It’s working fine on the system I complied it on. Are there any prerequisites needed on the operating system?Thank you for your help!

issue: Hi. Are there any adjustments required to my pom If I want to use 0.9.2-SNAPSHOT? The dependencies can't be downloaded... Do I have to add a special repo? Ah found it. 
solution: !snapshots. SanderGielisse: not really, ComputationGraph assumes that it can be non-linear. 

issue: why not? run full ff pass and get back map with activations of all layers 
solution:

issue: Hello :-) Can I have access to the night builds artifacts? I did not find it anywhere :< I would like to try 0.9.2 
solution: !snapshots. 

issue: I'm looking at SameDiff , I see that there is already Linear Module, so I understand nd4j will be deep learning framework on its own? once you got Module you do not need dl4j Linear linear = Linear.execBuilder().nIn(nIn).nOut(4).weightInitScheme(new UniformInitScheme('f',nIn)).biasWeightInitScheme(new ZeroInitScheme('f')).build();linear.exec(Nd4j.linspace(1,20,20).reshape(4,5)); 
solution: 

issue: cpuheater: we’ll wrap samediff into dl4j layers, see this pending PR: [<-ISSUE->] a good analogy might be that nd4j is to dl4j what tensorflow is to keras. low-level autodiff lib powering higher level framework. 
solution: enormous work you have done and I guess still need to be done. 

issue: not that way :) one sec .activation(new DiscreteParameterSpace<>(Activation.RELU, Activation.SOFTPLUS, Activation.LEAKYRELU)) etc you can do something similar with IActivation instances too if required 
solution: 

issue: Ok, can python numpy arrays be converted into INDArrays then? via Jumpy for example I am planning the workload trying to cut corners by not implementing training/evaluation for DL4J version. 
solution: 

issue: Hi! I was wondering if there was any equivalent to Keras's [<-LINK->] in dl4j. Specifically I'm interested in the image augmentations. I found datavec's [<-LINK->] that should fit most of my needs. 
solution: yeah. 

issue: I could make a branch on scorch to investigate that, and see how it works out samediff, is that implemented in nd4j or deeplearning4j? I had a look at it some time ago, but can't find it back ok. And the current snapshot is a good starting point? I'll take a closer look. Have to attend to work that pays now 
solution: 

issue: padriba: depends what you mean by "deal with"but if you just want to read it in for training a net (like CSV examples), it\'s not all loaded into memory or anything like that 
solution: check DMs btw. That's usually an indicator you're not normalizing your labels.

issue: Hi@AlexDBlack,  Is the following issue is closed . Else can you give me some workaround ? In  " [<-LINK->] " [<-ISSUE->] there was a bug in nesterov state (all other updaters were ok)basically it\'d train finebut wasn\'t being serialized properly (as it wasn\'t using a view of the state array)" Thank you I will check sure Thanks once again. Hi@treo, using 0.9.1 version. First i used Nestrov , then i tried with Adam Adam retrain model got the same accuracy as my reference model I tried to retrain my old model with new samples for image classification 
solution: 

issue: is this for a real application that you need to solve right now? Hirsl: it's a bit odd to me you're asking other people to complete the core of your bachelor's thesis. I could solve this problem for you with one suggestion, but it seems wrong to do the work for you 
solution: 

issue: liloup1789: "sequence vectors" isn\'t a concept it's just an abstraction over word2vec and some other algorithms paravec isn't a good classifier for multi label I'm not sure what you've read on any of these techniques but you can't give bag of words to an algorithm that is embeddings based that by definition fails In general you should aim to just use a normal classifier if you can try good ole logistic regression + bag of words

issue: treo: No only the crash file: hs_err_pid18912.log.  I went through all the configurations and saw a spark dependency on my classpath, After clearing my maven directory it ran without any problems . Java version  "1.8.0_162" DL4J  0.9.1.@raver119Problem I had yesterday is resolved.  thanks for the help. 
solution: 

issue: deltamike276: still interesting. would you share the crash file in a gist? I'd like to see what has ultimately caused it even if it is resolved now sorensf: to me it just looks like it is either a memory fragmentation problem, or that your large number of objects somehow slows down the java gc You might want to try different GC to see if there is any difference the problem you described still occurs even with 0.9.1, just tried it myself on one of the examples 
solution: 

issue: Ok, I\'ve tried as well (again on 0.8.0) and set Nd4j.getMemoryManager().togglePeriodicGc(false); and the slowdowns are reduced significantly, however I keep getting "Out of [DEVICE] memory (...)" but that should be fixed if I had workspaces enabled right? 
solution: sorensf: the underlying issue is that you have lots of objects on the heap, and the gc can stop everything to do its job - and when you aren't using workspaces nd4j will ask for a gc run quite often. I've attached a performance listener to the model, and the iteration time stayed exactly the same, no matter the amount of objects.

solution: 

issue: Hello. I have a ComputationGraph that takes two inputs. Is it possible to provide it these inputs as a single INDArray (to call the graph.output(input) method like this: graph.output(INDArray mergedinputs)) or not? OK. Is it possible to split the input with SubsetVertex when the ComputationGraph is receiving the input then and to pass each of these sub inputs to their respective graph entry? yes they are of the same type and shape.So I can just do something like .addVertex("input1", new SubsetVertex(0,4), "mergedinput") .addVertex("input2", new SubsetVertex(5,12), "mergedinput") and it should work? 
solution: Also, in the case of a Computationgraph where one part is recursive (a LSTM) and the other not, how do you define the tBPTTForwardLength and tBPTTBackwardLength of the recursive part and the type of inputs?Currently, in my graphbuilder, I had something like: [<-CODE->] but if my graph inputs are now merged before being split with SubsetVertex, I can't define their types in setInputTypes() anymore.Also applying tBPTTForwardLength and tBPTTBackwardLength on the global graph seems weird as only part of it is made of recursive layers.... The input I am providing to the network is now composed of two merged parts. One part that, after being extracted with SubsetVertex, will feed the recurent (LSTM) subnetwork and another part that will feed a non-recurrent subnetwork (outputs of these two subnetworks are then combined into a global output).  But I don't know how to define .setInputTypes() for a subnetwork... (it seems to only apply to the actual input(s) of the full graph)what I had is: [<-CODE->] And now with the new architecture I have: [<-CODE->]. 

issue: AlexDBlack: That's too bad, but thank you for the reply. I'll try training the network elsewhere and see if I can import it to dl4j. From what I can tell the latest snapshot supports all the components in my network. 
solution: 

issue: lot of stuff, if you got some idea , how to start , something small and simple, otherwise I could look are C++ and see I can I implement simple OPS 
solution: 

issue: if you're having the same problem as you did with the old version of spark, did you check your spark submit config?

issue: well a GlobalPooling Layer doesn't seems to be what I am looking for. What I want is a layer that  extract the last timeserie column of a [minibatch, size, timeSeriesLength] output shape to obtain a [minibatch, size] output for the last step of my timeserie. And GlobalPooling doesn't seem to offer this option (As it name suggest, it seems to be done to combine every step of a timeSerie into a unique one, not to extract one) 
solution: 

issue: ramsestom: did you work out your issue?note that your network configuration looks bad. you have an RnnOutputLayer in the middle of the network, which isn't possible/viableand (assuming ws_input) is the non-time series input, you can't merge it with time series activations obviouslyif you want thelasttime step instead of global pooling, you can use LastTimeStepVertex, or if you're on snapshots (not 0.9.1) you can use the LastTimeStep layer wellingtonfoz: for MSE  use RegressionEvaluation class as for NLL on say a test set - it isn't saved in the net itself, but you can calculate it using one of the score or scoreExamples methods [<-LINK->]

issue: I'd like to create a 'system of systems' out of MultiLayerNetworks. I've got two trained nn models that I'd like to use as inputs to a third. Any suggestions? possibly, but I can't see how you would add an existing trained MultiLayerNetwork as a layer/ 
solution: 

issue: I get some very weird results, here. My (uninformed) guess is, that I missed something with the memory management. I have the following situation: I use a computation graph and train it with external errors.\nThe computation of the external errors uses some Nd4j functions\nFrom time to time, the gradient gets some NaN (which will of course break everything), although the error and the input, as well as the internal weight are all reasonable (between -10 and 10)\nThere is a way to avoid NaN: instead of updating the weights, just recompute output and gradients. Is someone here, who has experience with such odd behavior?

issue: I am trying to use a LSTM to predict a continuous value output (that can be negative or positive) But I can't make it work. I tried with various activation functions (TANH, RELU, IDENTITY, none) but none worked (in all case, the network never output negative values). Could someone that master LSTM help me here? (I have a pet example with a sigmoid curve where I feed the network with Y point values on the curve (taken at regular steps along the X-axis)  and try to predict the Y value of the next point (or in fact the variation in Y value between this future point and the last one passed to the LSTM network)) and can provide the code for testing if necessary) 
solution: @SanderGielisseOK. I changed my graph structure to: [<-CODE->] and it seems to work fine now. Thanks!Seems like applying LossFunction.MSE to the RnnOutputLayer (instead of no LossFunction) solved the issue (I already tried with TANH activation for LSTM layers and IDENTITY for the output one previously but I think I had LossFunction.MCXENT or no loss function on the last output layer which is probably why it didn't work).

If you have some time can you please have a quick look on my current implementation of DataSetIterator because I am not sure if I feed the data into the network correctly and probably not feeding/getting out data correctly when calling net.output(INDArray)  (getForecast(...) method). When I use Evaluation I get strange results (I get pretty good scores while training also -> "Score at iteration 35919 is 2.809292946418888E-8"). However, when I iterate through data on my own and use getForecast(...) I do not get good results. I suspect that I am not feeding correctly the data into the network, I am not using correctly net.output(INDArray) or probably both.

Is it correct or should I do it like: first mini batch 0, 1, 2 + result 3; second mini batch 3, 4, 5 + result 6 and so on.. if I go with the second option doesn't the network training loose a lot of training examples (2/3 with 3 time steps)?

What I get is weird though:2018-02-01 17:18:03,843 INFO  d.s.f.c.t.TCBIterator - Next was called with batchSize 12018-02-01 17:18:04,300 INFO  d.s.f.c.t.TCBClassificationTrainingJob - Iteration: 0 done!2018-02-01 17:18:05,189 INFO  d.s.f.c.t.TCBIterator - Next was called with batchSize 12018-02-01 17:18:05,216 INFO  d.s.f.c.t.TCBIterator - Next was called with batchSize 12018-02-01 17:18:05,241 INFO  d.s.f.c.t.TCBIterator - Next was called with batchSize 1.... I can't figure out how can it happen that next() method is called but the IterationListener is not invoked.

issue: Hello! Can I use CSVSequenceRecordReader with EmbeddingLayer?For example, how I create csvReader [<-CODE->] Addition constants: [<-CODE->] And config: [<-CODE->] When I start fit my model, I have an exception: [<-CODE->] Where 200 coming from minibatch size. And i can't find my error, can you help me please?When I use hot-one vector representation of my input, I don't have any problem(without embedding layer)My input example [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: Hello. I have rnn model with inputs > outputs. Is it possible to predict multiple time steps? If i understood from examples its usually done with iterating predictions over previous predictions but if the number of inputs doesn't match outputs then I can't use output in prediction right? :) 
solution: 

issue: I'm trying to figure out why on each epoch, ALL examples, no matter what they are labeled are classified as the same value. The value they are classified as changes on each epoch. I'm using a CNN for audio files (as spectrograms)  with a softmax output. Can any see anything wrong with this next() method in my custom iterator? [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: @agibsoncccwhat is the reason I seem to get better results (cost goes systematically smaller when starting from random weights) using ND4J compared to Breeze? Do I have a bug in somewhere or is there some precision difference between the implementations? 
solution: 

issue: One thing I was dreaming of while doing all the in-place changes to my example code was an AST-based approach that would mask all that for me, i.e. make everything lazy so the system could decide for it self when it can use inplace operations and when it needs to be immutable

issue: mehul-m-prajapati: Welcome! Here's a link to Deeplearning4j's Gitter Guidelines, our documentation and other DeepLearning resources online. Please explore these and enjoy! [<-LINK->] Unfortunately, i'm just a bot and can't get beyond that yet to answer you :( 
solution: 

issue: have you read the paper in detail? ok, start there but basically, YOLO is not a classifier 
solution: someone used yolo recently in the article above there maybe poke around there a bit. you don't get the localization component from classification datasets (no bounding boxes). 

issue: I mean every framework is dag basedYeah, they say this in the paper "c  is  presented  to  the  hidden  layers  via  the  window  layer (with a delay in the connection to the first hidden layer to avoid a cycle in the graph)." 
solution: 

issue: Getting hold of it can be a hassle, that's one reason not to use it :P what exactly do you mean by that? 
solution: If you wanted to you could build a classifier wrapper or something like that I suppose?. 

issue: Hello, I am receiving an error concerning input array depth. I am trying to use inception model with convolutional layers. Message is pasted below. Help will be appreciated Exception in thread "main" org.deeplearning4j.exception.DL4JInvalidInputException: Cannot do forward pass in Convolution layer (layer name = inception-3a-cnn1-1, layer index = 19): input array depth does not match CNN layer configuration (data input depth = 448, [minibatch,inputDepth,height,width]=[4, 448, 28, 28]; expected input depth = 192) (layer name: inception-3a-cnn1-1, layer index: 19) 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: is there still a need for a comparative benchmark of Breeze vs. ND4J? I didn't get sufficiently bored yesterday evening to get going with it, and I'm not sure I want the pain of using Scala with JMH I'll probably start with recreating the benchmarks from [<-LINK->] 
solution: input array depth does not match CNN layer configuration (data input depth = 448, [minibatch,inputDepth,height,width]=[4, 448, 28, 28]; expected input depth = 192). 

issue: Hi, any further input on error faced "input array depth does not match"? So where should I change the value? 
solution: 

issue: @AlexDBlack, thanks. It\'s work, but can you explain me, please, why I should use setInputType? Where can I read about it? And will it work with "many to one" correctly? but why without embedding layer everything works fine? 
solution: 

issue: mdnoorit: if you reask the same question 1 more time while ignoring responses you are banned seriously 
solution: since it is more active channel. 

issue: if I want to do a regression where I want a cost function that enforces a range of 0 to 1... is there a standard way to do that? 
solution: 

issue: Okay, I am in a position not able to load all the dl4j and nd4j jars to the build. I am looking for a simple way to represent the model and do predictions in realtime any suggestions are realy welcomed 
solution: I work with govts. Whatever you're working on can't be that secret :D. 

issue: you want to find the way to throw away whole math magic (and its deps) from dl4j model? 
solution: 

issue: @tom-adsfundnot do sigmoid or softmax, which are clearly not probabilitiesstrictly, no, though you can treat them as such :)anyway, I'm not sure having an unbounded activation (not in 0 to 1) helps you if you want a probability distribution? 
solution: AlexDBlack: so the idea is I want to train it to approximate the probability of the event, and so I want a regression, and then I thought, the best I can do to help the network during training is enforce 0 to 1. 

issue: AlexDBlack: can't we quite easily (obviously not so easily if I'm not doing it myself) just penalize values that fall outside the range? 
solution: 

issue: tom-adsfund: maybe you want KL divergence with sigmoid then, if you're trying to reproduce a probability distribution? coughcalibration post trainingcough I mean I'm still not seeing anything here that can't be solved with what's been proposed 
solution: there's a million other references out there on it, that's juth the first one I found. 

issue: AlexDBlack: , can you explain me plaese(again :) ), why if I set InputType.recurent(2), I don't have any exception while fitting my model? Is it correct behavior?I want to remind, that my input is: [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: by the way, that is what you get when you use just the minimal deps andmvn org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:check [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: @raver119  I found some powerful nodes with CUDA 9 installed. tried to use nd4j cuda 9 platform  but it gave an error so I tried with nd4j cuda 8 platform and it gave this error:https://goo.gl/3VqMYGShould I look for nodes with cuda 8 toolkit or upgrade nd4j  platform to version 9 
solution: it was released before cuda 9 was released. 

issue: treo: I think you are correct. I greped the imports from the examples and there were just a handful of classes. Never the less, I took@raver199's suggestion and wrote an issue in github 
solution: 

issue: varishm: can you post the entire exception stack trace in a !gist along with your pom.xml? NisreenAlaas: that's probably just MNIST download error due to bad internet or something... impossible to say for sure without the full error, but try to delete the MNIST directory in your home directory and try again 
solution: varishm: add nd4j-native-platform to your deps too. 

issue: are there examples available for 0.9.2? it seems that the NN configuration setup changed a little bit  [<-LINK->] I changed to nd4j_native and am getting this: [<-CODE->] I am seeing this [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: Dathiou: fyi - [<-ISSUE->] should be up to date or close to (re: api changes) 
solution: 

issue: I run into log semirings when reading. How hard would it be to operate on those using ND4J. Multiplication is trivial (just addition), but addition is a bit more complex. 
solution: 

issue: is there any remaining chance to solve [<-ISSUE->] ? otherwhise i go back to  0.9.1 and CUDA 8.0 i tried 9.1 because i had troubles with 8.0 as well 
solution: 

issue: yes i think so too, but i have no idea what im doing wrong, but probably you are right and my recent CUDA 8.0 installation was broken.. what do you recomment a new CUDA 8.0 installation or 9.0? ok, i try it, thank you 
solution: 

issue: Hello, I am trying to download DL4J for Linux (Ubuntu) but can't find the link. Can someone please help me? SanderGielisse: Thank You Sir :) 
solution: 

issue: tom-adsfund: transfer learning is something you can customize..it can work with anything as long as you define the layers right 
solution: 

issue: I made a pull request 12 minutes ago to merge into deeplearning4j:master.   But it's not showing on the right. [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: hey, i'm just getting started again on d4j, how can I get the full working library on intellij without downloading all the examples ? 
solution: homer12d: you just need to add the right dependencies in your POM file.  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: Here's a pull request for my changes to refactor and clean up the MIDI melody extraction for the dl4j-examples program  MelodyModelingExample.java [<-ISSUE->] FYI, it extracts melodies from midi files and uses a LSTM recurrent network to compose melodies. 
solution: 

issue: tom-adsfund: i got an issue, i added the dependencies in pom.xml, files got downloaded but when i try to import the libs, intellij can't find them 
solution: have you gone back to the pom after the files downloaded, and checked if it wants to auto download anything. 

issue: That is definitely not our problem :D You'll have to set it up to load the proper one. Your PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH need to be configured. 
solution: 

issue: Is there some dl4j method that I can call to get the loaded cuda driver/lib? 
solution: 

issue: Hello@raver119and@agibsoncccI don\'t know if you remember but I had a multilabel problem for very few sentences and a lot of classes. I managed to generalize the CnnSentenceClassification class so it works with multiclass. Still I have somme issue : -> it throws me an error of shape every time I add a layer ( .addLayer("cnn3", new ConvolutionLayer.Builder() ) and every time I change the input of the layer (.nIn(1)). Is there something I should change so it works ? raver119: yes it works :) Thanks ! And I take all of your advice ! 
solution: 

issue: do you think rnn/cnn work well with binary dataset with ratio like 1:999? 
solution: so, first what i'd try here is double precision + weighted loss.. 

issue: tranva: yeah, you can try weighted lossbut the first thing to try is usually just threshold shiftingi.e., specify class 1 prediction as being >0.1 (or whatever) instead of 0.5in practice, use a ROC curve to see what performance is like at different thresholds - !evaluation

issue: hello everyone! Is there some example of NN using non-static word2vec? I mean, how can I update and optimize my input (embeddings) when the model is training? I obtain the embeddings from a FLAT file. Thanks! 
solution: 

issue: sricholkar: should work just fine? just specify the number of outputs on your RnnOutputLayer with nOut(n) 
solution: 

issue: hey guys i'm getting some weird error here "SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder".SLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementationSLF4J: See [<-LINK->] for further details." can someone help me on this ? 
solution: slf4j is pretty standard as far as logging on the JVM. alright, looks like maven is updating something. 

issue: like image mask? they are mask 
solution: *masks. in image processing they are called mask. there r lots of them in opencv. 

issue: I see there is a mmul with transpose added in master... when will it be released? 
solution: hvesalai: if you're using CPU you should be ok with snapshots.. keep that option in mind :). and any feedback for new stuff is welcome :). treo:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: So i should have dediced low level optimization out of the box for video cards that supports it, thinking about the Titan V 
solution: the big thing for V arch is TensorCore stuff. it shines on matrix multiplications of specific sizes. basically CNN is biggest beneficiary arch for it. but there are specific considerations apply. 

issue: System.out.println(vec.similarity("california", "californian")); by calling this similarity I am getting some values. on what base it calulates the value?  what is formula? 
solution: this is matrix. I set layersize 3.. 

issue: california -0.11845454573631287 -0.5459250807762146 -1.3719596862792969 these values are weights right? how it calclulates the weights by input word? 
solution: w2v adjust weights during training. if you want more details - you can read them in w2v paper, it's available at arxiv.org. 

issue: Is it correct to create input preprocessor which will reshape [batchSize * 2, inputSize] to [batchSize, inputSize * 2]? My goal is:I want to use embedding layer + convembedding layer  has input[[1], [2], [3], [4]] - it is one sentence with shape [4, 1].embedding layer will produce, for example[[1, 0, 0, 0], [0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]]Then I want to pass this data to conv layer. At this step I have shape [4, 4]but the correct shape is [1,1,4,4]So i need to add a preprocessor to transform shape from embeding layer to conv layer.But If I use feedForwardToCNN i will not have the correct shape 
solution: 

issue: before running dl4j example, I print nvcc --version, it shows:nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driverCopyright (c) 2005-2016 NVIDIA CorporationBuilt on Sun_Sep__4_22:14:01_CDT_2016Cuda compilation tools, release 8.0, V8.0.44But still getting: CUDA error at /home/jenkins/workspace/dl4j/all-multiplatform@2_linux-x86_64/stream1/libnd4j/blas/cuda/NativeOps.cu:4729 code=46(cudaErrorDevicesUnavailable) "result"... 
solution: it's usually bad idea to have > 1 driver installed. 

issue: localmaxima: @raver119some versions of the driver have issues running in Java, something about memory over 2GB or so. Either try to reduce memory allocated by the JVM or try to install newer drivers 
solution: 

issue: runningXin: you should be fine with !snapshots I believe..beyond that please ask@maxpumperlafor features or file an !issue thanks! 
solution: 

issue: remove the \'try\', as replacing \' try (MemoryWorkspace ws = Nd4j.getWorkspaceManager().getAndActivateWorkspace(mmap, "M2")) { \' to \' MemoryWorkspace ws = Nd4j.getWorkspaceManager().getAndActivateWorkspace(mmap, "M2"); \' is the same. How should i rewrite my code?

solution: RajaniVM:. 

issue: where did you get that version from o_0? In fact where did you get that artifact id from ? 
solution: you have to do some special digging to bring that up :D. 

issue: mboyanov: can you give me a little more context please, e.g. can you point me to your keras model you’re using etc.? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, noob question here: I was asked to do a pull request for an issue I posted for datavec, but as I guess I can't create a new branch as I'm not a contributor I Think I did that, but I might have gotten it wrong Ill check out the link and get back if neede3d 
solution: 

issue: KolyaIvankov: added post 0.9.1: you may be able to copy + paste (with hopefully minimal changes) [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: homer12d: it depends where you're calling getParam and setParam. if you call it on MultiLayerNetwork, there's a convention for the names that feeds it to a layer. if you call it on a layer there's the weight key... you can see it in the source code, where it uses DefaultParamInitializer.WEIGHT_KEY once you get to an extension of the BaseLayer class 
solution: I'd still generally avoid it though..you shoudn't be monkeying with that stuff unless you know what you're doing. 

issue: adam, I was thinking of copying to and from my GPU and CPU RAM a few times before starting training... does nd4j allow that, and would it improve performance by warming everything up?

I have set up the GPU (GTX1070) with CUDA 8 but, unfortunately, it uses only 2% of my GPU...Do GPUs provide any performance increase when it comes to normal dense layers? Using MKL was faster as examples/sec. What would you consider large :D ? I just want to see my gpu ramping up for testing purposes

issue: Ngosti2000: Ok I've accelerated NativeImageLoader a bit, but it doesn't look like that's the bottleneck that you are experiencing: [<-ISSUE->] Are you sure that you have workspaces enabled? [<-LINK->] That could save a lot of time in GC 
solution: 

issue: Yeah, I have not looked into processor development for some time, so I thought that they had developed something new. But I do know my Von Neumann  I started my coding carreer in the demoscene (kids need to google what that means) with x86 assembler as a kid way back in the 90s. 
solution: 

issue: and somewhere along the way something optimizes them so that the graph doesn't have to think about .dups and in-place operations? (or whether to use gemm or not)

solution: 

issue: saudet: @raver119just seen some weird behavior.. i remember i made the change yesterday to debug configuration on Android studio.i checked the enable advanced profiling(required for for API <26 only)  on the Profiling tab under Debug configurations.After rebuilding the project the issue issue started and when i unzipped the app-debug-apk i found the two folder armeabi-v7a and the armeabi and one was missing the libnd4jcpu.so which was what the app was complaining about  "(/vendor/lib64, /system/vendor/lib64]]] couldn\'t find "libnd4jcpu.so".    After unchecking the debug  profiling option "advanced profiling(required for for API <26 only) " and rebuild the project again and this time only armeabi-v7a folder was generated and now issue has been sorted. Am using android Studio 3.0.1,not sure why this is happening but may save guys from headache in the future.

issue: Here's a comment issue. In the code from [<-LINK->] , At line 139, which is'@paramconfThreshold Detection threshold, in range 0 (most strict) to 1 (least strict).' I think 0 is 'least strict', 1 is 'most strict', because the less confThreshold, the more DetectedObject(s)  will be found. Am i right? I've submitted an issue for this. [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: well, my data is such that instead of actual images, the pixel values are rather stored together with their respective labels. For instance a 3 channel 2x2 image data and its label may be in this form [[[1,2][3,4]][[1,2][3,4]][[1,2][3,4]]],[1,0,0] with the [1,0,0] being the label vector

issue: AlexDBlack: Thanks very much. I have been able to address my issue. 
solution: 

issue: @agibsonccc Well, it's a bad habit of mine to ask for help without searching enough for myself first. NativeImageLoader.asMatrix can take an argument of type Object containing an image, sparing all the work.Thumbs up and Thanks for help :DP.S. Mentioning YOLO was a bad idea, I don't need the YOLO functionality right now. I am NOT building YOLO from scratch. If I need to use YOLO on custom objects, I'll follow the guidelines on the YOLO site to train my own version. 
solution: 

issue: So, is there a min version of glibc required? so 2.12 won't work. I think this it why I can't get dl4j to run. You were right. I checked the open files of my thread. I found glibc 2.12 is loaded even if I pass glibc 2.14 as argument is LD_LIBRARY_PATH I was trying Only Java+ Jcuda. treo: It narrowed down to UnsatisfiedLinkError

solution:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: The thing about a "strong server", especially with multiple CPUs, is that data locality starts to matter a lot, and even if stuff is on the same numa node, caches aren\'t, and for each level of the memory hierarchy that you drop out of, you lose a lot of performance so additional threads are only useful if you can actually feed each thread with its own data 
solution: so, you're not wrong there,@tom-adsfund, in order to meaningfully saturate 24 threads, you would most likely train multiple models at once. 

issue: that's actually pretty interesting, don't think I've seen that before makes sense though 
solution: 

issue: Hello, new guy here   For questions, do I need to post a new Topic or just ask away in here? 
solution: 

issue: hi, in nd4j-examples I see only basic usage examples, I want to know if I can do a PR with a standard logistic regression implementation or if it is not the right place 
solution: fvaleri: that would be great!. i think it could be a useful way to intriduce both machine learning and nd4j. 

issue: Anyone with strong knowledge in DL4J and LSTM interested in some short-term consulting / one-on-one training? Drop me a message if you're interested.

issue: treo: Have you tried Nd4j.rot90(NDArrayToRotate); or NDArray.transposei() treo: So if I understand you correctly , this will help:NDArray array1 = (NDArray) Nd4j.zeros(1,3);array1.putScalar(0,0,0);array1.putScalar(0,1,1);array1.putScalar(0,2,2);System.out.println("Before "+ array1);System.out.println("After " + Nd4j.reverse(array1)); Output looks as follow Before [0.00,  1.00,  2.00]After [2.00,  1.00,  0.00] 
solution: 

issue: I am passing 20news-bydate-train dataset. It means I should not pass text file ? 
solution: you are probably passing it to the wrong record reader. This is I am using.RecordReader rrTrain = new FileRecordReader();rrTrain.initialize( new FileSplit(new File("pathToWriteto.txt")));DataSetIterator trainingIter = new RecordReaderDataSetIterator(rrTrain,batchSize);. 

issue: Ow I see yes, im guessing you are using it to rotate image vectors for extracting different features ? 
solution: 

issue: treo: yeah samediff will be a better fit for that Something to keep in mind there: right now samediff is cpu only :D You\'ll notice there are some neat ops in the java called "OldAddOp" and the like that's for us to continue using the old gpu ops for now till we're ready to do a transition 
solution: I\'m not looking to do anything too fancy with samediff yet, as I\'ve seen that the new ops are still in the get in right phase of "first get it right, then make it fast". 

issue: Hi , I am using HDFS  as file system, when I run a DL4J application on spark, during the application execution, I am getting an error related to spark shuffling:org.apache.spark.shuffle.MetadataFetchFailedException: Missing an output location for shuffle 0is this error is because spark  is not configured to write read and write form HDFS?

solution: 

issue: it might be also to take a look at how conceptnet does retrofitting for their numberbatch word vectors they combine data from a lot of places there and adding to the vocab is one of the things they do but it isn't with dl4j, so all of it is theoretical  (unless you want to port python code :D)

solution: 

issue: hamannTim: are you using setListeners or addListeners methods? 
solution: if you're calling that method more then once - you're overwriting prev listeners. use addListeners instead. or set listeners once. 

issue: I store an ID as a first column in input1 and input2 as a way of mapping instances (of course I don't use this ID in the data so I always tell my record reader to start from column 1). However, what I need now is when I predict I want to access this ID to print it in a file next to the predection. Is there away to access column 0 from the MultiDataSetIterator the Id is always column 0 in both inputs 
solution: hypothetically you could use dataset metadata for that. cc@AlexDBlack, he might have better ideas. 

issue: Hey I have multiple sentences as input.  Each sentence is an input sequence and within each sentence I have to label each word (n categories). There are multiple input features per word, for example the word itself and the part of speech tag, but only 1 output tag. Do suitable DataSet (and RecordReader) or DataSetIterator  classes already exist for my problem or should I develope my own versions ?

issue: Hi@AlexDBlackyes I actually do that (my csv files has the ID as column 0 and when I call the iterator I specify the start from colum 1) I was looking into that exact file you hinted now. But I got stuck trying to read the raw data. the location tells me the index of the line in each CSV file. However, I was wondering how to reproduce the record reader from the RecordReaderMultiDataSetIterator after I get the list of metadata (testData.getExampleMetaData(RecordMetaData.class)) I will have access to the location but I want to also access the class of the record reader .getReaderClass so that I read the column 0 no? Hi@AlexDBlackwhen I created the RRMDSIterator I add the readers (2 inputs) there, but I can\'t find the getRecordReaders().get("readerName") later to access the reader I can't seem to access such getter

solution: 

issue: should I take into account the timesteps? I mean.. Should minibatch % timesteps == 0? Also... I know that it is a matter of experiments and kind of problem we are trying to solve but can u tell me usually how many timesteps is a good starting point? AlexDBlack: Thank you. What about a recommended timesteps length to start experimenting with? I was a little confused with DatasetIterator (I implemented DatasetIterator before the RecordReader). I see that in RecordReader there is no param for timesteps. Does timesteps param in Iterator correspond to TBPTT? 
solution: AlexDBlack: This was my DataSetIterator implementation (before I start using RecordReader) -https://gist.github.com/svkap/69fa98763b480f899be6f0fc1c237ded. I am not sure what example I was looking at to implement it like that (I tried to find it now but I couldn't).. later if I want to predict values with neuralNet.output(INDArray) how do I implement it? How do I build the appropriate INDArray to pass it to output function and then how do I get the result? With RecordReader I have normalization -> datasetTrain.setPreProcessor(normalizer); . How do I use it with neuralNet.output(INDArray) and then how do I get the real predicted value back?. 

issue: seyah: just to weigh in on AWS Instances and you seeing only 7% utilization of your GPU: If I remember correctly, you were using a pretty small network. The problem may be that amdahl's law is crushing you there, as the GPU is finished so fast, that the serial overhead of transfering data back and forth is what is the bottleneck. In that case an expensive AWS Instance will not help you at all, it will just idle even more 
solution: yes, if network is tiny - just use cpu. or train in parallel..

issue: Is this basic logic correct. Using a DataSetIterator i can call model.fit(iterator), then iterator.reset() and then do another round of model.fit(iterator) on it? That should work? 
solution: 

issue: hi! I\'m building a LSTM with sensor data, but it doesn\'t learn (score vs iteration stays constant). I think this is because my data are not shuffled: the first 100 csv data are labeled "0", the next 100 "1" ... etc.The only way I found to shuffle the data was iterator.next().shuffle, but this shuffles only a dataSet of the size miniBachSize, right? But the miniBach will only contain one or two classes (unless I make it really big, which doesn\'T work either).Any input on shuffling ordered csv data? thank you! :) AlexDBlack:  [<-LINK->] thanks a lot for having a look!

issue: Hey@raver119I've managed to reproduce the issue in a unit test now. It seems that the issue occurs when a network is deserialized in one thread, and then the first .output on it happens in a different thread. I'm not sure it's particularly helpful for you since it uses a bunch of my helper methods, but here: [<-LINK->] interestingly, if I deserialize multiple networks, it is only the one deserialized last that exhibits the problem 
solution: most of it is in the gist I posted earlier, [<-LINK->] except there is a pre-processor on the network that does a bicubic scaling of any images to fit the input size..

issue: RuralHunter: back up a bit - what are you trying to do? Are you trying to skip using datavec for some reason? Or was there some doc page that told you to write your own datasetiterator? 
solution: Was it mnist? (I'm really tired of this, I'm tempted to just delete it :D). 

issue:  [<-LINK->] , in the first paragraph, "If your data is in CSV (Comma Seperated Values) format stored in flat files that must be converted to numeric and ingested, or your data is a directory structure of labelled images then DataVec is the tool to help you organize that data for use in DeepLearning4J". That\'s not precise right? We actually should use datavec for almost all kinds of dataset?

issue: Hi, I trained a CNN for 65 epochs and recognized that the error printed by the ScoreIterationListener was the smallest around the 35th epoch and slowly got bigger from there. But my understanding was that this shouldn't be possible with gradient decent. Can someone give me a reason for this kind of behavior? But I think overfitting wouldn't be recognizable before evaluation. The error thats calculated from using the training data should actually be smaller with overfitting

issue: Heya! Quick question. I'm fitting a model in multiple epochs. Saving a copy every epoch. The model starts at about 13mb in size. But after a while it is only 30kb Is this the result of too many epochs? sure, although I'm doing nothing special. Thinking about it. Maybe something went wrong when my laptop went in standby on my way home

issue: stephanduq: I'm not able to reproduce your issue (I've modified your code to use mnist)only other idea I have is bad tuning - the model files are a zip after all, and if all parameters converged to 0, then that would be highly compressable and hence very small file sizeanyway, keep me posted

issue: Hello, all. I am trying to get DeepLearning4J to work in a Spark cluster. Seems OK (if highly memory-hungry) but then I hit issue #4122 (Precision etc giving NaNs). I understand that the problem is fixed in the latest SNAPSHOT but there are issues getting SNAPSHOTs for the -platform JARs. Also, it appears that there have been API changes to NeuralNetConfiguration...To be brief: what should I do if I want to use -platform JARs and SNAPSHOT-0.9.2 for DeepLearning4J?When will 0.9.2 be released?Is there documentation for using the new version of NeuralNetConfiguration?

issue: Hey guys, new to this, trying to get CUDA working on my end. Seems like CUDA 9 isn't supported on the release, but is on the snapshot, correct? Not able to get thing working with the Snapshot, but a further issue may be because I'm using Gradle? ( [<-LINK->] ) 
solution: 

issue: Consider using a LSTM layer followed by an output dense layer for a classification problem with k classes. The LSTM layer gets as input data in the form (3,1,4) (3 samples, 1 time series per sample and each time series is of length 4) the output is a tensor of theform (3,10,4). Between the layers the preprocessor RNNtoFeedForward reshapes (3,10,4) to (12,10). The output layer expect an input of size=10 and the output will be of size(12, x) where x is the size of the layer. The problem is for a time series classification problem there are only 3 labels available (from the initial data) but the output layer expect 12 due to the RNN to Feed Forward change, how to approach this issue?  Is there a mistake in the logic I described?

solution: Use VAEs. 

issue: agibsonccc: I'm not familiar with the drawback of the Monte Carlo? What am I missing? 
solution: There's notthatmuch to it. a stochastic process is by definition unstable. now throw SGD on top of that stochastic process. 

issue: when I tested that earlier it did download a lot of crap, but yeah, still didn't work for my cuda 9 installation, but that's as far as I went with that route before saying f it and uninstalling 9 in favor of 8 
solution: I don\'t feel like I\'m being lazy... I just don\'t know what you mean when you say "setup your .m2"because I haven\'t used Maven for anything more than copy-paste of config files.. 

issue: In the future do you guys want to more closely follow major releases of CUDA or anything similar that comes along, so that your release branch at least works with the latest even if it doesn't necessarily offer any sort of new feature support? Then again I have zero understanding of what goes into making things work on a new CUDA version 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] those are the nd4j specific ones that downloaded for me when running the pom I posted that doesn't work for some reason 
solution: rinse and repeat for whatever you want to use and put in your .m2. 

issue: native is just what you swap with cuda right? you never want both? yeah, you mean just so they're both in his .m2 and he can toggle them in his gradle and have it work right? 
solution: cilution: gpu is used if  both are on the classpath by default unless you set some environment variables. 

issue: cuda shouldn't also be 0.9.2 snapshot?  [<-LINK->] has the same version for everything and I\'m using "nd4j-cuda-8.0"

issue: Hi, I\'d like to normalize image input subtracting the "mean" image from my dataset. It\'s quite common, eg., in Caffe models.. Is there any equivalent predefined preprocessor in DL4J? thanks, I looked at it, but I misunderstood the behaviour. I'm checking again yes, I'd like to prevent stddev normalization, but I can write a similar preprocessor To use it with a MultiDataSetIterator I need a NormalizerStrategy, not  a AbstractDataSetNormalizer .. :( 
solution: 

issue: maxpumperla: Thank you, I will have a look at it, seems to be what I need. But I have a question though,LastTimeStepLayeris only on Master but not in the 0.9.1 version right? If that is the case is there a way to use it without a local build from master?

issue: If I zero-pad the end of a character sequence, how do I mask the padded-zeros so they don't get considered for LSTM training? I've been reading various tutorials and having a hard time getting my head around it 
solution: I guess that you've seen [<-LINK->] already. 

issue: the short version of it is this: the mask array has a 1 where data is supposed to be used and a 0 where it isn't supposed to be used The padding arrays are then 2 dimensional, with shape [miniBatchSize,timeSeriesLength] 
solution: 

issue: why not translate that datawrangling into its math equivalent? 
solution: 

issue: For my part, most of my basic data wrangling happens on heap, and for the rest.condand the basic math methods are enough :) plain nd4j, and you can see it in action at [<-LINK->] well, not in action to be precise but explained :D

solution: 

issue: Can I post images here? in gitter?  [<-LINK->] Two classes, each with a main method. Both can right click in intellij and run. They both have independent purposes. Right, so I need to compile an executable that runs outside of intellij So I can produce 1 jar and just wrap in a bash script for each part or something, for convenience. 
solution: I just need to be able to run them independently outside of intellij.. 

issue: Hi, I\'m trying to preprocess ad image input to subtract the "mean image".. I tried using StandardizeStrategy. However the resulting mean vercor has shape [1,1], so I think it uses the "global" distribution of values.. I need to subtract for each pixel the mean value that pixel assumes in my dataset.. any idea? 
solution: 

issue: nhamilton1980: first tof all did you actually name your main class Program.RunStrategy? :D You need the fully qualified package name 
solution: nhamilton1980: alternatively - looks like you aren't building an uber-jar properly? i.e., your .jar file doesn't containallof the required classes?. 

issue: Hi. I've been training a classification with labels 1 and 0. When I try to test it, the output contains only [1,1]. I have read in output interpretation on dl4j doc that the output should be [1,0] or [0,1] 
solution: To be clear,here if you're using dl4j it is not magic. 

issue: could someone help me with an OutOfMemoryError?  [<-LINK->] I haven't looked into workspaces yet, but I was concerned that even though I changed -Xmx -Xms and off heap memory, the stack trace still printed the same thing Ah! I got it! Thank you!

solution: 

issue: org.nd4j:nd4j-cuda-9.1:jar:linux-ppc64le:0.9.2-SNAPSHOTnot found- which is reasonable since it doesn't exist- what is calling that as a dependency? also i'm on linux-x86_64 (verified withuname -m) if i add a classifier to cuda-9.1-platform? (answer is no- it still wants the ppcle one) ok - i just deleted the ppcle line out of the downloaded pom, and that seemed to get me through it idk if you want me to file an issue on that? 
solution: 

issue: rawkintrevo: I'm going to need a lot more than that... got some code I can look at? 
solution: 

issue: 1) that depends on your real task. i.e. that can be case of hierarchic labelling and multi-task learning for example. or you can just throw away roses, since you don't need that category at all. depends on your task. 2) there\'s no such thing as "max number of labels" there are hardware limitations. i.e. ImageNet has approx 1000 categories 3) 50 images per label is NOT ok.

issue: i am trying to build a chatbot, similar to the ones from tensorflow, can you help me with some documents or starting point? 
solution: 

issue: is there a way to get/set individual elements in an INDArray using it's coordinate? For example in numpy, you can just subscript in like a[0][0] = 1337. I've seen the .get/.put methods, but I can't find NDArrayIndex representations that represent a single element. 
solution: jszym: you are probably looking for.putScalar. 

issue: @Ngosti2000could you please try to build your classifier project now, it should work. 
solution: 

issue: hi, is there anybody here who managed to use ND4J for an Android App? I manage to make the proper declarations on the build.gradle files and the App starts but when it comes to any Nd4j.method the app crashes so not even .zeros .ones or .create work for me  [<-LINK->] not sure where I should get this, from the logcat of androidstudio I guess yes, I was right. Here it goes: [<-LINK->] any idea what could be the problem? 
solution: 

issue: mvidaldp: what's up? show your gradle conf and your crash message and crash log? 
solution: 

issue: Several points here: 1. Snapshots change multiple times per day.  2. All your dl4j dependencies should use the same version so that should have already told you that you can't use nd4j-jblas 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: ,@treo,@raver119, what about my issue? any ideas why ND4J is not working on my Android app? [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: mvidaldp:  [<-LINK->] looks like the .so files are not in your APK 
solution: 

issue: saudet: how can achieve that? I followed all the instructions from the site can it be related to what\'s explained on this paragraph? (I didn\'t check it yet) "And now, press Sync Now to update the project. Finally, make sure that your APK doesn\'t contain both lib/armeabi and lib/armeabi-v7a subdirectories. If it does, move all files to one or the other as some Android devices will have problems with both present." 
solution: 

issue: Since I asked the same question yesterday, is it documented anywhere as I might oversee? Actually I did have a check but couldn't find it. That's why I asked here yesterday. I checked the javadoc and here: [<-LINK->] but they don't have the explain. I suggest document it in javadoc at least since it's the first place I would look I can open an issue if it's appropriate. 
solution: 

issue: Hi, yesterday I opened an issue at github: [<-ISSUE->] regarding the calculation of the F1 score and other evaluation scores by DL4J. It's not an exciting issue, but could someone please have a look at it? 
solution: 

issue: zys199029: I assume you are using snapshots? (i.e., version 0.9.2-SNAPSHOT) 
solution: AlexDBlack: not snapshots. DL4J+eclipse+no maven. howexactlyare you managing dependencies?. zys199029: it's 2018 now. there's lots of transitive dependencies you're missing. 

issue: that looks like failed temporary allocation within nativeop i'll file corresponding issue :) 
solution: 

issue: that's great news :) any idea what it might be called more-or-less? From [<-LINK->] in the generated docs of INDArray, none of the function descriptions really seem to me like they do that... but I could be looking at the wrong place :) 
solution: 

issue: Is there a tutorial for making a new intellij project with all the dl4j libs? via maven? I can't find one not using examples project 
solution: I have, didnt check videos thoug. 

issue: MaxLeiter: If you don't need the logger, then it's no problem to run w/o it (it's what I'm doing now in my dev environment) 
solution: 

issue: hmm I think I've messed something up :pScore at iteration 0 is -3.8583221435546875Test set evaluation at epoch 0: Accuracy = 1.00, F1 = NaN 
solution: 

issue: there isn't a way to do net.evaluate(DataSet) right? only iterators? No easy way to wrap a single DataSet into an iterator? oh, perfect thanks would be convenient to have an overload to evaluate that does that feel like I'm making some progress in understanding things at least, though no idea why my score is negative in the evaluation 
solution: 

issue:  [<-LINK->] Could anyone assist me in solving this problem? Thank you! 
solution: 

issue: must have missed that, was it a while ago? can dig through the history here's what I'm using, with the disclaimer that it is pretty much taken straight from an example that may not be applicable to the sort of data I'm trying to put into it: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: random question, if your data is normalized going in, but you want a value like a price prediction out, how is that handled? you've been a lot of help, I'll just study up more on network configurations specific to regression 
solution: 

issue: the normalizer has a "restore" you can use to expand it back That's specifically for normalized labels for input it doesn't matter 
solution: perfect. guessing it is revert, don't see restore. 

issue: Hi, i want to train my network with rnn, i have gone through the GravesLSTm examples but my data is wav files. i am stuck in the preprocessing stage, or preparing a wav file data to be trained.  i have tried using the WavFileRecordReader but no much example of its usage. i need help on this. 
solution: 

issue: Noob question I'm sure, but where is predictions coming from? [<-CODE->] Not sure how to fix that, my features/labels are rank 3 
solution: 

issue: any one can give me any like of my requirement  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Commands are: gist; examples; book; issue; tuning; docs; start; persist; javafx; workspaces; qq; snapshot; spark; memory; eval; features; Put ! before any of those commands to be accepted 
solution: 

issue: ah that's all it is, yeah I should already be using the cuda backend.. so was the GravesLSTM not using GPU acceleration or just slower with it? 
solution: 

issue: specifically need v6 right? 7.1 on the cudnn page will not work, just like cuda 9 is unsupported on the release branch? added it to my cuda 8 bin folder, any way to verify that dl4j is actually using cudnn now? 
solution: cudnn is special thing :). 

issue: got link to numpy doc? there's Nd4j.pullRows method plus on current master there's gather and gathernd or, obviously, INDArray.get(indices) 
solution: 

issue: how much actualFREERAM do you have? i.e. do you actually have 8G to use? as you've been told yesterday, if I remember correctly, that error means basically that the OS can't provide the requested memory 
solution: Also, I think@raver119actually created an issue (it could be this one [<-ISSUE->] ), but as I understand this, it is mostly to create a more informative error message in this case. The problem is probably still the same, and being on SNAPSHOT you are probably running into a case of bad luck where new ops are used that don't yet cause the normal OOM message to appear. 

issue: hi guys, I'm trying to run ND4J on Android for days and although I can compile and run the App, when it comes to instantiate a INDArray and/or use any ND4J method my app crashes with the next errors: [<-LINK->] my build.gradle file: [<-LINK->] any ideas? 
solution: 

issue: Somewhat@chrisvnicholson, the problem is there’s a lot of unnecessary libs there and it’s hard to judge what’s what 
solution: 

issue: cilution: yeah, your most recent code looks quite wrongyou should be normalizing based onyour entire training setnot just based on a single exampleyou can save and load normalizers using the methods on ModelSerializer MaxLeiter: for minimal set of dependencies: deeplearning4j-core and nd4j-native-platform (or nd4j-native-cuda-8.0 for CUDA) (and I guess logback for logging)most everything else is optional 
solution: 

issue: Hi How are you? I wanted to ask how can I check the new NeuralNetConfiguration.Builder() configurations that is used by 0.9.2-SNAPSHOT I am using 0.9.1 and iterations, regularization and learningRate are not there anymore. 
solution: 

issue: hey alex trying to add a conv layer to the thing I built yesterday following this example .addLayer("cnn3", new ConvolutionLayer.Builder()\n                .kernelSize(3,vectorSize)\n                .stride(1,vectorSize)\n                .nIn(1)\n                .nOut(cnnLayerFeatureMaps)\n                .build(), "input") but when I do.kernelsize()in intellij it says the method isn't found but there is a get and set method using 0.9.1 just use setter? 
solution: 

issue: ok got conv1d going thanks 
solution: 

issue: well, yeah, ok. Saying it's thefractionwould be cleareropen an !issue and we'll fix that

[<-LINK->] To use gist: paste your code/exception/large output log into [<-LINK->] , click 'Create Secret Gist' and paste URL link here 
solution: 

issue: bimboslaff: I assume you're running a toy benchmark with no understanding of the nd4j internals or how to configure it? :D The matrices are probably really small with tons of allocations etc The proper way to ask that question would be to post your code so we can tell you what to configure 
solution: 

issue: bimboslaff: from a first look, it may be that the jvm actually optimizes your loop away microbenchmarks like this are hard to get right, there is a reason why JMH exists 
solution: 

issue: also, if you actually initialize the double array with random numbers, it's about 5 times slower 
solution: 

issue: So, for example, my program is spending like 15% of time on .putRow line. Yes, this piece of code is called a lot (it is creating input data for neural network), but still, it should not take longer than network computation itself, right?  [<-LINK->] Am i using it wrongM *? 
solution: 

issue: Hi. I am new in the topic, so please forgive me difficulty of the question. I am building my first NN and it is about classification. I have 3 possible classes of output. Can I somehow easily using datavec to map my possible outputs to vectors? So ideally it would be [1,0,0], [0,1,0] and [0,0,1].  I could do it manually but would be nice to have such simple convertion automated Do I need to use Spark stuff to do that? It's looks like big overkill for this operation

issue: rnnClearPreviousState(） will clear the weight? 2.how can I get the train error(MSE or RMSE)?  3. WeightInitdoesn't contains orthogonal? 4.why  I can't see the source code of function  rnnClearPreviousState(）and rnnGetPreviousState() except an interface? 
solution: 

issue: I'm not very familiar with the piece of code itself that you are referring to, but in general, that kind of thinking may very well lead to actually slower computation in many cases calculating some unused values may be a lot faster than branch misspredictions and memory fetches I guess you can raise an !issue, with that idea, and then it can be discussed with some more details 
solution: 

issue: Hi! Quick question: the docs indicate that Sparse matrices aren't quite supported yet, but from looking [<-ISSUE->] it looks like there might be something landed in Snapshots? 
solution: jszym: it's more like alpha-version there. after next release - we'll add full support. 

issue: Hi, I\'m new to dl4j and I\'m having a problem with what i guess is the shape of my input features. I\'m trying to run a RNN model, based on UCISequenceClassification however my input data has 2 columns while the label files just have one number. I\'m getting the error"Received input with size(1) = 2 (input array shape = [286, 2, 286]); input.size(1) must match layer nIn size (nIn = 286)"Here is the gist [<-LINK->] Any idea how to solve this? agibsonccc: how so? sorry, pretty new  to this :/ Came from pytorch and tensorflow, about two months ago. Guess i'm not reading the code right. Thank you :) yes! it made sense, i wasn't familiar with this in java. a bit different but refreshing.Thank you, i think its going to work once i change it :)

issue: hi - what are the alternatives to using a global pooling layer for connecting an lstm layer to an OutputLayer? I'd like to densely connect the output of the lstm but when I add a denselayer after it gives me mismatched shapes errors I've looked into preprocessors but this appears to be getting handled by the setInputTypes part of the build as indicated by the docs 
solution: 

issue: Hez guys, am I right to assume that the [<-LINK->] example actually uses the [<-LINK->] implementation? I.e., the inference model recursively corrects the generative distribution with a data dependent approximate likelihood term? 
solution: no, it's definitelynota LVAE... we don't have an implementation of that in DL4Jit's just standard variational autoencoder. 

issue: sir, i know Deepleanring4j uses XENT loss function and Sigmoid output layer activation function to implement multi-label classification. What is the principle? Are there  any introduction about this? 
solution: 

issue: Is this a place to talk about Java? like questions and stuff. Sorry, im new to gitter 
solution: 

issue: so this is a sequence to sequence model, by the sound of ittypically (as per say the seq2seq addition example) you wouldn\'t use padding like that - but I think it should work, thinking about it nowanyway, in the "typical" approach you\'d have 2 inputs - [minibatch,5,22] and [minibatch,1,10] and 1 output [minibatch,1,10]the second input and labels would be the same - except that the second input would be offset by 1 step vs. the label (why? it\'s essentially like feeding in the last time step\'s output/prediction) I think it should work, thinking about it now it's certainly a simpler approach to implement right. Maskingdoesimpact scores - as it should 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: "Masking does impact scores" understood but is there any special thing that needs to be done in dl4j to tweak ScoreIterationListener() to work properly with padding/masking? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: @treoHi, would you have a spare moment to take a look at [<-ISSUE->] ? Without your help I am pretty much stuck, and can't use DL4j for production deployment. 
solution: 

issue: treo: actually, he wants to build a sequence to sequence model jvence: I'm not sure what you are asking here... is there a question in there (beyond youroriginalquestion that I've already responded to?) 
solution: and labelsMask only last column=1That's why I thought he cares only about the last step. 

issue: Hello to everybody.  I have a question about word embeddings. How is it possible to finetune pre-trained embeddings in tasks such as sentence classification? It seems to me that they can be lonly used but not fine-tuned during the training for a specific natural language task. Is it correct ? 
solution: embedding layer. 

issue: Good info@AlexDBlackI just needed some 0.9.2 examples for a possible issue Im having, thx :) 
solution: Have ndarray something like get index of max value?. 

issue: Hey @raver120, are you around?I\'m still having the issue I mentioned yesterday, in case you have a minute. "P.A.N.I.C.!

solution: 

issue: I'm having problems with displaying my neural net using the UI interface deeplearning4j provides Could anyone help? 
solution: 

issue: again, I'd start with moving the threshold. It's quick, simple and robust.but if youreallywant to incorporate it into the training: weighted loss functions can do that to a degree (we have an example), but it's arguably not as theoretically well studied as other approachesalternatively under/over sampling is also possible (don't have great support for that in DL4J/DataVec)finally, an anomaly detection approach might work (train say VAEonlyon A or B - and look for outliers) 
solution: but it's arguably not as theoretically well studied as other approachesDoes it have a fancy name I can use to search for it? I would like to know what other approaches there arealternatively under/over sampling is also possibleIn that case I would need to undersample A so that the net tends to put everything in B, right?anomaly detection approach might work (train say VAE only on A or B - and look for outliers)Don't know what you're talking about, I'll do more research on that. Does it have a fancy nameusually it\'s just "threshold moving" - google that (along with the term "class imbalance") and you should find plentyundersample Ayes, if you undersample A it should bias the net toward predicting B. You\'re introducing another hyperparameter though (i.e., degree of undersampling) so be careful with how you evaluate your netDon\'t know what you\'re talking aboutgoogle anomaly detection... also http://dm.snu.ac.kr/static/docs/TR/SNUDM-TR-2015-03.pdf and https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples/blob/master/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/feedforward/anomalydetection/VaeMNISTAnomaly.java. 

issue: btw, it would be really really nice if LocalFileModelSaver saves and loads the normalizer as well. I think it's a must have when using a model after training right? I'm using it through EarlyStopping, but it forgot the normalizer! in fact I don't know why it isn't part of the model bin file. Why would you like to not save/restore it anyway?

solution: because I was always reading about researchers having to resort to re-ranking approaches because calculating the cosine similarity to for each query and each document was too slow... so I set out to find a faster way, and found that a naive implementation sucks, but if done properly it is orders of magnitude faster than anything else.

Is converting them to 0 and 1 sufficient? I find on the dl4j doc (but nowhere in the exemples) that they should be vectors like [0,1] and [1,0]. Or do I have to use datavec and build an  inputDataSchema with .addColumnCategorical("Sex", Arrays.asList("male","female"))?

solution: 

issue: Just to clarify things up for DataSetIterator (javadoc is kind off reduced).Let me assume given data of shape collection with arrays of vectors as entries.The Vectors are input to the network, and each array builds a timeseries.My target consists of 3 classes (0,1,2).BatchSize=2C(A_1(v_1(i_1, ..., i_4), ..., v_k(i_1, ..., i_4)),A_2(v_1(i_1, ..., i_4), ..., v_k(i_1, ..., i_4)),A_3(v_1(i_1, ..., i_4), ..., v_k(i_1, ..., i_4)), <- current position...,A_l(v_1(i_1, ..., i_4), ..., v_k(i_1, ..., i_4)))Are this the intended return values of the methods to be overridden in DataSetIterator!?:next(2) -> DataSet of A_5 and A_6totalExamples() -> linputColumns() -> 4totalOutcomes() -> 3batch() -> 2cursor() -> 3numExamples() -> 2Since it is working, it cann't be all wrong, but I'm not quite sure if all of the data is used properly. 
solution: 

issue: @Br0ce looks about right. Many of those methods aren't even used any more anywhere, if I remember correctly.@Loewave When using it in a simple MLP you don't have to specify inputs, that is only required when using comp graph. You would be adding it at the point in your mlp where you want to go from RNN to normal Feed forward, that also means that you would be using a regular OutputLayer instead of RNNOutputLayer ankitaa89: you seem to be in way over your head. You can't just skip all of machine learning and expect magic to happen by adding a dependency. 
solution: 

issue: treo: So I don't have to use the RNNOutputLayer but instead just add a GlobalPoolingLayer directly after the GravesLSTMLayer? Yeah, I\'ve got it. But I mean because I\'ll be adding a denseLayer after the GlobalPoolingLayer and then after the denseLayer a "normal" output layer, I\'m not supposed to have a RNNOutputLayer anywhere in my network? 
solution: So what do I need the GlobalPoolingLayer for? Can't I just connect the LSTM directly to the DenseLayer - or is there some specific reason behind it?. 

issue: imagine integer space: 0....10. that means arbiter will try all values between 0 and 10 and arbiter does that in parallel

Why not use the native backend for that? You're uploading your data to the gpu whenever you do that what you're basically doing is loading them in to the gpu, doing nothing, then copying it back down on top of that you're loading more and more in to memory and it's spilling over in to cpu space 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: I didn't realize it was using the GPU until I saw that the task manager was blipping the GPU and saw it using the memory. I'm definitely not training yet though. I would be getting a decent load on int. I haven't looked deeply into the Word2Vec code. You're sure that getWordVectors() doesn't get any benefit from using the GPU? I wouldn't think the Tokenizer would be doing it I've never seen the ETL take this long either. If I comment out all the code dealing with the tokenizer and WordVectors, it's decently quick. I'll check out that link though 
solution: 

issue: webegit1234: if you can share your code as a !gist, we can probably also tell you where you are doing things the wrong way.  Or if you can't, you should be able to see what takes the most time using a profiler. I guess, just like@agibsonccc, that you are mostly stuck on moving data back and forth. But as you said that you are still in the constructor of your iterator, I think you might be doing something that is very suboptimal 
solution: 

issue: Maybe this means that a dropout layer is trained at each backpropagation, while dropout on a layer simply erases some weights stochastically? 
solution: there is basically no difference, but you can't set a dropout on everything that you might configure on a computation graph, in that case you'll use a dropout layer afterwards.

issue: Thanks@treo. Got confused by a  beginner example that specifies a mini batch size in the RecordReaderDataSetIterator, and then continues to work with a DataSet using SplitTestAndTrain, ending up with running the DataSet fit method on the training set. Given your response, this means that the mini batch size set in the DataSetIterator here is ignored, and thus unnecessary, right?

issue: I have learned several things about rnn, completed 2,3 tutorials but I still don\'t get what is going on in "BasicRNNExample".

This is the only way I'm seeing it right now but I cannot belive that this would be true? treo: i see thanks. easy explanation treo: but why is the score still decreasing while the string is guessed correctly? I mean, it can't get any more acurate?

solution: 

issue: jef5ez: trying to figure out the root of this proble, will let you know once I get some info... 
solution: 

issue: it looks like you were maybe going to split datasets.iterator.impl out of deeplearning4j-core into a new module but it somehow got mixed into another commit?  [<-ISSUE->] it was added today in this [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: I think what happened there was one of those "I have it cached locally works fine for me" situations. 

issue: Hi, I'm trying to change momentum to a NeuralNetConfiguration.  If I invoke the momentum(<dbl>) method it works but netBeans tell me that is deprecated ...  :( ... but here is not deprecated:  [<-LINK->] ... I'm confused ... 
solution: 

issue: well, just trying stuff isn't a good strategy - see !tuningas for regression vs. classification: classification is more common in practice, but regression is still widely used and can work well in many cases 
solution: 

issue: should I use Word2VecModel to read the vectors then? (as loadStatic doesn't seem to like it) I made my own vocab parser, so I can have the wordcount and I seem to be able to work with W2VM 
solution: yes, your vectors.txt is the same csv file w2v models usually have.

issue: Hi, I have found this TF example:  [<-LINK->] I'm trying to convert the x*sin(x) in DL4J but I can't obtain any learning from LSTM-NN.  But I have obtained previously the same results with sin(x) 
solution: 

issue: you could just use current !snapshots, and import tf graph. 
solution: 1 command is triggering at least 20 or more times. 

issue: Commands are: gist; examples; book; issue; tuning; docs; start; persist; javafx; workspaces; qq; snapshot; spark; memory; eval; features; Put ! before any of those commands to be accepted 
solution: 

issue: You can enable Nan panic to see where they come from 
solution: 

issue: I'm trying to run dl4j-benchmark with the latest snapshots and am getting told that I have no backend enabled. It should be depending on nd4j-native linux-x85_64 but i'm not seeing any class files in the shaded jar, only the pom for that module. 
solution: 

issue: How much overlap is thate between the labels? In my case I had 173 labels, and my minibatch had to be at least 182 in size to have at least one example for each label the problem is pretty much that if you don't have a positive example for a label, the gradient will be pointing into the direction that the label isneverpositive and that's certainly not something that you want (also the reason for your NaN) 
solution: Also you can do it, that way, but you will require a very small learning rate, and probably a bit of regularization out of the gate. treo: mhh... I already use regularization, but I haven't tried learning rates lower than 1e-5. 

issue: Can you... add a fake input at the end of the minibatch that when 1 activates all outputs? 
solution: 

issue: anyone got dl4j via gradle to work? 
solution: 

issue: PatwinchIR: yes it works fine on stable..what's the exact issue your'e running in to? you really need to be more specific, is it android problems? Is it a dependency issue? 
solution: bjonnh: i don't remember, sorry. but since it's all open source you could just check it out.. as i remember it should be something around mean/sum as diff. 

issue: treo: I can't believe I only just saw your message about tom's loss..... I guess it was because it was a PM thanks v much 
solution: PatwinchIR: Yes (with Kotlin though). 

issue: agibsonccc: sorry for my general description, I added the instruction shown on the quickstart for gradle in mybuild.gradle, but it built failed and says the module doesn't exist 
solution: Then I add the lineimport org.deeplearning4j.models;, but gradle throws a build error that this does not exist. I even tried with0.9.1. 

issue: could someone explain where the features used in the convolutional neural network come from? I know that the weights and biases are randomly set, but i know the features are not (because back prop and gradient descent do not affect the features directly, as they only change the weights and biases) 
solution: 

issue: it a well know issue when using sbt, gradle or anything not maven with snapshot some deps / trans deps arent downloaded correctly use maven if you dont want any trouble or be prepared to hack around 
solution: 

issue: alexpalman: try again, it now uses release version of openblas 
solution: 

issue: how do i determine what filters I want to use in my CNN? If i do not define them in my build, then will they be random filters?  [<-LINK->] this is my current cnn w/o defining the  filters 
solution: in the convolution layer, how can i assign a set of predetermined filters that I want to use on the input images. or are the filters always randomly assigned to begin with?. 

issue: Hi! I'm new to ND4J and have looked through the docs, but can't seem to find a way to export an INDArray to CSV or JSON. Any tips/pointers? This is exactly what I'm looking for thank you! Ok so I tried using Nd4jBase64.base64String() and I had a different expectations for its function. What I am trying to do is take an INDArray and export its raw values out to a CSV file so that I can plot it with matplotlib. Does base64String() return the base64 value of the INDArray object or of the primitive values in the array? wmeddie: hmm ok. Is there a standard way of exporting data for cross platform use with ND4J?

issue: are the 1.0.0-alpha artifacts available anywhere right now? 
solution: 

issue: With  such very tiny matrices it may be faster to stay in Java. In any case you shouldn't have any allocations in a tight loop. Last time I benchmarked matrix multiplication it took less then 1000ns until you get into the region of about 20x20 sized matrices Moving data back and forth isn't cheap

solution: kandekar: that's because the main dl4j spark implementation is different from the nlp docs. 

issue: yes, primarily because only limited amount of companies (!!!) might ever need it on spark not private persons our spark impl was made with sharding in mind for cases when you just can't fit model into single box ram in this case it's not about speed/perf yes, i think draft was there. same engine etc, different learner but it;s been a while since i've touched it

issue: Hi Guys. I have been looking into why I keep getting NaNs in my loss for TSNE. On my first iteration, when computeEdgeForces, in this.data I have some [0.0,0.0] which makes this.buf = [0.0,0.0]. Then D=Nd4j,getBlasWrapper().dot(this.buf,this.buf) = infinity and that value goes in posF as a NaN. this.data does not come from my data It is randomly generated And it comes from Y in BarnesHutTsne

issue:  [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->] could work 
solution: 

issue: Hi what is the NDArray format for a batch of images? Is it [width, height, depth, imagenumber]? Can't seem to find it anywhere in the dl4j documentation [imagenumber, width, height, depth] makes most sense imo but can anyone confirm? 
solution: imagenumber, depth, height, width. however,  NHWC is supported at libnd4j/samediff level.. 

issue: We may have a 1.0 casualty in the examples. The NeuralStyleTransfer example: deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples#659Easy to reproduce. May be worth a look. 
solution: 

issue: Is DynamicCustomOp only in the 1.0.0 alpha? 
solution: yeah.

solution: 

issue: Hello, quick installation question regarding dl4j, I\'m looking at [<-LINK->] and I\'ve downloaded the 4 requirements. I\'m new to Java so I\'m not even familiar with how Java packages are installed in general. I\'m used to Python where you\'d get a package by doing something like "pip install package" and then you can use it in the future by simply doing "import package" do Java packages work the same way? hmmm ok 
solution: 

issue: One more question, without spark, how do I get from my CSVRecordReader to a  List<List<Writable>>? All the examples use spark methods which I can't find an alternative for 
solution: you're treating this like you're climbing a mountain, just follow the tutorials I linked you step by step and come back if you have specific problems. 

issue: So dl4j is more geared towards deployment? dunno, my background in research is in fortran lol I thought I saw a fairly recent interview with professor Hinton in which he was still talking about RBMs and their power...I was not aware that they were effectively "dead" D: 
solution: every time someone came through trying to use it it was because they didn't know any better. 

issue: Hi@AlexDBlackin 1.0.0-alpha fit(DataSetIterator) does not pretrain you need to manually do pretrain(DataSetIterator) ,  but does fit(DataSet)  include the pretrain? since there is no pretrain(DataSet) method ? 
solution: 

issue: Hello! When RnnOutputLayer makes prediction it uses all timesteps from previous layer or only last step?

issue: Is there way to deal with a CSV that has empty strings (where numerical values would be)? Or is it easiest to just replace all the empty cells in the CSV with 0.0? I thought allowing NaN would work but it still gives me number format exceptions while transforming Never mind... I assume the new transform process has the right method somewhere 
solution: 

issue: Quick Q: is it ok to reuse aMultiLayerNetwork? If I want to restart training, can I just callMultiLayerNetwork.initto reset and start from scratch? Or do I need to get a new instance? 
solution: 

issue: is this on 1.0 alpha or 0.9.1? 
solution: 

issue: raver119: the methods are void so when I try to add them it says that you can't use a void method to create the builder (which makes sense in a way :/ ) ? raver119: my bad ! eclipse just showed me the setter not the actual method can I use the workspace single option for both of them ? or does this require to much memory then? 
solution: scto1022: that depends on lots of factors. try it and you'll know. 

issue: I learned the autodiff in nd4j.  Is there examples in dl4j about autodiff? I use 1.0.0-alpha deeplearning4j-core/src/test/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/layers/samediff/testlayers/MinimalSameDiffDense.java ? AlexDBlack: thanks so，samediff layers can not work with other layers?  (i.e., layer（1）is emmbedding layer and layer(2) is samediff layer ) 
solution: 

issue: guys, I'm a scientist, I am not afraid of challenge

solution: 

issue: hi This is not getting compiled.. .updater(new Adam(2e-2)) 
solution: 

issue: I don\'t think the LogSoftMax op uses the "correct" fomula, as described by tensorflow [<-LINK->] or by pytorch code [<-LINK->] That formula is crucial for not getting NaNs.So the process of implementing my own activation/loss is to implement IActivation and ILossFunction and then I can pass them to my model, correct? org.nd4j.linalg.api.ops.impl.transforms.LogSoftMax appears to be implemented asNd4j.getExecutioner().exec(new OldSoftMax(x, z));Transforms.log(z, false); at least it says that in exec maybe I understand this wrong somehow from what I understand LogSoftmax in pytorch is somehow implemented in a different way, which makes the difference between NaNs due to numerical instability or not for my network. Just doing log on the output of a softmax causes NaNs in my pytorch code, using LogSoftmax works fine. I am seeing the NaNs in my dl4j implementation 
solution: OldLogSoftMax does not appear to be in my classpath. 

issue: I am using dl4j with spark and scala.  I can't sort out how to get dl4j to use my graphics card. [<-LINK->] describes how to change a pom file, but I have a build.sbt not a pom file. Could somebody describe to me how to get dl4j to use a graphics card in scala and build.sbt? 
solution: 

issue: it should be the same as using nd4j-nativein your sbt file, but using nd4j-cuda-x.x instead (where x.x is the cuda version) 
solution: 

issue: One other thing to improve training would be to use NCE instead of hierarchical softmax (this will also scale better). Is there already a ticket for this? I'm not seeing one in the search but just confirming before I file another ticket  [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: amoellmann: pretty sure we haven't mapped it with a convenience method at the ND4J/java level yet, but we do have an implementation at the c++ level that you can access (as of version 1.0.0-alpha) using the following: [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: I have followed BasicDataVecExampleLocal.java to do encoding and could see it can do a lot of different types of transformation and filtering. However, I am looking for a way to auto encode a Category name without supplying explicit list of state names. Is there anyway I can do this in deepleaning4j? 
solution: 

issue: so multiple inputs? [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: thanks, we have some wav file and we would like to perform some convolution and subsampling on it, the goal is to send the result into a classifier to find the gender of the speaker.We are just starting and got 3 layers  :layer(0, new Convolution1DLayer.Builder()).layer(1, new Subsampling1DLayer.Builder(Subsampling1DLayer.PoolingType.MAX).layer(2, new OutputLayer.Builder(LossFunctions.LossFunction.NEGATIVELOGLIKELIHOOD)i can send the whole code if you want 
solution: 

issue: Have I used Nd4j here correctly to implement that LogSoftmax formula? [<-LINK->] 
solution: for sum, and subsequent operations. I wasn\'t quite sure from the javadoc, it says "Returns the sum along the last dimension of this ndarray". 

issue: I upgraded from 0.9.1 to 1.0.0-alpha, but it is 4 times slower on the same network.. is it possible? now I process only 90 images/sec on a GTX 1070, with 0.9.1 I worked at 300-310 images per second

issue: marioarrigonineri: make sure to use 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT 
solution: i know it's few days since alex started on it. 

issue: hi, does dl4j support GAN directly? I mean writing a GAN model by dl4j's api, not import keras model. i tried the case code of GAN in your documentation, but it appers does not work. the error says: "Unsupported keras layer type Model" 
solution: For DL4J issues, click 'New Issue' at [<-LINK->] - for ND4J, use [<-LINK->] instead. 

issue: HI, I hope you are doing well. I am having a strange issue in my csv file I have the first column (index 0) as an ID (string value)  and in my RecordReaderMultiDataSetIterator I set the reader to start from column index 1.

Its with a kernel size of 2 of course, am just searchig how to paste it properly  [<-CODE->] thanks a lot, i never found a working  example with a convolution1Dlayer so your help is greatly appreciated thanks, its working for this dataset with .kernelSize(3) and .padding(1). I will now try to add a Subsampling1DLayer. 
solution: 

issue: Is it possible that the docs under [<-LINK->] are outdated? There does not seem to be anyiterations()for theNeuralNetConfiguration.Builder()anymore in1.0.0-alpha. 
solution: I always feel stupid if I file an issue, and it turns out to be my own stupidity. So asking in here seemed a better start. Anyway, [<-ISSUE->]. 

issue: If someone got time to help us with our issue, we are totally stuck with our Mismatched shapes.(shape = [200, 6], row vector shape =[600, 1]).

solution: 

issue: what version of cuda was supported for 0.9.1? I am trying to test the older version of dl4j, since it seems the cuda backend has one or more severe bugs and I want to test if they show up in the versions before 1.0 but cant build the project because maven cannot find deeplearning4j-cuda-8.0-0.9.1.jar 
solution: 

issue: ColaColin: anymore info you'd have would help us fix it I'm not sure where the team is currently, but I know we've been working on most of it and I believe are further along now. it should be fixed in the next few weeks but more input before that happens (even if redundant) would be great ranbo: that's a really broad question it's hard to tell what specific java process you are trying to run but in general you likely made a mistake with intellij somewhere Output isn't magic. You can't just set an arbitrary output and expect it to work. You need to calculate the actual output shape you can do that with op.calculateOutputShape() allocate the ndarrays accordingly 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: Shouldn't the output be a N x N matrix if the input is N x N? In an example where the input is 6 x 6, op.calculateOutputShape() returns [6, 6, 6, 1] for the dimension. Maybe my understanding is wrong. 
solution:

And how can I get the averaged f1 score, recall, accuracy of both positive and negative classes. 
solution: 

issue: Actually for Turkish, i can change some parts of code and contrubute Actually first i want to debug and try to understand how does it work 
solution: 

issue: That's common problem with workspaces for now The solution will be to shuffle the pictures, and then perform several epochs with an amount of pictures that is enough to train Not that. I didn't work with the concrete examples of dl4j for a while, but I've experienced that you cannot load all the pictures into the memory

But upon fixing that, and running again the code, the aforementioned error pops up. So far, I have done NO modification to this example. It is exactly as it is on GitHub. 

issue: raver119: please excuse my stupidity, but how do I import it as a Maven Project? :"( 
solution: JAAT2000: once you open project in intellij, there's popup balloon shows up. 

issue: So I guess I got it....I'm seeing this window where it has this window where it says DeepLearning4j Examples, and then below it LifeCycle, and then below that it lists the following: clean, validate, compile,test, package, verify, install, site, deploy. What should I click? AlexDBlack: That’s what I initially did, but this error popped up 
solution: 

issue: when mvn -U package, throws "org.deeplearning4j:deeplearning4j-nn:jar:0.9.2-SNAPSHOT -> org.threadly:threadly:jar:${threadly.version}: Failed to read artifact descriptor for org.threadly:threadly:jar:${threadly.version}" Load simple neural model from keras's 'model.save'. Do predictions with dl4j's ComputationGraph. I try to change dl4j and nd4j\'s version both from 0.9.2-SNAPSHOT to 1.0.0-alpha. But the repositories dir looks like this "_remote.repositories                                   deeplearning4j-modelimport-1.0.0-alpha.pomdeeplearning4j-modelimport-1.0.0-alpha.jar.lastUpdated deeplearning4j-modelimport-1.0.0-alpha.pom.lastUpdated" 
solution: 

issue: @AlexDBlack @agibsonccc  Finally!@lhdgriver is there a reason you are trying to build (a now outdated) version of DL4J from source instead of using the pre-built artifacts on maven central?I think  "outdated" is THE reason. So I updated to 1.0.0-alpha. But the maven central --> company\'s central repo --> my local repo needs some time.. So I wait a moment, and everything is fine with 1.0.0-alpha. Thank you guys. 
solution: 

issue: Hi guys - as great as ND4J is, I cannot understand why arrays can only be sized and indexed with ints. I want to adopt it but my API uses longs for all indexing. Is this being discussed, or is there an alternative long-based API that I'm too dumb to find? 
solution: 

issue: squallyou: so you never tried snapshots? keras 2 was a known problem ah yeah I was going to say keras 2 was a known issue 
solution: yeah I googled it and found keras 2 issue. and I only browsed the deeplearning4j.org roughly, and found no detailed info about it. my problem.. 

issue: Hey, did anyone work on using RnntoFeedForward preprocessors to build computational graphs? 
solution: Post a !gist of your stack trace and usage instead.. manaswiv: here’s an example [<-LINK->]. Usually when folks ask for an example of something it's because they have existing code :D. 

issue: Hi, just wanted to know if there was a fix for [<-ISSUE->] . It\'s a shape problem during the "Flatten". Some other issues are related to this one and Flatten is a must have when using the Keras Functional API.Thx

issue: Hi, I am trying to solve a problem using DL4J, is there a way to reward the network for outputting a uniform distribution? My labels are binary, either 0 or 1, though it would be suitable if the trained outputs are continuous between 0 and 1 follow a uniform distribution. 
solution: 

issue: What is the minimum version of GLIBC to run 1.0.0-alpha? 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: Seems like my hobby-hacking hours does not overlap with this chat :) Here is the code I use for caching DataSets: [<-LINK->] . I had to add the migrate method to avoid leaked workspace exception when training. AlexDBlack: After having looked at it a bit more, it might be an issue with the labels. I'm using a ComputationGraph and I see that the program enters line 1649 (vertices[vIdx].migrateInput()). At this point however, labels are not set in the output layer so they are not migrated. Gist with exception: [<-LINK->]

issue: rezacsedu: at a high level..I would suggest sticking to 2d for now if you don't know the difference between cnns,rnns etc then if you have to ask about it you probably don't need it 
solution: 

issue: Hi, is there in nd4j any other, more condensed/intuitive way to iterate over all rows to get the element at the specified column that the one proposed in here: [<-ISSUE->] ? 
solution: 

issue: I'm running into an issue when I use the Conv2D Op, which only shows up for particular parameter values, which leads me to believe that the issue is that I am choosing incorrect inputs. Here is the code I am testing: [<-LINK->] .  [<-LINK->] Here is the corresponding error output. 
solution: 

issue: That makes total sense. When I made those values much smaller everything runs much faster. Last question, can you explain what this error is?  [<-LINK->] kH and kW are 4 and 3, respectively Hmm ok. Do you have any recommendations for what I should try and do? If I change imgH and imgW from 256 to 258, everything runs. If the dimensions of the input image are 256, 512, 1024, etc, I get the error, but if I add 2 to the input value everything runs. There's a reshape and arange method in Nd4j, and to get specific elements just use getDouble or getInt.  [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: some new ops do that I'm on mobile atm, but there are new ops that allow such indexing select would be first guess 
solution: 

issue: Is there anyway to flatten a 2-D layer in dl4j ? ref: [<-ISSUE->] 5x2 thanks! I will try that 
solution: 

issue: a factor of 5x is is definitely more than I would have expected given the known issues, but yes, some performance issues are known in 1.0.0-alphasome are fixed already (and/or on PRs about to be merged), some are still being worked onnotably, there's an im2col performance regression in 1.0.0-alpha that we're aware of (one of the ops used in cnns and subsampling layers) that said, cudnn should help for that (I'd suggest using it if you aren't already) DrChainsaw: not yet, I'm doing benchmarks currently (0.9.1 vs. 1.0.0-alpha vs. one of my branches with fixes) so I'll be sure to check that alsothanks fgor the heads up 
solution: 

issue: I have been unsuccessful in getting ParallelInference to work with multiple GPUs. [<-LINK->] It seems to run with a single thread and multiple devices but the gpu activity always looks low When I try calling iter.next from different threads I have seen a variety of erros. from cuda ops being null. memory allocation problems had also run into this one somehow [<-LINK->] should I be not using multiple threads but maybe need to increase cache or grid/block sizes

issue: jef5ez: what version? 0.9.1 or 1.0.0-alpha? 
solution: 

issue: RobAltena: I have JDK 1.8, so I thought that this should work off the bat based on the docs. Regardless, I have set JAVAFX_HOME, and it still doesn't work. It's also worth noting that the April release of JDK 10 doesn't include a jfxrt jar. Is there any other approach I should try? 
solution: 

issue: pseudodennis: yes, it's not an NDArray, we basically need to use a Java array for that, like here: [<-LINK->] ankmathur96: for Java 10, we need to install this: [<-LINK->] but they don't seem to publish Maven artifacts yet. Maybe you could help by opening an issue about that there? But I thought they were only supposed to remove it from Java 11??

issue: What's the official way of getting a word from a matrix index in the ParagraphVectors model? I\'m getting IDs back in the form of "null123456789" from ParagraphVectors.vocab().wordAtIndex(wordVectorIndexInMatrix) The documentation says it's supposed to return null if the thing can't be found or it should return a word from the vocab This is neither, and I got what I'm doing from example code The only difference is that I saved and then loaded this model before trying to run this. In the example code, they do not save or load the model. I'm asking if it's an issue Or expected behavior And, more importantly, about any mitigation / workaround steps

solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: so, I can set my batch size to as low as 1. still does not work, if I have 8G gpu, what are good values for memory flags to start with? 
solution: 

issue: does dl4j can be used to run keras prediction using spark batch  ? does dl4j can be used to run keras prediction using spark batch ? 
solution: 

issue: Ok,  I am trying on bogus data, just for testing, using FileSplitDataSetIterator would show score dropping from 400 to 20 in one or two iterations. Using FileDataSetIterator with batch size =1 made the score around 400 after 20 something iterations, this could be that it's not learning from many examples at one iteration as before. So,  the issue is when I set batch size to 10, it throws memory error on a 24G GPU. Trying batch size = 1 on a 8G GPU gives:Caused by: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Physical memory usage is too high: physicalBytes = 10G > maxPhysicalBytes = 8G I set it. I have Tesla K10. I set physicalbytes and maxphysicalbytes to 8 gb, still does not work physicalbytes  >= maxphysicalbytes

[<-LINK->] j-henning: Welcome! Here's a link to Deeplearning4j's Gitter Guidelines, our documentation and other DeepLearning resources online. Please explore these and enjoy! [<-LINK->] 
solution: j-henning: by definition you can't use the training data to determine the early stopping point - if you did, you'd probably never stop training, as training data accuracy would continue increasing if you are overfitting. 

issue: indyMccarthy: those "?" characters are NaNswhiich suggests bad tuning, normalization, unstable network training etc topinju: maybe take a look at this? [<-LINK->] and if you haven't already, feel free to open an !issue for the 1d issues you are running into

issue: Why is in the example of the EarlyStoppingConfiguration the testData (and not the trainingData) uses for the scoreCalculator ( [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: In the last couple of days I started using DL4J and tried to implement a time series prediction with RNN. I found an example of an MultitimestepPrediction and used that as a starting point. Later I found out that the example was removed from the official examples because it was misleading ( [<-ISSUE->] and [<-ISSUE->] ). Now I am very confused and I wonder what was wrong, (in the discussion the rnnTimeStep is mentioned, but are there and other flaws)? 
solution: If you are looking for a better starting point: Have a look at the code in Deep Learning w Python, the temperature forecasting in chapter 6.. 

issue: Okay, that\'s interesting, but how would I  then now when to stop training // at what reconstruction "error" the model is? 
solution: haha I know, sorry, appreciate the quick explanation. Thanks for the advice.. 

issue: Hy everyone, this is my first time using ND4J. 
solution: 

issue: put another way: what exactly is "colors" - an int[][][] or something? ok, so there's no Nd4j.create(double[][][]) - which is why you can't find it what's the format/indexing? channels, height, width? again, if you try to use methods that don't exist, you'll get errors :) one option is to use something like: Nd4j.create(ArrayUtil.flattenDoubleArray(new double[3][4][5]), new int[]{3,4,5}, 'c'); 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I have a situation where a program using DL4J is working very well in CentOS (cuda 7.5) but the same program in Ubuntu (cuda 8.0) is running very slow specially to normalize csv data. Again same program in Windows (cuda 8.0) works very well. Is there any know such issue in Ubuntu? 
solution: 

issue: Hello! As I want to have a layer without bias, i tried biasInit(0) and biasLearningRate(0) but when i finished the training and reload the network i actually get a non zero b matrix ,  is this related to the updater ? so biasInit(0)  does not mean initiate the bias to be zero ? 
solution: it seems i dont even have this hasBias(false). but i have just checked that after the initial setting, the bias is indeed ZERO. 

issue: it was removed because it was very misleading, the thing is that setting iterations(x) would train on the same batch x times in a row before moving on to the next batch, and there are very few reasons if any to actually do something like that Depends on what you want you want to ultimately achieve 
solution: Ultimately I wish to perturb the weights of each layer in a MultiLayerNetwork by a layer-specific random number.. KolyaIvankov: there is an.assignmethod on the arrays you can use to overwrite the current contents, or use in-place operands. 

issue: and what stops you? you still can get params of each layer and that'll be INDArray so all regular rules apply jef5ez: i believe you've already got answer. thats known issue of 1.0.0-alpha, and it's being worked on right now. jef5ez:  [<-ISSUE->] <---- that's the PR you want to keep eye on.

issue: Added nd4j to my eclipse project and built shaded jar: an additional 1GB of stuff included. I had a look at the jars and it seems there are three architectures folded in at ~ 330MB a piece. Even one of those is a pretty ginormous jar - is it all necessary or is it possible to cut it down some? (the main reason I ask is that building my shaded jar just went from < 1s to "let me get a coffee and come back..." understood saudet: ok, cool. I guess if one is only going to be running on cuda then the AVX etc is not necessary, and vice cersa. currently generating a shaded jar in eclipse on my (admittedly rather slow) macbook takes several minutes because it has to churn through all the nd4j code *vice versa

solution: INDArray embeddings = Nd4j.zeros(batchSize, embTotalDim);. 

issue: Sirius081: features and embeddings - are they standalone arrays? or views? so they are both standalone? 
solution: no   featureMatrix is not shared. 

issue: Sirius081: i'm sorry, turns out my fresh Intellij installation is broken, so i can add tests right now. Please update your existing issue with code for your Nd4j.concat() use and shapes of arrays i'll pick it up @ morning

issue: Hi, I tried to add the artifactorg.nd4j:nd4j-native-platform:1.0.0-alphato my libraries on Azure Databricks but I always get this error, does anyone have a clue about how to fix this? [<-CODE->] AlexDBlack: All right, it accepts to add thend4j-native. On dl4j's side, is the artifactorg.deeplearning4j:dl4j-spark-ml_2.11:1.0.0-alpha_spark_2enough or should I also adddl4j-coreor evendl4j-spark-parameterserveras I saw in the examples? Oh all right, I really need to learn how dl4j works. Are there mandatory components for running on spark then? Oh all right, coming from libs such as TF I did not expect that, I'll try to dig deeper in the docs ;) 
solution: yeah. If you just want training and inference on spark - dl4j-spark_2.11 probably has most of what you need, plus an ND4J backend obviously(dl4j-spark it should transitively pull in deeplearning4j-core). 

issue: from the error message alone I'd guess that databricks is using ivy for its dependency management there, and Ivy is known to have problems with maven classifiers not sure if you can change the config there, but maybe [<-LINK->] helps 
solution: that's an impossible to answer question, without knowing what you are trying to doI mean you add the componentsyouneed for your task :)a lot of the components are totally optional.

solution: that was built as part of  master's thesis, not an engineering project with money attached to it. 

issue: So upgrading to the latest version (1.0.0-alpha) has fixed my issue above, but is now producing a runtime error: "Intel MKL FATAL ERROR: Cannot load libmkl_intel_thread.dylib.", have you seen this before? I'm downloading it now, 600Mb and my internet connection is almost slower than I had in the 90's connecting to bulletin boards via 14.4k.

issue: Hi. I'm having some trouble installing the Zeppelin bundled with the deeplearning4j tutorials via docker from this site: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: ChukwuemezieChristopherAneke: please post the error logs here Should be as easy as "docker run" and navigating to localhost:8080 
solution: 

issue: ChukwuemezieChristopherAneke: what problems specifically are you having? is it with Docker or the image itself? I have not seen that error before it just looks like a bunch of warnings have you tried opening port 8080? 
solution: can you file an issue? please include all known environment info such as operating system, the output ofdocker versionand anything else. 

issue: Hi Shams I am not sure what you mean when you say that the logs are thesame on your machine. Did you try installing the Zeppeline dl4j tutorial bundle from this link: [<-LINK->] and get thesame output that i provided in the gist? 
solution: 

issue: will Ctrl + C delete the download? The image file Zeppelin dl4j image file is 3.36 GB in size So I would like to remove it from my system aswell before re-downloading another instance. 
solution: It's alright to not know about this stuff but I would recommend you to see how docker works and what are images and containers etc. 

issue: ChukwuemezieChristopherAneke: glad I could help :) Could you please add comments to the filed issue here: [<-ISSUE->] and explain the solution so the issue can be resolved and closed 
solution: 

issue: I'm going to update the issue Justin suggested I create so that anyone else who comes across this problem doesn't end up on stackoverflow overcomplicating things. Yes Shams, Im on it!

solution: To use gist: paste your code/exception/large output log into [<-LINK->] , click 'Create Secret Gist' and paste URL link here. I did notice that NVIDIA's instructions differ from those on the page here [<-LINK->]. 

issue: also should I put things in the module pom or the pom for the project? 
solution: it should in theory work in either the parent pom or the sub-module pomstry it in the module you're actually running. if it matters, I installed cudnn to a non-standard directory (different drive). 

issue: thanks. Anyone familiar with what normal GPU usage %s are? Does it usually max out or hover at like 50%? 
solution: 

issue: any notice the example code at [<-LINK->] is not correct. ok,~ 
solution: 

issue: Sadly I am not math guy... insane equations are out of my scope.. But I can understand some relations.. Are there any guidelines? As I understand problem.. more neurons shouldn't decrease accuracy... It may be harder to train a bigger network, more epochs. But in the end more neurons = more resolution = higher accuracy but also higher chance of overfiting...

issue: saudet: Connect Four MDP question! For the ALEMDP example you referred me to - what does the Configuration class do, and do I need it for a simple array gameboard environment? Is that specific to the ALE, or does every MDP need one? saudet: Ok great, thanks again. (When I'm done with this I'm going to write a guide to contribute, btw) saudet: That's the plan... just so noobs like me can get up-and-running with a custom MDP :) saudet: Another question... I'm not seeing where the MDP stores the list of actual actions. I see the int[] that is set to the length of the action possibilities,  but I'm not seeing anything that initializes that array with the action-options themselves. 
solution: 

issue: pseudodennis: it's just options for ALE, so if your game doesn't have any, you don't need that pseudodennis:   a page on deeplearning4j.org would be great kemaldev: try with Java 8 or 9, Maven doesn't seem to work well with 10 yet You don't need an IntPointer, int[] is fine, List<Integer> is too, whatever you need! That's what programming is for 
solution: 

issue: @supergitaccHi, I changed the iterator in the hyperparameter optimization example. Now I get:probably: that means all candidates failed - i.e., none were successful, due to bad network config I don't think we touch mvnrepository.org directly - so if there is a reason, it's not our doing :) 
solution: "fit" by definition needs a dataset. a dataset itself is just a pair of inputs and labels, I'm not sure there's much to understand. 

issue: Need you guys again. thanks in advance for your time .  I invoked  "public MultiLayerNetwork fit(JavaRDD<DataSet> trainingData)"  of SparkDl4jMultiLayer. Then are there some methods for output probabilities of labels in rdd format? If not,  should I collect rdd of dataset,  and invoke "INDArray output(INDArray input, boolean train, INDArray featuresMask, INDArray labelsMask)" one by one?

solution: 

issue: o.d.d.i.AsyncDataSetIterator - Premature end of loop!looks like your data iterator is somehow bad/failing?@AlexDBlack - I think the issue is occuring because I don't get a score:Best score: nullIndex of model with best score: -1Any idea about why this could happen? Yes, probably that is best option. I cant find the bug.no its an older version, I will update to the latetest. I use 0.9.1 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: I think there is somewhere an issue in my stuff but I cant figure it out what is going wrong. I use the same LSTM model which I previously used in a normal training. So I should get a successful model. I also removed all prameterspace options - so i should have the same model which normally works. Is there an opportunity to get more information - for example what is the loss in each batch? I think such information could help to figure out what is going wrong... maybe I found it, preprocessor seems not work / normalize the data .... 
solution: 

issue: supergitacc: open an !issue with something I can run to reproduce your problemreally hard to know what's going on without being able to run this in the debugger but normally you should simply get an exception and you are on 1.0.0-alpha, right? 
solution: 

issue: export gensim model to csv and load this csv it using WordVectorSerializer methods Caused by: org.nd4j.linalg.factory.Nd4jBackend$NoAvailableBackendException: start from the very beginning then. what's your os? post !gist with your current pom.xml as well show menvcc --versionoutput <version>0.9.1</version> and remove this dependency i've told you in issue you shouldn't mix versions you have 2 dependencies of wrong version ??? lolwhat? that explains your problem if you dont have nvcc - you dont have CUDA Toolkit then and you need one :) 
solution: 

issue: AllenWGX: is this on Linux or Windows? I see Linux, let me double check here, one thing though, remove  ~/.javacpp/cache to make sure that's not causing problems CUDA 8.0 works fine for me on Fedora 27 with 1.0.0-alpha and dl4j-examples... AllenWGX: Could you try dl4j-examples on the command line? Hum, actually it looks like your project is picking up ND4J 0.8.0 on your class path: This won't work Not ND4J, actually, probably the wrong libcudart.so gets loaded. Do you have multiple copies on your system? AllenWGX: right so there's probably another version of libcudart.so on your system that is interferring

solution: or, maybe, even exception?. 

issue: is this for real or a lie "The current snapshot version is 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT" 
solution: 

issue: no, having it normalize labels by default would be a bad idea (as it'd break labels for nets doing classification)there's a method to enable it on the normalizer... normalizeLabels(boolean) or something (can't recall the exact name) 
solution: rpatra: you can strip down nd4j-native-platform a bit but beyond that probably have to modularize nlp a bit based on the new decoupling we did. polisettyManoj: complex number support in ND4J isn't functional at present, sorrythere's just not enough demand relative to other (higher priority) features for us to get to it yetthough eventually, yes - it's something we will support in the future.

solution: you're telling someone who was doing support on google lists 5 years ago in 2013 to change back to something he spent 2 years trying to get work. 

issue: How is the work organized in the project ? I'm curious about contributing a few hours a week maybe. 
solution: 

issue: You are using some AST based code analysis => code generation ? I'll dig into using dl4j first, maybe small changes to documentation would be easiest place to start. 
solution: 

issue: Are there any examples that use images for regression and/or involve appending additional input columns (a few numbers) to image training data? Thanks for the reply@RobAltena. I just try to avoid duplicating work! I'm hoping there is some sort of pipeline approach that avoids loading the entire image dataset into memory while augmenting the inputs with the additional numbers but I'm not sure if that exists. 
solution: 

issue: Chrono7: yes that's image record reader - most of the tricks are in here: [<-LINK->] ssatturi: is there any reason why you didn't just use local? For inference why does it have to be the spark one? I find it odd that you wouldn't just use local after that

solution: if it can't use cudnn it usually logs an error message, thats pretty much the only way that you would know that cudnn isn't being used, so what does it tell you?. 

issue: loss layers can be embedded in other parts of the graph they were introduced after output layers 
solution: 

issue: MaxLeiter: yes, but how do you need to process the images exactly? MaxLeiter: ok, should work pretty much as is, what is the issue? 
solution: 

issue: after a lot of training of a transfer-learned graph then saving it, I get this when trying to load a serialized version: "Error deserializing JSON ComputationGraphConfiguration" for some reason it's putting the conv2d layer after the loss layer (and global pooling layer) do you want a copy of the JSON? or the whole model? maybe it's because I'm using a custom loss function? 
solution: 

issue: Hi, a quick question, how could I force the program to use a specific CUDA version?  I have recently upgrade the Deeplearning4j from 0.9.1 to 1.0-apha and also switch to nd4j-cuda-9.1-platform.  I have both CUDA 8.0 and 9.1 installed on my machine, and for some reasons my program doesn't pickup the 9.1 version and start using CPU instead of GPU.   If I switch the pom.xml back to nd4j-cuda-8.0-platform then everything works fine.  BTW, i have set up the CUDA_HOME and _LIBRARY path already to point to the 9.1 version, but it doesn't seem to work. BTW, the nvcc --version returns the right version (9.1). 
solution: raver119: in my pom, i use nd4j-cuda-9.1-platform, but it doesn't seem to work.. the program switch to CPU somehow.. 

issue: Any example where multiple features (4) are used to predict a single value.. (multi regression). Trying to build a model to predict composition of a hydrocarbon stream with intensive variables like temperature and pressure measure on a distillation column. I successfully built a partial least squared regression model on some distillation columns and would like to use deeplearning4j for the non linear components The MultiTimestepRegressionExample is the best starting point I think.@AlexDBlackhow can I map the problem I described above to the sample code you have on got *git 
solution: 

issue: does transfer learning helper use FineTuningConfiguration anywhere, because I can't see it? or I guess you might pass in a ComputationGraph made with TransferLearning.GraphBuilder ?

solution: 

issue: Are there current known issues of "mvn clean install" concerning the dl4j-examples? I\'m getting a build failure on Ubuntu Linux. I have posted a GithubGist: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Chrono7:  [<-LINK->] ploger: stick to java 8 alexklibisz: mind clarifying? I wonder if you actually applied it right. You shouldn't have any classifiers or anything on platform 
solution: 

issue: oh! Does data imbalance also apply to regression?  My data contains many examples with small output value but occasionally the output is maybe x10 larger 
solution: Alcalol: yeah, if the distribution is really skewed you might want to look at something like a box-cox transform or something. 

issue: Hello guys ! Sorry to disturb, i've just finished learning RL theories ( Qlearning and DeepQ learning) and i want to do some practice on my own in java.   Could you give me the name of a good IDE for RL developping ? I currently use Atom but i'm not fully satisfied.. 
solution: 

issue: I'm using fitFeaturized and I'm getting a shape mismatch error... currently I'm putting:transferLearningHelper.fitFeaturized(new DataSet(featurized,Nd4j.create(labels)));I guess I might have to transpose the labels? the error is when computing the gradient, so I assume it's the labels I think that's what it was

issue: Hi all! I'm trying the 1.0.0-alpha1 version of DL4J and I'm having memory issues, namely: org.nd4j.linalg.exception.ND4JIllegalStateException: Failed to allocate [4166301068] bytes 
solution: 

issue: On that note, since ndarrays are not stored in the jvm, they are not bound to -Xmx settings, correct? 
solution: 

issue: And without any Xmx setting, does an error such asBad number of bytes requested for allocation: -1942727296indicate too little memory in my machine? I’m seeing it, if I increase the size of an input data set, but the error message seems a bit counter-intutive. Is it the expected behavior in case of too much input data, or rather a potential bug in nd4j? It occurs deep in the nd4j-cpu code: [<-CODE->] 
solution: you might want to try the current snapshots though, as it may be already fixed since im2col/col2im has seen some changes recently. 

issue: holgerbrandl: that’s definitely a bug. can you, by any chance, show me the code that reproduces this behavior? xiptos: it fails after 3rd iteration because that’s the moment when workspaces do their allocation. i’d try to get rid of xms value and use xmx=1g i'd say - time to file an !issue cc@maxpumperla^^^

issue: Hi, a quick question here.  What is the purpose of resetting the DataSetIterator in every epoch?  I the RegressionSum example, it has iterator.reset(); inside the nEpochs loop, while in the MLP MinistSingleLayerExample example it doesn't.   So I'm not quite sure about it.  Anyone can help me with that? 
solution: Basically, the iterator is, well, an iterator in that it loads new entries by means of next(), and stops when hasNext() == false. So, in order to start over you need to reset the iterator. This seems to be the case in the regression example.. 

issue: KolyaIvankov: here is the code snippet I am using:while (testIter.hasNext()){\n            DataSet test = testIter.next();\n            INDArray features = test.getFeatures();\n            INDArray labels = test.getLabels();\n            double[][] newLabels = labels.toDoubleMatrix();\n            System.out.println(newLabels);\n            INDArray[] output = net.output(features);\n            list.add(output[0]);\n            eval.eval(labels, output[0]);\n        }using this while evaluating a network net. Am I doing anything wrong?

Ritaplfigueiredo: your problem is justSystem.out.println(newLabels)at this point double arrays have a pretty useless.toStringmethod so that is way you are seeing D@... stuff yes, but is there even a good reason for you to get the data that way? you are trying to run a gpu example, and it can't load cuda make sure you have cuda 9.1 (and only that) intalled

solution: 

issue: int labelIdx = labels.indexOf(io.getLabel()); outLabel.putScalar(exampleNum, 4 + labelIdx, imgGridY, imgGridX, 1.0);labels are set here, why they are wrong? 
solution: @SidneyLann assuming labels are one-hot (for classification) you can use Nd4j.argMax(indLabel, 1)that's exactly what I said. You're labels are not one-hot, and you're not doing classification, so surprise: it doesn't work. I use yolo2,  reference to ObjectDetectionRecordReader, it should be one-hot and classification. 

issue: I suppose you are right.  minibatch is used to train multiple images together.  the parameters are also updated together for each batch. correct me if I am wrong.@SidneyLann 
solution: ought to, not sure. 

issue: when genrate dataset and train? I seen they are together when generate in source not sure when training 
solution: yes, when training also... that's determined by ObjectDetectionRecordReader. 

issue: I think that it is possible to have the best score in the middle of dataset. But do you think it is good to stop training there? Or is it better to always finish training on whole dataset? agibsonccc: I am using it aleady. But I have found this line in logHit termination condition on iteration 30175: score=0.0024387193485027347, oldScore=0.002438711076315899,condition=org.deeplearning4j.optimize.terminations.EpsTermination@47f68063But my best score at the end of epoch 8 is 0.4425324527124717

solution: 

issue: but actually that's a good example of why@MilanVancais focusing on the wrong thing it's a kind of strawman problem you've got in your mind that it's a problem but what I'd say is you've got to go away and think about why that problem (the 'same' images in train and test) isn't actually a problem, because I can tell you 100% that it isn't feelings.. powerful motivators ;)

issue: I am trying to get a basic implementation of Federated Learning (FL) for a neural network together using dl4j. As I understand FL, the idea is that we:Train multiple models  on small distinct training sets (known as local models)\nCompute a single global model by averaging the weights of all the local models\nReplace the local models for the global model and then repeat from step 1. for some amount of iterations.The idea being that  we this way get a model that reflects the union of the training data without having to collect the all the training sets centrally (a privacy feature).I was wondering if someone have some pointers on how to achieve this with dl4j? Mainly, I am not sure what would be a good (preferably simple) way to do the averaging step?

issue: hey guys, I have a model, an autoencoder in keras that works with tensorflow, but when I try to import the configuration in depl4j it gives me an error, that says:Could not determine number of outputs for layer: no output_dim or nb_filter field found. The json for te model is following: [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: I am trying to useLossLayer, but I am getting a weird NullPointerException. There is not example of this layer in examples repository. Is it supposed to be working? Or should it be used in a very specific way? I updated the gist treo: I tried it both ways, same result. I updated the stack trace in gist 
solution: 

issue: When doing [<-CODE->] the callback is just called once. Shouldn’t it be called once for each epoch? 
solution: 

issue: dlasyd: very likely what you’re seeing is this: [<-ISSUE->] sorry, I meant@degivan 
solution: 

issue: Relating to my previous comment, model.epochCount isjust1 after processing aMultipleEpochsIterator, so I guess it’s a bug. Not sure if there’s an easy fix, becauseMultiLayerNetwork#fit(DataSetIterator)is not aware of the epochy nature of its argument. Thanks for the clarification@treo.  I could indeed use an epoch-loop,  but this would renderMultipleEpochsIteratorobsolete. Since it might confuse others as well, I summed it up in [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: Hello everybody. Just a quick note of thanks for writing the “Practitioners Book”. I just finished it and helped me a lot to understand your framework. Also, did a quick mention of DL4J in my latest post: [<-LINK->] Cheers 
solution: 

issue: in 1.0.0-something there were added methods like toDoubleMatrix etc right to INDArray methods but as adam alread said - do not use that unless you're 100% sure you need that because that's not free process 
solution: 

issue: Hey, what type of RecordReader would you suggest to read in the training format of [<-LINK->] that is csv with the label in the first column and gray-scale image data flattened in the 784 other columns? So one 28x28 image with a label per line. I thought about CSVRecordReader but it does not seem to support labels. 
solution: 

issue: Hi, I downloaded 1.0.0 dl4j examples, but I'm not able to run examples... Actually, I can run examples via command line, but not through intellij ide. It's throwing error - Error:Android Pre Dex: [dl4j-examples] Android SDK is not specified 
solution: holgerbrandl: csvrecordreader definitely supports labels. 

issue: Which method prints a model's architecture (layername + params IN + params OUT)? I saw the output somewhere but I can't seem to find the associated method Cheer. Is it possible tonotload a certain backend (specifically GPU) even tho the backend jars are in the classpath? I looked at: [<-LINK->] and it seems that it force-loads all backends that are found in the classpath [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Hi all, can anyone answer this question [<-LINK->] Sorry, my mistake. 
solution: 

issue: was running the example: [<-LINK->] I got "host not found" error in the beginning. Added an entry in the host file and it shows "connection timed out". Here is the host entry:52.229.32.188 deeplearning4j-resources.westus2.cloudapp.azure.comHost is loading fine while hitting from nrowser **browser 
solution: 

issue: Is sum() without arguments undefined? I think I get different results with CPU and GPU backend INDArray.sum() that is 
solution: 

issue: polaroidkidd: it does that with 1.0.0-alpha polaroidkidd: ah, yes, you'll need 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT 
solution: 

issue: We tested with GPU-backend in two versions of dl4j0.9.1 and dl4j1.0.0-alpha with p3.2xlarge of aws.The errors were different, but both versions did not work properly.dl4j0.9.1 has been tested with cuda 8,dl4j1.0.0-alpha has been upgraded to cuda 9.1.Does it support the aws environment?

issue: Hi, I'm wondering about label masking - Just to check my understanding, for one training example, only the label indices where the mask = 1 will be trained? 
solution: EddyJens: it's just one more layer.. 

issue: I am new to Gitter and have been working with dl4j for several months. I am now trying to use datavec to streamline getting training data into my models.  I had everything working and then expanded the input csv to 52 columns.  Everything looks fine, the schema the data, etc.  I then created a transform process that simply drops all but 17 of the attributes I wanted to try and train on.  When the transform process is applied I get the following error: "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot execute transform: input writables list length (1) does not match expected number of elements (schema: 52). Transform = RemoveColumnsTransform([predicted_age_bracket]) and record ".  The exception  is generated at line 127 of RemoveColumnsTransform,java.  I would appreciate any ideas how to fix/troubleshoot ths. dlwaticg: gist link is here [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: dlwaticg: post a !gist of your code and stack trace please fredo994: users should not be using the implementations directly amcelroy: file an !issue on the examples please 
solution: 

issue: Intellij takes a LONG time doing "Copying resources" when I run programs in dl4j-examples. Why, when I run VariationalAutoEncoderExample, does the digit reconstruction visualization show only a few of the 10 digits?@AlexDBlack 
solution: I thought it is supposed to show each of the 10 digits.. DonaldAlan: file an issue on the docs or send us a PR if you want it to do something else - we mainly just picked random samples at the time. 

issue: @dlwaticgWhen the transform process is applied I get the following error: "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot execute transform: input writables list length (1) does not match expected number of elements (schema: 52).usually that means you\'re using the wrong delimiter: i.e., comma delimiter but your data is space delimited, or somethingalso make sure you\'re on 1.0.0-alpha sure, npone other possible cause is a malformed line - i.e., a single (or more) bad line in the data, with most of it being OKthe other thing to try (if you are running locally) is putting a breakpoint on that exception and inspect the data that's causing it no, not really got a link to the paper/architecture? I have seen that paper before... if memory serves me, that would just be a computation graph with 4 inputs though hm... that keras implementation looks like they are stacking grayscale images channel-wise perhaps? yeah, I'm not 100% sure on that, but it certainly looks a lot like a (per output?) label mask 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: Thank you for the response.  I am using 1.0.0-alpha and pretty sure my file is comma delimited.  I will subset the file and try it again and post the file if i get the same error.  This was working before when i tested with 10 or so columns, when I added the 52 columns this error popped up.  Note all the data munging is done using the same code and technique.  Will test and post file tomorrow morning.  Thanks again for the suggesting and idea on something to check. 
solution: 

issue: if a paper talks about stacking 4 images as input to a cnn but I want one output, does it make sense to use global pooling along dimension 0?  [<-LINK->] someone else wrote for Keras: [<-LINK->] also they talk about two inputs where the secondary input is a mask they multiply with the main output... can I just do this by training with a label mask? the actions_input and merge at the end 
solution: 

issue: i find the 1.0.0-alpha does not have org.deeplearning4j.nn.layers.convolution.CudnnConvolutionHelper; so i can not use cudnn ,is right? 
solution: It'd  be really arbitrary of us to not support cudnn. 

issue: hi, I upgraded from CUDA8 to CUDA9 but cannot find CUDA9 maven dependencies .. i'm working with 0.9.1 
solution: it works with both cuda9 and cuda9.1 right? I need cuda9 to migrate a model from TF.

solution: 

issue: Hi. For some reason when I'm trying to implement the FACENETNN4SMALL2 Transfer Learning network, it only outputs 1 class while it does have 40 output classes. All my 40 faces are being classified as the same face... :/ I created a gist with the full code here: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: I'm currently upgrading and meanwhile I looked through the source code. Is it correct that FaceNetNN4Small2 isn't pretrained but VGG16Face is? 
solution: yeah, no pretrained model for the first: [<-LINK->]. and yes, there is a VGG16 pretrained variant called VGGFace (I'm not familiar with the details though, see the link in the javadoc I guess) [<-LINK->]. 

issue: AlexDBlack: Rebuilt the stack, ignored nd4j-shade containing a jackson module that was imported in several files. experiencing the same problem :( AlexDBlack: Well, here I have IntellIJ 2017. And in 18 on my home computer I can't even bring dl4j-examples to run :( 
solution: 

issue: Since in1.0.0-alphatheModelSelectorhas been removed, I should instantiate the FaceNetNN4Small2 model myself right? SoZooModel m = new FaceNetNN4Small2()but how can I set thenOutof this model? When I callm.init()thenOutmust be above 0, this value seems hardcoded, how can I change this? 
solution: it was getting a bit unweildy with something on the order of 8+ args for the constructors, so we moved to a builder pattern. 

issue: other random thought: maybe there's a (semi-silent) compilation issue due to lacking lombok - so it's failing earlier, never getting through the build to re-check/correct that shaded jackson annotation error? do you have lombok plugin installed? 
solution: 

issue: Yes sure, I'll first try re-downloading the vggface pretrained model, maybe I have an older version cached 
solution: 

issue: Hi, is there a way to modify a RecordReaderDataSetIterator so that it reads in multiple inputs, as well as multiple outputs? I need to use a computation graph with several input and several output layers, but I can't figure out how to feed in the (csv) data 
solution: threepwoody: you would use a RecordReaderMultiDataSetIterator for that. 

issue: Hi, I am training a very simple cnn similar to Lenet for a 3-label classifier. I have run the same codes several times.  Sometimes it got some result, gave Accuracy about 0.9; sometimes it just  classified all examples into label-3. Any hint about this issue? 
solution: 

issue: hi, I just upgraded from0.9.1 to 1.0.0-alpha. my Alexnet (that was userd to run 200 samples/sec) now works only 75 samples/sec .. any known performnce issues?

issue: inspect opencv methods? if theres' something - it's there, not in nd4j/datavec 
solution: 

issue: I am looking at [<-ISSUE->] The CPU and CUDA examples have diverged quite a bit. Is it worth doing the maintenance and bring them back in line? Or should we simply remove the Cuda specific example?There might be a genuine issue with paralelwrapper hidden in there somewhere, but I am not sure this example is the right approach to flushing it out.

solution: yup.. 

issue: yes, I'm using eclipse AlexDBlack: yes, I'm using Eclipse IDE 
solution: yeah, that's probably your problemEclipse's maven support is notoriously badbasically: if you change the pom.xml version, it doesn't necessarily mean your eclipse project will be updated properly. (which defeats the whole point of using a build tool, but I digress...). anyway, run a "mvn eclipse:eclipse" and try again. 

issue: has anyone successfully deployed the new 1.0.0 version on android and could show me their build.gradle file? I\'m getting "Program Type Already Present" errors...It worked fine with 0.9.1, but I can\'t keep using it because of a bug. Trying to set up dl4j 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT on android. after every build, a new duplicate .dll file is found that I exclude manually, then it finds the next. I'm at almost 20 now and I'm not sure if I'd like to proceed this way. any hints (or a complete build.gradle-file) available? :) AlexDBlack: I'm not even handling nd4j until now - the only line is:implementation group: 'org.deeplearning4j', name: 'deeplearning4j-core', version: '1.0.0-SNAPSHOT'. Should I change something? 
solution: 

issue: When I read in a number of values from a csv file representing layers of a 2D input for a convolutional network, do I need to use setInputTypes(InputType.convolutionalFlat(depth,width,height)), as said on [<-LINK->] Or is it (height,width,depth) as written in the class InputType? I'm trying to figure out how the flattened input is reshaped AlexDBlack: OK, but I can't find out how it is actually reshaped. So should my flat input go through the first row, then second row etc of the first layer, and after the last row go to the first row of the second layer? Or is that the wrong flattening? 
solution: 

issue: Does ConvolutionMode.Same automatically add zero-padding to the input such that input layers and output layers have equal size? Do I understand correctly that I should not zero-pad manually?

issue: Is there a way I can do labelencoding & onehotencoding before preparing my data set?  I couldnt find relevant docs I browsed through the examples, but couldnt find any wanted to encode string data to binary for classification used datasetiterator, but since not encoded, iteration fails throwing numberformatexception just the label encoding & onehot encoding together.I used RecordReaderDataSetIterator, but it throws numberformat exception. The latter one I'm checking right now @AlexDBlackhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/rahul-raj/Problem-Solving/master/DeepLearning4j.javaThis is failing for me with numberformat exception.Guess labelSample dataset used:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rahul-raj/Problem-Solving/master/Churn_Modelling.csv **Guess labelencoding  doesnt get applied automatically and onehot encoding isnt being applied.

issue: rpatra: Short unrelated question: are you using 0.9.1? 
solution: 

issue: rahul-raj: while has next like you would the other ones? Keep in mind that it's relative to the underlying record reader the transform process one is just a wrapper 
solution: 

issue: rpatra: sorry, that's known issue, and can't be fixed at this moment. randomness, that is. there's too much concurrency involved, and impossible to guarantee order of execution for operations :( 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: Thanks! That is exactly what I was looking for, though@raver119pointed out there is much to learn about model score vs. NN error 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] but it fails when doing multiple epochs. What would be the correct way of reshaping the data prior to processing? 
solution: 

issue: just tried it with your file, and the w2v example, and it doesn't have a single word that contains a space character G4mble: I've even used your string preprocessor 
solution: treo: i suspect that's encoding issue. i.e. windows os is used, with non-UTF encoding set as default.. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44346756/transformprocess-transform-data-while-using-datasetiterator [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: @G4mble @raver119 let's give this issue a bit more structure.@G4mble Can you please create a minimal example that contains everything, i.e. a data file, and your exact source code? Maybe as a github repository? I'd like to be able to clone it and run it, just to see if this is something that is just a problem on your machine, or if there is more to it. I'm on a german windows 10 as well, so it should be a somewhat comparable environment 
solution: If you are running your program from intellij, you can click on the first line in the output to expand the command that it used to start your program, it usually contains an encoding parameter there as well. 

issue: treo: @raver119I'm currently trying several ways of setting the UTF encoding on the app, see if anything changes.I'll get back to you if I'm certain that the problem is not caused by the encoding issue.Thank you so far. 
solution: 

issue: threepwoody: elaborate please. not sure i'm following your question samuelchapas: same. what do you mean? 
solution: 

issue: Hi all! I am new to Deeplearning4j and I am struggling a bit with the APIs and maybe the data format. I managed to successfully run the Mnist example. I trained and persisted a two layer MLP using the Scalanet API. Now I loaded the model again from the file system and I tried to predict the label of a new image. [<-CODE->] This throws an error: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] I saw different examples on how images are loaded but every example uses completely different APIs, predefined example classes, etc. I can't really make sense from them. Thanks @raver119. I understand. How do I convert it to the same shape? Isn't it supposed to rescale as I am using the same height or width? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: Found those. So I'm gonna rewrite my training part using custom image pipelines that I can reuse for prediction preprocessing then. I thought there would be a way to get my PNG into the same shape as the data was I used for training. 
solution: crops, scales, etc. 

issue: @rahul-raj I already replied to you:@rahul-rajyou may be running into this: deeplearning4j/DataVec#561already fixed on master - you can use !snapshots, or the new release with the fix should be out soon yeah, there was unfortunately a bug in 1.0.0-alpha for TranformProcessRecordReader we're preparing a new release that should be out soon (once all testing is complete and passes)!snapshots information is avaliable an the following link: 
solution: 

issue: @AlexDBlacknormally a .setInputType(InputType.convolutionalFlat(...)) is all you need for that...Great hint, I’ll try that.Not sure why that would fail with multiple epochs though (should be fine) - mind filing an !issue? [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: How to save model checkpoints in 0.9.1? 
solution: 

issue: @raver119no, there's no such waymay i wonder, what's your use case for that option? Tanks for respone, its take too long time to load model in my computer Google vector model have 3M unique word i want import first 500000 word (most frequent words) 
solution: bunyamink: you can build your own word embeddings then?. 

issue: Hi, how does DL4J handle the shuffling of a dataset between epochs? Is this something a DataSetIterator can do? Thanks Rahul, but doesn't DataSet just represent individual batches of the dataset?  How do you shuffle the whole dataset between epochs? The order within a batch won't matter that much

issue: strolling-coder: a jvm crash shouldn't ever happen. can you please file an !issue with a minimal example that  reproduces the crash? strolling-coder: you usually shouldn't be moving stuff from off-heap memory back on the heap like that anyway. But whatever you were doing there, should either throw a proper error message, or simply not compile. So the bug report is in any case needed

issue: Hello! I want to predict calendar events based on previous events. What could be the best aproach? Is there any example that does something similar? Yeah events that have start and end date. Also some type attribute So if I have calendar that have had MEETING every friday 8:00 to 9:00 for past 6 months then it should predict that it's going to happen also next friday Could it be something like time series predicting for the starting time of the specific type events. Then another predictor for other attributes like lenght? 
solution: 

issue: probably better to just add a try/catch when loading, and look at an older model if the latest failsmind opening an !issue? that shouldn't be hard to add thanks. note all these problems in the issue, give me some code to reproduce it and I'll make sure it gets fixed 
solution: 

issue: Is nOut automatically calculated when using ConvolutionMode.Same? But nIn still needs to be specified? They both refer to the depth in the case of convnets, correct? 
solution: threepwoody: so you always need to specify nOut - that's basically the layer sizenIn doesn't have to be specified if you use setInputType (it'll be inferred from network structure)but has to at some point be set to the number of input channels. 

issue: AlexDBlack: regarding my 'IllegalStateException: Invalid mask array' in the context of 'Convolution1DLayer', I created an according gist that shows the issue: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: It actually could be a batch balance problem. Each mini batch should ideally be a representative sample of the whole data set. If, for some reason, your batches have widely different characteristics, then seeing such fluctuations is to be expected 
solution: 

issue: can anyone here expand on this line in the memory doc? "It’s not recommended to use HOST-only arrays directly, since they will dramatically reduce performance. But they might be useful as in-memory cache pairs with the INDArray.unsafeDuplication() method." I'm interested in this in-memory cache pairs part raver119: For starters, what does unsafeDuplication do, and if you use HOST-only, does it just copy INDArrays to the GPU when computing something? 
solution: so if I have a bunch of INDArrays that won't fit in my GPU but will fit in my CPU RAM, how should I store them off-GPU until they are needed on GPU for training?. 

issue: Hello WOW, Yolo2 :) you++ I am trying to use the VGG16 CIFAR pre trained network - would you recommend that? looks like it is too old, I don't know if you tested it with 1.0-beta

issue: Hi, Im triying to import a Keras Model (functional API), but I'm getting the following error: InvalidKerasConfigurationException: Parameter gamma does not exist in weights.  Any ideas? 
solution: no, you should use that maxbytes value to match your cpu ram. 

issue: raver119: . is the DL4J code being updated to fit with the changes? I'm trying to build it from source and I'm getting all sorts of errors in methods that expected INDArray.shape() to be an int[]

solution: 

issue: I'm a little bit mystified. I created a BaseDatasetIterator instance, then I wrapped it in an AsyncDataSetIterator and I used it in the call to fit() of a ParallelWrapper. It failed with the same error described by issue [<-ISSUE->] , so I removed the AsyncDataSetIterator and it worked.Later by chance I had a look at the code of the ParallelWrapper and I saw that it does the same, if the iterator is not yet wrapped it wraps it in an AsyncDataSetIterator. For the moment I didn't double check in the debugger (there's a batch running), but that really seems the case, so I'm wondering why the AsyncDataSetIterator is working when it is instantiated by the ParallelWrapper. I had images already preprocessed. Chunked into set of patches and scaled If the ParallelWrapper is using the Async that's fine with me, it's actually what I wanted. I was just curious to understand what was happening. 
solution: 

issue: holger-prause: first, that's definitely using GPUsecond, are you using 1.0.0-beta? (if not, make sure you upgrade)note that GPUs won't always be faster if they don't have much data - like, for a single imagethat said, that time does seem excessive, even for a 1050 (though your low memory might explain it) 
solution: 

issue: darknet yolo native compile on 0.03 msthat said, I can also guarantee that value is wrongno sizable CNN can do inference in 0.03ms 
solution: than the output is wrong - i will check the source code from then darknet project. anyway, a github issue would be good herecould be something as simple as an incorrectly run benchmark, something to do with your memory config, or something else. 

issue: to be really fair - should i recompile the darknet code with cuda 9.0 instead of 9.2 and measure then?

issue: Is there a way in Nd4j to iterate over all index combinations of an n-dimensional array? Say we haveG in R^(d_1 x ... x d_n)as an INDArray, I want to iterate over each index In a two dimensional example ofG in R^(2 x 3)this would be:(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) saudet: Yes I need the indices,@AlexDBlackthanks, this looks like what I need

issue: I have a problem using the NumberedFileInputSplit with a relative path. When specifying the path absolute, everything works fine (trainingFeatureReader.initialize(new NumberedFileInputSplit("C:\\Users\\henning\\Documents\\java_projects\\timeseriesprediction\\data\\training\\features\\%d.csv", 0,size)I want to use a realative path and tried: trainingFeatureReader.initialize(new NumberedFileInputSplit("data/training/features/%d.csv", 0,size));which results in an error. What I am doing wrong? I don't no what should be wrong. My project folder looks like this:timeseriesprediction->scr->data -->training   --->features   --->labelsSo I think data/training/features/%d.csv should work fine 
solution: 

issue: it should work fine with relative pathsanyway, open an !issue and I'll double check at some point when I have timebut yeah, for now just provide absolute path

issue: LSTM layers require quite a bit of memory, don't they? Yeah I meant that they seem to need particularily much But anyways, would you mind if I asked you a little bit about my configuration? Like if it makes sense the way I do it, or if there are glaring mistakes 
solution: I was making it large so the network would be able to properly assess complex language. 

issue: raver119: sory if you replyed to my question and i did not see it, but can you help me to find order or layer sizes for VAE?Is it correct configuration to get shape 76-60-40-20-10-20-40-60-76?

issue: Following [<-LINK->] , the UI isn\'t rendering the network in "Model" tab nor are any graphs working "Score" oscillates from infinity to -infinity, "Iterations" switches between 0 and 1 (or nothing) using MultipleEpochsIterator Currently using the AlexNet from the ModelZoo  [<-LINK->] the output 
solution: 

issue: frakc: re: VAE - the order of those params is specified in the order you might reasonably expectit follows the connection structure starting from the inputi.e., input -> encoder1, encoder2, ..., nOut, decoder1, decoder2, ... DrChainsaw: you can use 1.0.0-beta release for now... not too much has changed on master since that MaxLeiter: I'd need to see the code you are using to configure and train the networkalso, in general I'd recommend upgrading to 1.0.0-beta 
solution: 

issue: Alex, do you have a moment to look over my network configuration and maybe give me some tips on how to improve it? Where would I find that? I don't use gitter that often Also it\'s less of a tuning issue and more of a "did I do it right?" thing, because while I know how NNs etc. work, I\'m not familiar with the vocab and terminology whatsoever and I find the sheer amount of choices a bit overwhelming 
solution: @MaxLeiterit should live-update as the net is running, correct?yeah, it shouldonly exception is NaNs in parameters etc - they obviously can't be rendered on a chart :). 

issue: I want to create aGradientUpdater. What isIUpdater.instantiate'sviewArrayparameter meant to be? I can't really wrap my head around the implementation/docs yes, thanks AlexDBlack: on top of the above question, it seems it's not really possible to use aGradientUpdaternot in the context of dl4j, is it?IUpdater.instantiatealways requires a viewArray depending on the actualIUpdaterimplementation, so I can't just pass a viewArray, based on my gradients array-size but on theIUpdaterspecific implementation based its parameters I was specifically looking atUpdaterBlock( [<-LINK->] ) and how it calls theIUpdater.instantiatebut the logic there is way to entangled in the layer-logic where it is used 
solution: 

issue: treo: Issue is posted: [<-ISSUE->] sure@treo 
solution: 

issue: KolyaIvankov: as long as you can make sure that the math is right and you can create tests that show the updater is working as intended, I guess that you could still create a pull request even if you can't exactly reproduce the results from that paper. You might want to try out and see how some of the examples work with it though :) that looks like a corrupted dll. I'd suggest you remove your .m2 directory and redownload the dependencies

issue: My DL4J seems to accumulate a lot of huge temp files (datsets used in previous runs) and not clean them up by itself, is that normal? 
solution: 

issue: can you get an output of the dependency tree (see my link earlier?) so we can see whether it actually includes everything thats needed? 
solution: 

issue: FRosner: great, now can you create the same tree with the platform dependency? It looks a lot like sbt hasn't picked up the classifier dependency and I'd like to see if this tree printing plugin for sbt actually outputs that info meh :( So sbt is still subpar when it comes to that One of the reasons why the platform module was introduced was because sbt doesn't work quite correctly with maven classifiers

issue: agibsonccc: I never manually touch my maven local folder I just did it this time in a very deicate way don't worry about maven it is working I am now asking baout an error that I am getting in ALPHA also beta now 
solution: 

issue: trea: regarding your short intro: I normally like to re-shuffle each epoch (with large data at least large buffers of it) before turning them into batches. I do this with a custom RecordReader in dl4j - did I re-invent the wheel there? I did not find anything out-of-the-box in dl4j, but maybe i did not look properly... 
solution: agibsonccc: I am on holiday starting next week, but once I am back I'll clean it up, document it and put it on github. But I think it is not ideal, as the default RecordReaders already do async prefetching - doing it in an additional RecordReader for shuffling drives up memory cost. It did not hurt in my case, as the whole data was just a few hundred MB and I could easily fit it into RAM multiple times.. treo: Depending on the size, I load part of or the whole epoch and keep the records in memory in a list. Every time i refill the list, I shuffle it. TF has something similar in it\'s new input pipeline stuff (but i think that is deprecated again already). I find reshuffling helps a bit with the learning "getting stuck" (might be superstition, though). 

issue: matthiasamberg: as@raver119was hinting at, you can't have missing values when training a neural network. You will either have to drop that column / feature completely, or you'll have to decide what kind of placeholder value you want to use in that case 
solution: My point is that you don't set iterations any more. So you can simply remove that line of it was set to 1. If it was anything else you have to understand what you were actually doing there.. 

issue: Hello, I'm using 1.0.0-beta version of  dl4j. Method iterations() seems to be gone from NeuralNetConfiguration.Builder how do I set iterations now? ok, thanks! but I really don't see it :( thanks for explanation.

solution: with the given output per batch, it can fit about 12 in the interval, depending on your other listeners, esp. the gui, that additional time is probably spent there. 

issue: treo: Well, the decision upon the criteria is most often found by trial and error, as dumb as it may sound, as the data is pretty much raw numbers. 
solution: @KolyaIvankov If i were building an anomaly detection system, I'd probably start building it on top of an autoencoder like https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples/blob/master/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/feedforward/anomalydetection/VaeMNISTAnomaly.javaEven for time series data that approach can work well if you use a large enough window, what is enough depends on the problem, but it is usually an approach that does work.

[<-LINK->] AlexDBlack: Although it mentions NEpochs as 2, I executed it with 1. 
solution: 

issue: xiptos: yes. though of course you can configure it differently, to save it however you want (based on time, epochs, iterations, or some combination there-of) cool. I'll review soon xiptos: post your code in a !gist (or pastebin if you can't access gist) @tranvaso the final output = tanh(softmax(output_of_dense_layer_1))no, that's incorrectthere's only one activation function per layeranything set before .list() is global, but if you set something on a layer (like you are doing with softmax) it overrides it also, that code is using the old API - I'd suggest upgrading to 1.0.0-beta

solution: 

issue: yeah, looks like the HDF5 native (c++) libraries can't read the file within the JAR (which isn't too surprising, when you think about it :))I'd recommend one of two things (which are largely equivalent):(a) reading it from an input stream instead of the File(b) copying the file out of the JAR to a temp directory yes, I'm pretty sure it should work

issue: Hi, I have a question on how to speed up inference with my networks... At the moment, I am turning all inputs into double[], turning those into INDArrays via Nd4k.create(double[] data), and then giving that to the network. However it's awfully slow - how do your iterators handle this? Would it help if I kept re-filling the same INDArrays, instead of creating new ones for every call? With putScalar maybe? sorry Nd4j.create of course No, the data represents game states (it's for a strategy game AI). During training I had my data in CSV format and used the suitable iterators for that Well I can't speed up what the network is doing after I've handed it the inputs, and I assume that part is pretty optimized, so I figured the problem might be all that INDArray creation beforehand 
solution: 

issue: why don't you just use a profiler to see what exactly is taking the most time? Jvisualvm comes preinstalled with the jdk after all 
solution: The KFoldIterator is rather simple, it takes only a dataset and splits it into k pieces. Given the problem you're describing in your issue, I'd suggest that you simply skip using it all together. 

issue: hi, trying to open an hdf5 dl4j model and to save it using model serializer. i get an error that says:Error loading ND4J Compressors via service loader  [<-LINK->] treo: tried with java 8 and got same results...  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Is there a way I can optimize the hyperparameters even more in the code above? My brute-force implementation is outperforming DL4J and I suspect I'm not setting the DL4J implementation correctly. It is simply predicting LIGHT/DARK fonts against given background colors structured as R, G, B, and brightness values as inputs  [<-LINK->] 
solution: then, another thing about your network config: You aren't explicitly setting a loss function. Given that you're using two outputs instead of one, you should use softmax activation on your output layer along with multi class cross entropy as the loss function.. 

issue: treo: umm.. I was writing a comprehensive benchmark, and I randomly initialized my weights a few times and chose the best random initialization, and in dl4j I typed init() and then tried... why is my brute force method beating dl4j? 
solution: (I don't know who the other person is.) not really fair to joke, but I couldn't help myself. If I remember correctly it has to be this specific incantation, i.e. setInput, feedforward, etc... but file an !issue anyway, because that is a bad api anyway. 

issue: If I want to properly update my DL4J examples folder as well, do I only need to update the version numbers in the pom.xml of the examples-parent file, or those in the pom.xml of all the subfolders as well (datavec-examples, dl4j-cuda-specific-examples, etc)? raver119: Sorry, you mean a git pull on the dl4j-examples-parent folder? I haven't updated DL4J before and don't want to break my working setup. I also have a couple of modified examples in there hmm yeah i tried to just raise the version in the pom.xml, but then i got 41 compile errors afterwards. now i tried to git pull, but it says the pull failed because it can't create an index.lock file i am clearly messing this up

solution: however, keep in mind - this stuff isn't production ready - we're still working on it. 

issue: i'd still suggest you to get to the root of those dup words. gensim isn't supposed to produce those as well so it might be caused by some your parallel task maybe you' maybe you've used spark to process loads of word pairs etc so those dups might be processed properly i.e. averaged or something like that

issue: AlexDBlack: @agibsoncccthe problem with locking an issue is I can't respond. only trying to save you time, but you guys can look into fastText more at your leisure without my input sure there is, but I can see there's a bit of a disconnect with how I operate and how you guys want to operate, and that's totally fine. I'd say that if you look at fastText more deeply you'll see what I mean (or maybe you won't!) but I'll leave it with you guys. no hard feelings

issue: rickyhai11: see the link I just posted above :)you might need to do a small amount of mapping to go from RDD<DataSet> to PairRDD<K,INDArray> (basically, getFeatures, and assign a key)or, if you just have small amount of data you can pull it back to the driver ok, so you have an RDD<DataSet>are you familiar enough with Spark to map that to a PairRDD<K,INDArray>?the DL4J part is simple (DataSet.getFeatures())then call feedForwardWithKeythen you can do what you want (collect them to print, save them, etc) well, I'm not going to teach you spark :)the spark docs are goodas for mapping, it's trivial (at least if you know spark :)) [<-CODE->] then as I already said - it's justsparkNet.feedForwardWithKey(converted, 32);

issue: Hey all, has someone else tried early stopping training recently? Im using it on a classification model but it doesn\'t seem to work quite right. Whenever it stops training because no improvement was made for n epochs i evaluate the "best" (according to early stopping training) and the latest model. The latest model always does better on any given aspect as early stopping always thinks the initial model (epoch 0) is the best. Is this a known bug or do you think im doing something wrong? Its not super urgent, im just using regular training for now, just a heads-up. Thanks :) witht the classificationscore calculator that is

solution: 

issue: almair101: what gpu do you have? kivan-mih: there is no planned date as far as I know, but the -beta part is mostly about SameDiff and Tensorflow Import, so if you are holding off because of the name and are on an earlier version, you should still update ragnarok22: it looks like you've found a bug, as far as I can tell sample works only on DataSets for normal mlps, please file an !issue, or if you feel like you can do it, a pull request is always appreciated

Will there possibly be an issue while training the network? 
solution: 

issue: My data is already on a distributed file system, and the corpus is made up of slices. On a stand-alone basis, pulling data causes data communication. I still want to be able to do distributed W2V over spark

solution: 

issue: so regarding my question on EarlyStoppingTrainer in the newest dl4j version (wherefit()method does not callpretrain()now )  do I need to adapt something when training an autoencoder configuration withpretrain(true).backprop(false)? 
solution: lacic: as far as I can tell EarlyStoppingTrainer does not support pretraining. 

issue: raver119: , yeah I thought that might be the case too. My understanding of that output is that 9.2 is available but, that 9.0 is being used. Hey folks, having a "Please ensure that you have an nd4j backend on your classpath" error when trying to use my gpu. Details above. Help would be appreciated 
solution: almair101: he actually told you everything that you need to know: Make sure you have only a single cuda version installed. 

issue: almair101: if there's wrong cuda version install, or system can't find proper binary (which is the same) - you get unsatisfied link error which you see as "no nd4j backend" messagge what do you mean by "available"? there is - where? on nvidia website or in your system? can you please show me output of 2 commands

solution: 

issue: alexdiostia:  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] and if you want to reduce the size of the JARs just use "nd4j-native" instead of "nd4j-native-platform" (or equivalent for CUDA)(that\'s assuming you only want to deploy on the same OS that you build on) -platform includes binaries for all OSs volkanagun: just use embedding layerif you size the embedding layer to be the same same as w2v vocab, you can donet.getLayer("0_W").assign(<w2v weights>)post network initialization 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys, something I noticed now on the dl4j examples. Adapting the [<-LINK->] to use [<-LINK->] will not work in the latest version where pretrain is removed from the fit method. Is there a way to make it work or would that be a new feature request?

solution: 

issue: I came across this old repo, dl4j-spark-ml. I was curious if there are any future plans to work with SparkML pipelines and DataFrames, or what the alternative is? Is the DatasetFacade the intended way to interact with DataFrames? 
solution: OssamaAlshabrawy: it's planned, but won't be implemented until we add full support for Sparse tensors. But on bright side - that should happen soon.. it'll return you index of highest value along dimension. 

issue:  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: (I edited the code above to show the Interface definition,notmy implementation.) Well, theiteratorreturns multiple DataSet objects, so I thinknumExamplesis supposed to return the number of examples in thecurrentDataSet.  Anyway, since I generate my examples dynamically, there's no good way for me to determine the value to return fortotalExamples.  I thinknumExamplesmakes sense though, as I said above. 
solution: anyway, it's a bit ambiguous. As I said, it's legacy, something we haven't looked at in a whilefeel free to open an issue though and we can get it cleaned up (and improve the javadoc). the memory for INDArrays  is stored off-heap, so usually you want a sizeable fraction set for off-heapbut enough (but less) on-heap toobut it's network (and batch size) specific, there's no one-size-fits-all answer.

solution: 

issue: ok, so a few questions here(a) how are you measuring performance?(b) are you user that CUDA is being used (i.e., ND4J initialization shows CUDA for the K5200, not falling back to CPU or anything) argMax array: it contains the integer index of the maximum valueit supports a dimension argument, so you can execute it along a dimension too (at which point it'll give you multiple values, for each subset) I did look up the specs for the K5200, around 3 TFLOP vs. 3.4-5.1TFLOP for the 1060so it's slower, sure, but not too much slower than the 1060 rahul-raj: thanks, though I'm not seeing the code in that issue and yeah, I'm a bit backlogged on DL4J issues, haven't looked ath the other one yet oh, that's from early stoppingyou can't run early stopping without some sort of metric to evaluate the early stopping metric and arbiter metrics don't need to be the same thing (they are set independently)

issue: saudet: In case you still remember, that I asked you if the RL4J examples work well with the preconfigured parameters: Well, as you might guess, updating MKL also made that working for me too. ;) 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: First, thanks a lot. I will try that (Evaluation with new Regression())asap.Second, open an issue? Where (don\'t know) and what about? About, the ListDataSetIterator not able to be used in the "normal" RegressionEvaluation? Would not have thought about that, since I believe(d), I got it wrong there. Alex: changed the evaluation and it seems to work like a charm now. Thank you very much. 
solution: 

issue: Thank you so much@AlexDBlacki wouldve never figured that out myself! (Even though i shouldve suspected it as the exception said something about JSON, but i thought those annotations were optional haha) Really appreciate your help :) 
solution: I think ive had something like that before, for me the problem was that i had some NaNs in my dataset for some reason, you could check that if you havent already. 

issue: Hi, i've a question related to transfer learning. i use Darknet19 with round about 8000 learning images and 800 testing images. on my computer, one epoch needs 8h. my question is: is it possible to save the result of the frozen layers, so they need to calculated just ones and the later epochs do not need to read the images and calculate all the frozen layer stuff. 
solution: 

issue: ok, so before we debug this more, let's step back a seconddo you need to build the repo in the first place?is there a reason why you can't use releases or snapshots like 99.5% of other users? yeah, ok, so you skipped our quickstart and docs... could have saved a lot of time not trying to build :)  [<-LINK->] start thereand also !examples

solution: 

issue: Hi, Is there a good way to observe training accuracy (not just score/loss)? I have managed to get it to work using traininglisteners, but it is fragile and bordeline API-abuse, especially since preout is no longer stored in output layers Forgot to say that I want ot reuse the forward pass done in training. I can ofc just do another forward pass with the training data, but that would slow down the training by some 50% or so. Gist: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: treo: Thanks, I'm aware of the perils of looking at training accuracy and I kinda understand that you don't want to encourage it. Thing is that I want to plot model performace of training vs performance on validation set just for the purpose to spot signs of overfitting. Afaik, you don't get a score when evaluating so I would have to compare training score vs validation accuracy and this is not a very easy apples to apples comparision, especially if reglularization is embedded in the score (not sure it is, but I think I saw in the source code).

solution: 

issue: does that skip libnd4j compilation too though? (I would assume not) 
solution: 

issue: datavec does have some functionality for that in TransformProcess - it's not as easy to use as I would like, howeverit basically involves taking your data, filtering the missing values, calculating summary statistics, then doing a conditional replace on the original data

solution: 

issue: I'm pretty lost as to why my RNN is so ineffective with wordvectors. hm. 
solution: 

issue: has anyone here worked with training rnns on wordvectors? 
solution: The issue is that training gets nowhere at all when using wordvectors, while using a neuron for each word in the vocabulary works much better. 

issue: gegy1000: everything depends on what exactly you are doing. Usually you use word vectors only for the input, not for the output 
solution: 

issue: Since the features are scaled, they are going to be between 0 and 1, what should I do to make the network capture the small difference that it generates due to scaling?

[<-LINK->] AlexDBlack: Yep, these are my dependencies in my Gradle build file: [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: Ah thats great, i was wondering when they are released. But thats completely fine, need to do stuff for university before i can work on my own projects anways haha 
solution: 

issue: the 740m is pretty old, so it may be even slower to use it, if your network and data even fits in its memory 
solution: instead you can build an uberjar and rsync it there, that way only the very first upload will take some time. 

issue: what about maven build from direct source (git clone on server) and run the source file alone for testing the training? Thank youwill try out these options 
solution: 

issue: Hi!I have .h5 file which is a LSTM model. How can I use it to predict an output of LSTM. I will give an raw input now and will expect LSTM to generate some result using my existing h5 file (model). C0deAttack: thanks for your help. But the thing is, I went through the tutorial but unfortunately it is not helpful. For the purpose of my project I need to import H5 file that is created some where else. 
solution: 

issue: you've met an edge case here: LSTM supports a 2d shape, while SimpleRnn always requires a 3d shape, you'll have to reshape your inputs to be in 3d to get the example to run with simplernn e.g. something likenet.rnnTimeStep(testInit.reshape(1, LEARNSTRING_CHARS_LIST.size(), 1)); but don't expect the example to work great with it

Can't remember which.You can merge/concat at the network level though... use addInput for both readers, then just provide both as input to the relevant layrs nice, that's a pretty dramatic difference it could do, though not necessarilyCNNs can perform well in some time series applications, though they won\'t outperform LSTMs in all applications/datasetsso unfortunately the answer is "try it and see"

issue: Hello, could you give me an information? If I would try to run several threads passing the same W2V model to all of them, and if each of them have to call wordsNearest, would I run into bottlenecks because all of the thread are calling wordsNearest on the same model? 
solution: 

issue: I would like to process the weights of a MultiLayerNetwork net, which has a summary of:LayerName (LayerType)                   nIn,nOut  TotalParams ParamsShapelayer0 (SimpleRnn)                      200,200     80200     W:{200,200}, RW:{200,200}, b:{1,200}layer1 (RnnOutputLayer)                 200,71290   14329290  W:{200,71290}, b:{1,71290}Is it best to access the RW weights beginning at net.params.getDouble(offset), where offset=200x200? Or is there a better way?I believe the dl4j documentation says I can expect the layer.param() weights to be stored in "C order," with a stride of (200,1)?Also, I assume the weights are updated between training epochs when calls are made to net.fit()? Is that a good assumption? Thank you! Sorry@AlexDBlac, I was simply seeking to clarify accessing the recurrent layer weights in a MultiLayerNetwork using net.getLayer(0).getParam("RW"). I think I understand it, but I wanted to make sure I do. My assumption is that during training, the weights are initially random and then are adjusted at the end of each epoch. The weights are fixed during each time step when testing (not training). Thank you. 
solution: 

issue: raver119: sorry for late reply. The model is actually almost 4GB. I got no problems by launching lots of thread (16 at once), but the bottleneck happens as I expected. The reason is that for my experiments I need to iterate over nearest neighbours (I start from a certain "seed" word, get the first ten NN of a word, then the first ten NN for everyone of the previously obtained ten words and so on..). Now, since my pc runs a ryzen 7 1700 with 8 cores and 16 threads, I\'ve edited my code to run so that I could process 16 seeds at a time, but the execution time doesn\'t varies, so yes, there is bottleneck induced by the fact that all the seeds are getting the NN from the same model.

issue: Hey guys, could you help me a bit? I was trying to train a AE using EarlyStoppingTrainer with the newest dl4j version.After a short while I get a fatal error by JRE which is probably caused from nd4j. This is the log.Do you think that it could be something caused by me or a bug in nd4j? uhoh :D thx for the tip That with the "ND4J_SKIP_BLAS_THREADS" and  "OMP_NUM_THREADS" flags? Oh, I'll try the ND4J_FALLBACK

solution: 

issue: I am seeing a very strange thing. I am trying to predict continuous values and my training set looks like this:[640.0000,[    0.8127,    0.5826]]When I predict, the output is something like this 0.6853. What could be wrong? 
solution: for most activation functions their useful range is within -1 to 1 and their output range is within -1 to 1, and if you want to use any regularization at all, you also want the weights to be rather small, so creating large numbers from those small activations isn't in your best interest as well. 

issue: I guess you have normalized your data (if you didn't, you should) and you haven't de-normalized it after prediction? 
solution: 

issue: yeah, for regression, normalizing your labels to -1 to 1, 0 to 1 or N(0,1) distribution or similar is important then yeah, revert/unnormalize the predictions to get the 'true' predictions (in original scale)

issue: Looking for a little help.  I'm trying to run data through a pre-trained net. Does the VGG16 net take its image data in packed RGB floats or is it planar 224x224 Red followed by 224x224 Green, etc...   I'm assuming I convert my 8-bit rgb to [0-1] floats?Here's the gist of my code so far.  Let me know if I'm on the right track, or if I'm doing something wrong.  It runs, but I'm stumbling on the data conversion to get the predictions I'd expect.`VGG16 zooModel = VGG16.builder().build();computationGraph = (ComputationGraph) zooModel.initPretrained( PretrainedType.IMAGENET );int[] shape = new int[] {1,3,224,224};float[] imageFloats = new float[ 3224224 ];// -- TODO - put RGB image data into imageFloats --INDArray input  = new NDArray( imageFloats, shape, 0);DataNormalization scaler = new VGG16ImagePreProcessor();scaler.transform( input );INDArray output = computationGraph.outputSingle(input);String prediction = new ImageNetLabels().decodePredictions(output);`

issue: what could be the possible reason for this, given that my code doesn't have any early stopping condition:Hit termination condition on iteration 772: score=1.3868940353393555, oldScore=1.386899185180664, condition=org.deeplearning4j.optimize.terminations.EpsTermination Don't have any parallel gpu's on my server, so not using parallelwrapper in code [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: @rahul-rajwhat could be the possible reason for thisthat basically means "your gradients are 0 (or very close to) on that iteration"we\'ve removed it on master, fyi so it won\'t be logged on the next release (it\'s just notthat useful and users don\'t get it)I see a lot of these while running the code on my GPU server, here is the config:https://github.com/rahul-raj/Deeplearning4J/blob/master/src/main/java/AnimalClassifier.javaDo you observe any pitfall with the code?  [<-LINK->] Right now I see high error rate that is unchanged even after many iterations. I went through benchmark references and got a decent idea.  So my plan is to implement all benchmark stuff once I could reduce this error rate significantly. treo: Error rate was in the order of 0.10 or less before adding GPU changes.I just can't figure out what exactly wrong with the code this time. The only change in java isPerformanceListenerinstead ofScoreIterationListener,  but still observing the same. I will try and change some of the hyper parameters to see whether that works. treo: Okay.I will do some testing and get back I have filed an issue [<-ISSUE->] 
solution: 

issue: shaulz: I'll need to run that in the debugger, mind opening an !issue? 
solution: 

issue: rahul-raj: that may be caused by a lot of different reasons. One may be that your model just can't learn anything new from the data. Maybe all of your activations are saturated. Maybe it has overfit to the training data rahul-raj: when using cudnn the results may slightly vary from the CPU results as it may choose to use a bit more unstable algorithms in favor of speed but the results should vary that much

issue: Hi all - looking at using zoo.model.NASNet.  I have the output INDArray[], but when I decode using ImageNetLabels, I'm not getting the expected results.  Is there another set of labels I should be using for NASNet? I was able to get VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 to work, but NASNet and Xception don't seem to decode correctly.  For Object detect, I was able to get YOLO2 to decode with DarknetLabels.  Is there something similar for NASNet and Xception?

issue: raver119: for mixed sequence/non-sequence data, how about using mergeVertex I think it is a good solution for this problem raver119: i am referring the question from@newinai from your answer you have two approaches when mixing sequence and non-sequence data(1) duplicate the non-sequence data to every time step. That'll require a bit of manual coding on your part(2) join the data later in the networkI'd recommend starting with the latteryour network architecture would look something like: (using ComputationGraph)(sequence input) -> LSTM -> global pooling -> DenseLayer -> outputLayer(non-sequence input) -> DenseLayer -> outputLayernote that the last 2 layers are the same so after (sequence input) -> LSTM -> global pooling  i can be merge with non-sequence input then feed to the denseLayer 
solution: 

issue: tranva: MergeVertex can't merged different types of activationsall it does is concatenate them along dimension 1so you can combine N sequences, or combine N non-sequencesbut you can't mix the two as inputs to a MergeVertex cc@saudetI'm sure he'll get to it though. He (like all of us :)) has a lot going on

solution: 

issue: I see this example for feature reduction:https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples/blob/master/datavec-examples/src/main/java/org/datavec/transform/basic/CustomReduceExample.javaBut how do we go about data sets with large number of anonymized features ? Especially if I can't count the features  since there are many.I'm trying to figure out how to remove duplicate/constant value columns. 
solution: 

issue: Hello guys! I am learning with EarlyStopping using the parameter maxEpochsWithNoImprovement. Most of the cases the EarlyStopping stops the learning in the 5th epoch and the best epoch reported is 0, but I think it is not correct because I am checking the score in each epoch. Any idea? 
solution: 

issue: How do we reduce features from data sets, given that we can't use transformprocess with schema since we can't create schema by manually adding 4900+ features.And the  removal of constant columns can be done only this way:TransformProcess tp = new TransformProcess.Builder(inputDataSchema).reduce(new Reducer.Builder(ReduceOp.CountUnique)But since schema creation is impractical for data sets with large features,  can't think of this too. I'm stuck here and would like to hear your suggestions on this.

solution: 

issue: Is this the right place to ask questions about Nd4j as well? 
solution: 

issue: I have a super simple question that is just for validation on my part. Do the returned values (eigenvectors, eigenvalues) from PCA.principalComponents function return in the same order as each other? I believe they do, just want to make sure 
solution: Reason I am asking is that I must be misreading the implementation a bit. I am specifically looking at the pca2 function, and I am not sure how the top k (from the requested variance) is getting returned. It looks like eigenvalues are sorted in ascending order from the principalComponents function, but the return from pca2 uses the first set of eigenVectors, which I would assume have the least amount of variance. Am I reading this correctly?. 

issue: that i don't remember... is there a way to find without training again? that's exactly it's creating all the problem - loading takes so long, even after waiting for around at least 1 hour it doesn't even though i've 120 GB ram, and allocated around 76 GB for heap size 
solution: 

issue: are you on lastest version? 1.0.0-beta? 
solution: at least takes way too long time. and server (where writing and reading) is in beta. 

issue: raver119: hum :-/ where is the data conversion ? (string to numbers for the nn) ? this is not DataNormalization doing that ? or DataNormalization  takes only numbers in input ? and then normalize datas

issue: Hi, what is a good way to get the current learning rate from a Model (e.g. in a TraningListener)? I managed to ctrl+space into this:model.conf().getLayer().getUpdaterByParam("").getLearningRate(model.conf().getIterationCount(), model.conf().getEpochCount()), but it is kinda clunky and maybe there is a cleaner way. Not even sure it works since I don\'t want to interrupt current training to try it out. AlexDBlack: Thanks, I'll file an issue when I'm back at my computer

issue: I saw that from 0.9.1 -> 1.0.0-beta there are a few points regarding performance improvements in the releasenotes. Are there any code-changes that need to be done to take advantage of there improvements? Is compared the MNIST two layer example run on 0.9.1 with 1.0.0-beta and it seems to be a lot faster in the new version. Unfortenately that does not apply to my project as they seem to got a little bit slower with 1.0.0-beta.

solution: 

issue: @xiptosHi all! I'm sorry to ask, but is it possible to convert a DL4J model to coreml?no, we don't have any sort of coreml export or anything @MilanVancaIf I manage to find good hyper parameters for smaller MLP, can I assume it is fine to use them in bigger MLP?it's a starting point, but unfortunately no - optimal hyperparameters in one network are not in general going to be optimal hyperparameters in another network (especially if the architectures are very different)the closer they are, the more I'd expect that sort of thing to work daredemo: what to do mean "links"?like URIs to an image hosted on a web  server or something?at any rate, the current implementation requires images to be physically present (though symbolic links should work too I guess, never tried it) yeah, it should workwe're essentially just using Java File API underneath (listFiles, etc), which I'm pretty sure work fine with symbolic links

What I am trying to do is train an auto-encoder-like  architecture so I want to be able to give it latent space vector and have it give me output but those go in at the middle of the network not necessarily at the input. 
solution: 

issue: xiptos: i'm not sure if yolo3 is supported. but best thing you can do right now - file an !issue i think we've added something for that to master, but there are nuances. you must provide number of total datasets you have because fit method takes hypothetically endless iterator 
solution: 

issue: For large number of classes, I am not able to figure out which classes are excluded from training . Can you help me out with that? It gives number of classes but not the indexes 
solution: which classes are excluded from trainingare you referring to the output of Evaluation.stats() saying some classes are excluded?. rickyhai11: Basically: it means your data is too small after passing through some number of convolution layersyou might try setting .convolutionMode(ConvolutionMode.Same).

issue: tranva: from [<-LINK->] : "In machine-learning parlance, an epoch is a complete pass through a given dataset. That is, by the end of one epoch, your neural network – be it a restricted Boltzmann machine, convolutional net or deep-belief network – will have been exposed to every record to example within the dataset once. Not to be confused with an iteration, which is simply one update of the neural net model’s parameters. Many iterations can occur before an epoch is over. Epoch and iteration are only synonymous if you update your parameters once for each pass through the whole dataset." yasser-kfupm: try this channel: [<-LINK->] we can't tune your net for you. but we can give pointers. @/allwe created a wiki with all the random pages on the DL4J site here: [<-LINK->]

issue: I'm currenty working on a time series prediction using a RNN. Therefore I tried multiple updater and tested multiple learning rates / epsilons and momentums. Unfortunately, it seems that the epsilon or momentum does not have any influnce on the learning process. A screenshot of my results can be found here: [<-LINK->] . Is this an expected behaviour? AlexDBlack: I'm using the maven dependency 1.0.0-alpha. You can find the gist here: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: obviously the momentum parameter should have an impact on training for nesterov updater (only)what version of DL4J? And what's your network configuration (post in a !gist if you don't mind)? lkSnatch: no, you don't need to do manual resetting etc for those ops j-henning: you're setting the updater multiple times - only the last one will actually apply (as it will override any earlier updater config)

solution: 

issue: treo: No the activations stddev is 0 for the layer after few iterations 80-90. If I increase the learning rate and drop momentum, the activations are around 4000-5000. But as i can see the activations should be around 0.5 to 2.0. Is that log activations? 
solution: 

issue: hey guys, i am looking for active github repositories that need technical revisions in the README files. It is for a technical writing project. :) AlexDBlack: Thank you!

issue: I'm working on a RNN for a time series prediction. Currently,  I split the time series into thousands of label and feature files and use a SequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator to read them.  I'm considering writing a own DataSetIterator for speed improvements. I'm not completly shure if this would improve the speed because each DataSet has to be created multiple times with a lot of loops (I would use something like this to create a DataSet [<-LINK->] ). Is there a faster (cpu time) way to do this or is this the correct way? 
solution: you want to avoid putScalar where you canone approach is use an intermediate double[][] (or similar) and then use Nd4j.create(double[][]). Wouldn't that create a 2d ND4J array? I need a 3d array because I'm working with a RNN (sorry for not including the shape defintion: int[] shape = new int[]{5, 1, 10}; // {minibatch, valuesPerStep, sequenceLength}).

solution: 

issue: Hi, wondered if anyone could help me with a problem with loading classification data using SequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator. The label data is three columns wide by (sequence length). I just noticed that one of the columns in the INDArray is always set to '0' (if I dump it with toString()) but the other two are perfect. Wondered if this was a known bug. Can't find anything about it though 
solution: 

issue: added some new commits ! but i am not sure if they are visible on the main branch or do they need to be merged 
solution: 

issue: Sorry was in a skype meeting.But basically. I just need to have access within the cycle. I'm not completely sure everything that is going on within that cycle. And for this test we are doing. Everything has to conform. We try to take a really scientific approach to everything we do.So the training cycle needs to be as close to exact as the other three frameworks.Our current training cycle is.Each batch has two sets shuffled, training set accuracy is captured and validation set accuracy is captured. Then the backpropagation is preformed.And that needs to be the same across the board. Not on anyones word, but on our own implementation. We can't have any assumptions made on what is happening that process per framework. The rest of it I can't talk about, but that cycle needs to be transparent and conform to the others.

issue: Hi, looking for some direction on how to proceed.I want to use DL4J to do inference with my custom trained Yolo model.I have trained a Yolo net for my object classes using darknet (as described by the AlexeyAB YoloMark website).What's the right path for me to proceed to load this Yolo model (with my weights) into DL4J?For example, do I start with the Yolo model in the model zoo and somehow modify it with API calls, or is another approach more applicable?Any examples or pointers are appreciated!Thanks. AlexDBlack: Thanks for the pointer!  So if I understand it correctly, using (something like) YAD2K to convert the darknet model to a Keras model, and then using the KerasModelImport is the way to go.  And as you mentioned, the code in the YOLOv2 Javadoc is a good starting point for loading the Keras model.

issue: Hi, I'm testing Word2VecSentimentRNN with a set of tweets. I have noticed that modifying the variable truncateToLength from 256 to for example 50 affects the prediction of the results. I do not understand very well what is happening. Any suggestions? Thank you 
solution: 

issue: GeorgeNash: any reason you can't just use the indexing api? GeorgeNash: question for you: what parts of the nd4j docs or examples have you looked at? I'd like to make that more obvious..we've put that out there in a few places now right ok so it's the NDArrayIndex content in the userguide sorry here: [<-LINK->] wrong one :) 
solution: so now that we\'ve established some references and a common language - the way I would would consider doing it would be looking at how you want to split up your array..so you want concat along subsets and you want a reverse of that..you would basically have to iterate over each "slice" to get what you want.

issue: svvashishtha: what do you mean debug vs release build? are you building from source for some reason? we have android builds already also we have an android page: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: svvashishtha: That's most likely ProGuard stripping out stuff it shouldn't. There's some information about the kinds of things we can do for that here: [<-LINK->] must be something missing then  ) ProGuard gets executed only for release builds svvashishtha: should work, but something might have changed, and this wasn't updated in particular, anything that applies to org.bytedeco probably also applies to org.nd4j 
solution: in one of the example of multidimensional layer this one declared as.setInputTypes(InputType.convolutional(60, 160, 1)). Why the parameter depth is declared only 1 instead of 3 for RGB values?. 

issue: Hello,@raver119Is it possible to retrain word2vec?I tried something like this: [<-LINK->] to retrain the model but it does not work. It gives the following results where the weights seem to be 0 now: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: is there actually any case where oneshoulduse that method? I'd actually vote to deprecate splitTestAndTrain, since I've never seen a case where it is useful beyond toy examples agibsonccc: since people tend to confuse examples with best practices, I guess that we shouldn't even use that function there 
solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: I'm sorry to ask you this, but I can't find in the logs generated by my little proof of concept that information you tell me about when you initialise ND4J. 
solution: agibsonccc: @AlexDBlackhere you go : [<-ISSUE->] let us know if you need more specific information. Thanks again for you quick answers.. 

issue: I want to build a JAR that depends on nd4j and was planning to create one JAR per OS (linux, windows, mac) so that the downloadable artefact would be smaller but I can't figure out how to only pull in only one runtime. I tried following the instructions from here - https://nd4j.org/dependenciesIs it advisable/possible to do this and how do I do it if so? mneedham: oh I think I might have figured it out. Gonna give it a try....ignore me for now :) 
solution: 

issue: hi again just a small question is Word2Vec compatible with Cuda ? ( CudaEnvironment.getInstance().getConfiguration().allowMultiGPU(true); ) ? agibsonccc: so, why it's not useful ? :p 
solution: 

issue: @AlexDBlack thanks for the response.@saudet thats good news. However I used 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT jars and tested on instance which had glibc 2.12. ND4J initialization failed. An exception was thrown because of older version of glibc (libc.so.6 file). It was not the error shown in stack trace. I saw this error message while debugging.Should I be rebuilding libdn4j on instance with glibc 2.12? If yes, I am seeing the error: g++: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1plus)GCC version used: 4.9, glibc 2.12, CentOS 6.9 saudet: sure I will give it a try. Thanks

solution: 

issue: @saudet@blockheads you'll need to tune the parameters Sorry what do you mean by parameters, parameters to what, excuse my ignorance, I have tried changing so many things but it seems to get stupider and it's starting to make me stupider too I think. 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: wrt schedule - haven't touched DL4J for a long time ;) looks like the change list between 0.9.1 and 1.0.0-beta is quite impressive 
solution: agibsonccc: are you aware of (numeric) issues which could cause a network to predict labels it has never before seen? I have 1-hot encoded label vector which is like 70 elements wide but only 43 of these are ever used during training. Still during prediction element indices > 43 are predicted. 

issue: @saudet & channel: Just wanted to let you know I figured out the remaining video issues with my little robot and it is happily bouncing off the walls (literally) and saving/restoring the DQNPolicy between runs. It's still in the highly randomized portion of the training, so, no idea how well it's learning yet, but we'll see.  It has started stripping the tire axles, so will need some physical maintenance, but nothing some superglue can't fix, and I may swap out the DC motors for some steppers anyway.Thanks for the time and advice!  I'll post some pictures/video at some point and link it in here.

issue: Hi. I am trying to deploy a pretrained model on my Android app. The neural network uses inputs of size 28 X 28 to tell whether if an object that my model was trained on is in the camera frame or not. I get the image from camera API and convert into required format. How do I pre-train my model? There doesn't seem to be a lot of resources to do that online. Can I do that in python and import the weights and use the same neural network architecture?

solution: 

issue: 1.0 beta. Should I try a stable one ? My probleme is that I also want to use the YOLO example wich seems to work only on that version. 
solution: anyway, only guess here is that you might be running into a recently-identified bug with CuDNN + same padding modeit's been fixed on master/snapshotsyou can check if you're running into that by executing training without cudnn (or, just upgrading to snapshots)if it works properly - try !snapshots to get the fixif not - open an !issue and I'll take a look.

solution: 

issue: wiku: is there some tutorial for it? I cannot find any... Now I am developing a neural net in IntelliJ, but it has lot of libraries (like OpenBLAS, JavaCPP) ... I am just looking for a solution, where lightweight important libraries are used to restore NN and do a computation on CPU ... I need it because I am programming an app in 3rd party software which provides some api and there are some limits... agibsonccc: In fact, I am new in DL4J, I wanted to use Encog but there is lack of GPU, but DL4J provides GPU learning so decided for this. Encog has some lightweight .jar files which I can easily import to that 3rd party software... I just save there model and in that 3rd software i will load it and do a computation... But here it seems to me little complicated... If I run SKIL then (if I understand it correctly) I have to make REST communication - that's ok ... But there are some hw requirements, I need Docker because I am on Windows and so on... For simple model it seems little complicated.... Also in 3rd party software I need to upload dependent .jar files one by one becuase it does not use maven... With HTTP communication there can be also problem.... 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: by nature what you mean? I can describe it little more... It\'s a trading platform written in Java... It provides an API for writing a strategy (automatic trading)... So simply, I would like to my "pack" my trained model (.zip with weights) with that strategy... And in the strategy I will restore the model, enter the prices into inputs and compute output.... Yeah, I don\'t need it as a service, but if there is no other option, I will try it that way... 
solution: You should just need fat jar and an nd4j backend then.

issue: Hi, I'm having issues getting DL4J to run on my GPU.  After trying to use Dependency Walker on the offending line (Loader.load(org.bytedeco.javacpp.cudnn.class);) it pops up, but no dependencies are missing.  my errors are these: [<-LINK->] I've got the GPU integration working with keras and tensorflow (through Python) so I don't think it's a problem with my setup.  I have tried the no workspace, as someone here suggested it may be a memory issue. 
solution: 

issue: After a clean removal of everything and a reinstall, similar errors are present. However, if I integrate CUDA onto the non cuda-specific examples, they work well (on the GPU).  Even moving the cuda example that I was using, it still fails with similar errors. I didn't see that 9.1 support was dropped, so that's probably why it wasn't initially working.Thanks for the help@agibsonccc

solution: it is slow for me to take a second or twoit's a one-off initialization cost, once per JVMonly way that's an issue is if you're starting/stopping JVMs all the time (which is usually bad for performance, with or without ND4J). 

issue: i'm using nd4j in some online server, but it is too slow to init. Is there any function ti init those op?

solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: I need some suggestions/advice as regards what to do, As per my requirements my initial plan was a CNN with 10 layers ,1 fullyconnectedlayer and 1 outputlayer for  the 448x448 images and my training data is about 14GB.... what do you think I should do? 
solution: definitely use a CNN, not an MLPif you can, go smaller on the images - 448x448 is pretty large (most imagenet models are around 224x224 for comparison)... you'll save a ton of memory by doing thatcan't say in general if 10 layers is suitable - it's task and dataset (and to a degree, hardware) specific. 

issue: 54LiNKeR: keep in mind, parallel training efficiency depends not just on your training data size, but also time spend on 1 iteration over 1 batch i mean - if your model spends, say, 5ms per batch, there will be 0 sense trying to use spark

Is there a config for combining Arbiter with early stopping conditions?

issue: CuriousNikhil: I did and it is just as you would use any other Java library. Simply add it as yet another dependency and you are good to go (see [<-LINK->] for a quick start with Java) DL4J uses a native backend just like the python based libraries so there is pretty much parity between them.

issue: Hey guys, been looking around a bit and can't seem to find any posts or articles on it. With the exception of theano though, to be completely fair, it is a fairly hidden or not common topic amongst all of the framework documentations.But I was just wondering if anyone know hows to set and get the raw weights and biases of layers. sure, I'll try to get and set some weights, and read up on the params stuff real quick first. 
solution: Codie-Petersen: with DL4J, you've got paramTable() method on MultiLayerNetwork/ComputationGraph, for all params as a Map<String,INDArray>or you can do getLayer(x).paramTable() for just the params for that layer. 

issue: AlexDBlack: In my model, I can leave "Dropout (0.5)", I understood.So, in my model arbiter, if I can not use "Dropout", does this have an impact on the results? Because my two models will not have the same configuration (one with dropout and the other arbiter without). AlexDBlack: hum, you want i open an issue ? AlexDBlack: (i just put    // .dropOut(0.5)          in my arbiter model)

solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: Can you please take a look at my question regarding ParagraphVector? Also, Can I train a ParagraphVector from an existing Word2Vec? I tried ".useExistingWordVectors(vec)", but it gives an error. 
solution: you can't get model with weights only and use in paravec. 

issue: it's not common to do that, but I don't see why notEarlyStoppingTrainer has overloads for already initialized nets (i.e., MultiLayerNetwork) there's not much to show... [<-LINK->]

solution: 

issue: Running into some memory limitations (obviously, it\'s deep learning). I\'m doing aparagraphVectors.inferVector(s)and wanted to explicitly "deallocate" the INDArray after use. Is there a way to do this? I've triedvector.detach()but it does not seem to be within a WorkSpace...(vector.isAttached()is false). Should I explicitly be creating a Workspace before loading ParagraphVectors/WordVectors from disk? Also looked atvector.cleanup()but that seems to be deprecated (as of1.0.0-beta2at least). Tracing through ParagraphVectors => SequenceLearningAlgorithm => DBOW, ultimately the allocation isNDArrayFactory.createUninitialized

solution: 

issue: tranva: that's definitely one of the more challenging types of pipelines to buildthinking about it, you might have to build a custom iterator(normally we suggest people avoid custom iterators, but I can't think of a clean way to build that pipeline using standard datavec features) though, what's the format of the original data? i.e., how do you know which image/CSV lines go together? yeah, given that: you might be able to extend CSVRecordReader and override next() (and have batchesSupported() return false) the idea is it starts with Text writables, and you substitute an NDArrayWritable for the images batch support in the reader has nothing to do with network configuration if enabled, it'll attempt to pack everything into an INDArray which you can't do with strings :) i.e., only works with fully numerical data RecordReaderMultiDataSetIterator can deal with true/false for batchesSupported batching will be done internally by RRMDSI for you 
solution: I think this also work. I would try to extend the ImageRR to ImageRR.build(List<Path>, List<Label>).

issue: @marioarrigonineribut in this way original images and transformed ones are not shuffledit's an example showing how to do both, just take the second segment note also that the transforms can be applied randomly i.e., random probability of being applied or not so fit for more epochs? 
solution: it's not necessary to override anythingif you want data augmentation, apply random transforms, and fit for multiple epochsthat's the standard approach. 

issue: Does DoublesDataSetIterator support batches? When I set batch size to 1, it takes several minutes to train one epoch, but when I set it to 1000, it trains in half a second. Is the speed-up because it's only using one example and skipping the other 999, or is it because it's running all 1000 examples in that batch concurrently? I'm using CUDA, but it's hard to believe that it's THAT much faster. raver119: is there any point to using ParallelWrapper to train a model when I only have 1 GPU and 1 CPU?

I\'m doing some experiments with (home brewed) weight pruning. I think I have gotten the dimension stuff right but after a few pruning rounds (e.g. train, prune, train etc) I get the following crash: https://gist.github.com/DrChainsaw/7552fde7c9318891b5b1428147b6e12f.I\'m using the transferlearning API to replace layers but using homebrewed logic to "traverse" through pooling layers (eg the globalpooling one which is part of the trace) i.e. I\'m not using nOutReplace. Also use homebrewed logic to "transfer" weight arrays from old arch  to new. 
solution: hm... first thing: try it on CPU, you might get a different (and more useful) exceptionand it might be worth trying to disable workspaces, in case you have some sort of array workspace leak in there somehow.... 

issue: I have a too much code, however I can add a note, I just realized that the big change form the previous to the current custom function is the increased number of labels. Before I was just doing sub between two INDArray, now what changed is that I am doing sub between one INDArray and the first row of another INDArray.Is there something I should check? I read in the documentation that there is a difference between c (row wise) and fortran (column wise), I packed my abels in rows without checking the format, can it be a problem?

Rather, what's the standard way to handle that in DL4J? A simple argmax call doesn't work because I'm not simply looking for the highest output value in the sequence

issue: TheFileSplitconstructor has an argumentrandomto shuffle the files.I wonder about the best practices to do this in training.Is it generally good to shuffle or are there cases where it is beneficial to not shuffle (e.g. when using batch normalization and the images tend to be grouped by similarity). And why are theFileSplitconstructors with argumentsrandomandrecursivemutually exclusive (2 ctors - one allows to specify random, the other one recursive, but not both)?

Is there some step I\'m missing? sorry for bad formating When I ran./mnistCUDNNit shows Test passed. I have oracle jdk8, used maven 3.5.4 to install deeplearning4j examples. So why the example with cudnn thinks it is not installed. btw i have installed cuda in /opt/cuda path, not in /usr/local/cuda.  [<-CODE->] 
solution: 

issue: Hey guys, I'm wondering if I can re-use old training data for rl4j. Is there a way to use data stored by the DataManager? 
solution: 

issue: I have installed cudnn on linux. When verifying according to nvidia guide the sample outputs Test Passed. I did not set any variable you mention  [<-CODE->] Here is the upper part of log. So I guess it detects nvidia and cuda right. 
solution: And cudnn should speed up the learning process.. I guess that\'s then a question for the Dl4j team. In theory, yes. But as always "it depends", size of samples, etc.. 

issue: Why not write an iterationlistener and adjust it accordingly? 
solution: yeah that could work, didn't think of that. easy to implement and I assume this would do the job. Currently, I use a filelistener and a config file; so if you dev. such a listener, feel free to share ;).

issue: Hi there,implementing my thesis in java, quite advanced reinforcement learning technique. I would love to use dl4j. What am I struggling is to find some good example of RL with data handling and training (dense network is fine for now, what I need is to understand how data iterators and fetchers work). Problem is that my dataset is changing all the time since it is RL and so I need full control on dataset. I was checking some of your examples, but they are very deeply encapsulated that I can't see the whole picture. Is it ok to just create BaseDataIterators and Fetchers all the time from sampled episodes? Or are there (I bet there are) some nice tricks for changing datasets over time 
solution: 

issue: Cool, I will try that idea now.I see what you mean in the HouseNumberDetection.java. Are the locations of the objects in the example relative to the final grid of h=13 w = 13, or to the pixel location of the image itself? because I think I do not understand this from the papers

solution: 

issue: I tried batch normalization, but it seems I've done it wrong, or it's not right for my model. Here's my implementation of it: [<-LINK->] When compared to the exact same model without the batch norm, the error gets very low. With batch norm, it doesn't converge as well and it converges erratically. Are you only supposed to use Batch Norm on ConvLayers or can you also use it for FeedForward layers? 
solution: in Principle you can use it with every layer type,  but you have to remember that introducing it requires retuning of all other hyper parameters. 

issue: what do you recommand for a Standard Deviation (log 10) of -1 approx ? (activations) 
solution: 

issue: I tried a multi-task learning (1 input sequence with 2 output sequences). However, when I called the evaluation (computationGraph.evaluate(MultiDataset, Map(0  ->  EvaluationMethod, 1 -> EvaluationMethod) ). The first output layer works fine. But the second one still uses the first output layer's labels, saying the label's dimension != prediction's dimension.  Any suggestions?

issue: Is there a way, using memory mapped files, to store data for later immediate reading? My dataset is too large to load into RAM and so I'm looking into batch loading it. Currently it's serialized into a file, but I can easily switch over to a different serialization method since the deserialization time is my bottleneck. The way I understand memory mapping is that it's stored as a file in such a way that it can be used by your program but never actually takes up any RAM. I also understand that it's only a temporary file, which I'm hoping is configurable so that it can persist through script instances. treo: That's unfortunate. I'm sure I'll find a way to make it work, was just hopeful that there was direct support for it. Ty.

issue: sorry, what I meant is I considered filing an issue for this, but browsing the names of your repos I guess I expected the zeplin notebooks and/or docker containers to have their own repos. So I wound up here :) 
solution: nsoft:  [<-LINK->]. 

issue: diskspeed is actually an issue when you load a lot of data from disk or use mmaped files to not having to keep less often used stuff around in memory and nlp (=text) type problems can eat up lots of ram as well I had to upgrade from 16 to 32

issue: It's not GAN. Is there a plan to provide GAN examples? 
solution: tranva: I don't believ crop will change size of box (as that would change the center, which isn't what we want)but you should double check source to be sure.

issue: In 1.0.0-beta2 I can't get the ImageRecordReader with multi labels get working because of a Ecxeption in BaseImageRecordReader. I've got label counts from 1 to 5. Is the code there possibly causing problems because of different col numbers: [<-CODE->] If there is an alternative to apply ImageTransforms that would be good too, before I had own code to generate 1 channel INDArrays,  but now I need to add ImageTransforms. 
solution: 

issue: Is there a computationally less expensive alternative to someINDArray.putRow(i, highDimensionalINDArray)? I'm effectively compiling several INDArrays into a batch. Is there a way to optimize my process? first I create a container INDArray with shape [batchSize, componentShape], then I add each component to the container  INDArray using putRow() as shown above 
solution: 

issue: Well you can try to deploy smth similar to HDInsigh with docker and k8s, and in this case updating the lib should not be a problem Actually, you already mentioned some possible solutions in your question... In case of real VMs updates could be done with Ansible or similar tool...Also, don't forget that real VMs (not provisioned as worker for k8s or some other orchastration tool) would neednvidia-dockertool to be install to pass-through GPU to container... You can try to do a quick test with docker + gpu + dl4j with Azure AKS service

The error says [<-CODE->] This is how I implemented the Evaluation function: [<-CODE->] as you can see, I've tried two methods but it doesn't work. I've search for some related issue but that doesn't help much. Thanks. 
solution: np-one: are you sure you set snapshots up correctly?both your error and network configuration looks exactly like the one from that issuetry building and running it from maven if you are using an IDEif it's still a problem, then give me a complete minimal example that I can run in an !issue and I'll take a look.

issue: Hey guys, just a quick question regarding hardware for Dl4j. I'm about to buy a geforce RTX. Now I am questioning myself which CPU is best, intel or amd, i.e. many cores vs. max core speed. So if I run Dl4j on my GPU, would like 8 cores at high CPU frequency (say 4ghz+) or 32 cores, less fast, be more effective? Thanks!

solution: 

issue: hello from vienna. im struggling with building the dl4j libraries using dedicated jars of spark, scala, ... i have installed zeppelin 0.8.0, many things are already there. but i dont have a clue how to tell maven that it should use this libs instead of building and packaging other versions to prevent version conflicts. the only solution for this i can see so far is getting rid of maven and using ant. 
solution: x12r13: if you want to use zeppelin with DL4J using SKIL is the easiest was to go since they have taken care of the exact problem that you are having there. If you are just looking for a notebook based workflow using beakerX maybe the easier solution.

solution: 

issue: I'd still say just use PI. Models are not thread safe. INDArrays aren't either. Use !gist for code blocks in that same !gist put your actual error log a vague "OOM" without us seeing something doesn\'t mean much There could be a variety of reasons it's failing How are you running it?

issue: thanks@agibsonccc.  Sorry to sound whiny, but so this has been a major blocker for us, and we can't have 8 million, 1 kB csv files for our string classification project (4m features files, 4m labels files).  The one recommendation for it was to use mapfiles, and I spent a lot of time and complexity to try to figure that out, it got through 44 epochs with zero performance improvement then segfaulted.  I'm sure I did something wrong.  But it's very frustrating.

issue: How does dl4j distribute all the inference operations of a NN over multiple cores? I was surprised it ran so fast (10k mnist test in 10s) given all the layers but I noticed all cores are 100% maxed out. agibsonccc: Thanks, it's the multithreading strategy that DL4j uses that I'm trying to understand.

issue: basically, there\'s really only 2 options that I\'m aware ofeither use "non-platform" artifacts (gives you single OS artifacts)or use classifiers to include only the ones you wantno "-platform/everything except android" - unless maven exclusions allow you to specify classifiers? (not sure on that one tbh) that's single platform/OS again though AFAIK 
solution: so the ".none" switches off all dependencies on natives - how to I need to set e.g. thejavacpp.platform.macosx-x86_64propertyin the POMto turn it back on? I ask because I would like to avoid having to specify a flag on the maven command line. hum, you're right, I'll need to update that... for now we can specify at least one with something like-Djavacpp.platform=linux-x86_64. 

issue: mankeskes: can you clarify why you think it recreates the buffer every time? arr.data() returns a constant reference In general, we don't expect people to use getDouble(int) unless they have to. We expect people to use the indexing api if they want ranges 
solution: For most things where you need that kind of efficiency you can look at using something like our opencv integration, arrow for columnar data, javacpp has ffmpeg and co.

issue: uccollab: ok, first guess here: you probably have mixed versions of DL4J/ND4J on your classpathusuallyyou'll get a big warning about that when you run your program (but not always)how are you managing your dependencies? maven? 
solution: 

issue: In the process of spark-based average parameter training, is the updating of adaptive learning rate performed on the master node by integrating the gradients of all slave nodes? That is to say, the master node is responsible for updating the learning rate by calling the ADAGRAD algorithm and distributing it to the slave nodes in every iteration. Is my understanding right? Thank you@AlexDBlack, but I doubt the rationality of this parallel approach from a theoretical point of view when the updaters (optimizers) like adagrad are applied on each node. Have you done some relevant theoretical deductions? Thank you@AlexDBlack 
solution: 

issue: wmeddie: Thanks for getting back to me... I do want to do distributed training... What is the difference between using a SKIL cluster and a spark cluster? I thought once I created the SKIL cluster, everything else would cluster with it including spark... Can I get away with just using a spark cluster only??? I wrote a java application, so if I could connect directly to a spark cluster for training, that would be fantastic! AlexDBlack: Thanks for your help! 
solution: 

issue: P00LDEAD: the main benefit of skil there is not needing to write the training code yourself. Skil connects to external spark clusters like emr. You pick a provider and schedule the job. The other is everything integrated right with the zeppelin You also dont have to build the uber jar for dl4j Skil also comes with built in experiment tracking for the training

The latter is the one you actually want @koljamaier I'd strongly suggest updating... you're using a version (0.9.1) that is 15 months out of datehave a look at our release notes: https://deeplearning4j.org/release-notes.htmlI didn't need to change the activation/loss functions thothe fact that you didn't get an error (in 0.9.1, you would get an exception in later versions) doesn't mean that softmax + nOut(1) isn't completely wrong for a number of reasons. I'd strongly recommend changing that to something suitable for regression (like identity + MSE)

issue: not predicting one of the labels is usually an overfitting problem thorsanvil: it would probably be easier to just write your prepared data into a (or multiple) hadoop map file and then just read it with a record reader later on? well, an INDArray is backed by a chunk of memory, so if you are manually creating lots of them and discarding lots of them you are probably actually waiting for your OS memory allocator why would you want to take it apart? yes, If you can actually load all your data into memory and have enough space left to train, then I think passing a pointer a view on the sub arrays is probably the easiest, if you can't I think you'll want to only load as many as you want to have in a batch at once, and pass this on to your DataSet objects

[<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] Hi, I've updated to 1.0.0-beta3, but still getting large spikes in the model score during training Model architecture: [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: agibsonccc: it's in the gist there (I missed that too)@human098ok, so first thing: this is obviously using a quite old version of DL4J there based on the config, I'd suggest using the latest (1.0.0-beta3)if it still occurs with 1.0.0-beta3, then we'd need to know more about the data to debug this 
solution: 

issue: Very silly question, how do I download the latest version? I have Maven installed, but can't remember how to do it 
solution: I've been using maven since 2009. That's how you get paid to write java. Similar systems (gradle, sbt ,..) etc are also worth using..

[<-LINK->] AlexDBlack: With Zeppelin I do not have any error message, only error is written next to the run button. Should I run the files with IntelliJ instead? As for the version, it should be Version 1.0.0-beta3Thank you AlexDBlack: I understand. Would it be possible to know how to run the tutorial files with IntelliJ/Eclipse as the tutorial files are json or ipynb? Unfortunately I could not find the answers on the web and the tutorial only suggests Zeppelin ^^' 
solution: 

issue: KareiRice: please just use our !examples repo we already have a ton of end to end examples of dl4j you can look at What are you trying to do? We had a zeppelin docker container were supporting for  a while but we found it harder to maintain. (Mainly just due to lack of bandwidth and little users) We have a !start page ^ 
solution: 

issue: yeah, for "all data in one DataSet object" type fitting (aka not minibatch training), then iterations and epochs are the same thingif you use StatsListener constructor with frequency arg with lower value, you should see it in UI(of course, <10 fitting iterations is probably an issue on its own, but separate issue...) and yeah, an evaluation UI is planned, just not high priority for us to build right now totally want to add it though

issue: AlexDBlack: I\'m looking to remove my "hacks" around the workspace stuff. I find that in MultiLayerModel.scoreHelper, there is now some Workspace-lines. However, I am puzzled by this line:INDArray inputToOutputLayer = outputOfLayerDetached(training, FwdPassType.STANDARD,layers.length-2, data.getFeatures(),  data.getFeaturesMaskArray(), data.getLabelsMaskArray(), null);The "null" there is the argument \'outputWorkspace\'.In my "reimplementation" of this method (as in: Copy, and modify one single bit), that argument was literally the single thing I changed, to include a Workspace I run my evaluation in. Thus, I am puzzled that it is still \'null\' in the beta3 ? Hmm. I see that inside the outputOfLayerDetached, there are also tons of workspace-related stuff. I guess I should just close my eyes here. I'll test it and see if I get that blowup I got last time. Good. But this is not model.score(), though? But I see when testing that I do not get the blowups I got before, so evidently it works - I was just about to delete my utterances here.

solution: 

issue: Does anyone know any example that utilizes theLossMultiLabel,?When I use this, LossMultiLabel, in my network, I get all NaN. Using the LossBinaryXENT I get a somewhat working model. treo: I read the doc, I understand the doc. All thats missing is the LossLayer to work in a simple 3 deep network with labels as [lb1,lbl2,lbl3,lbl4] where lblx is binary 0 or 1. treo: To give more context, the network works fairly well with a LossF of LossBinaryXENT and a activation sigmoid. All I did was replace the LossBinaryXENT with a LossMultiLabel and removed the activation since the doc said its not needed. treo: And all I get as a score is NaN. So has anyone actually tested this to work in DL4J? And if so, would this information please be passed on somehow?

issue: javadev-berlin: layerwise unsupersived training + spark needs some work, it's on my to-do listin most cases it doesn't make a huge amount of sense to do unsupervised layerwise pretraining in a distributed mannerand by the sound of it you are only running single node with 1 GPU, at which point you definitely shouldn't be touching spark at all, use spark only if you have and need a cluster CedricReichenbach: might also give you some ideas for things to check: [<-LINK->] it's on the very large size, and will result in increased memory and slower computationunless there's a good reason to have that high resolution, I'd suggest starting with a smaller resolutionand then maybe compare the performance with the higher resolution and see if it's worth the extra time/memory Liujish931: I'm not 100% sure, but I think it's in npy format, not pickled coolbeevip: maybe have a look at this: [<-LINK->]

issue: Hi everyone, I have a working image classifier working with v0.9.1, currently using GoogLeNet. I would like to trade accuracy for inference speed as my main concern is classification throughput not accuracy. I was thinking the best option might be to try and import a mobilenet model? Does that make sense? I'm new to all this so apologies if these questions are dumb, just don't want to head in the wrong direction. Thank you! 
solution:

solution: 

issue: Hey, I can't seem to find this documented anywhere: Is it correct thatComputationGraph#outputalways returns normalized data? If so, can I somehow output raw forward pass results, skipping normalization? 
solution: and it basically depends on your output layer and its activation function what exactly will be returned. if your input is vector, and model is non-rnn.

[<-CODE->] How do you increase the amount of layers? and so the size of the double[] oooh, i see, thanks alot for pointing at them. Do you advise using your own ObservationSpace or just using one of their premade ones: [<-LINK->] 
solution: if it's a custom problem, you are probably better off implementing it, should be quite easy as it seems to me as it serves only to define the boundaries of the state encoding.

issue: Is the moving Window implementation for training examples not meant to support multiple labels? 
solution: back in days, in 2014 it w2v + moving window was hit. Well I guess that's true. Convolutional networks take so long to train though. We've got massive amounts of data to feed in.

issue: Hi everyone, I worked with my CPU before and I'm trying to make my code working with GPU, particularly my LSTM. However I can't get cudnn to work with my gpu, lstmhelper is not instantiated. Cudnn is installed and tests have been passed. I tried to pass dl4j's examples, mnist and LSTMCharModellingExample, but I have an error, it looks like it does not find cudnn [<-LINK->] , I have cuda 10,  cudnn 7.3 and beta3 dl4J version. thank you Thank you, now the example works, however I had the right dependency in my code and  it looks like there is no error.

issue: i am looking for cnn-lstm examples pretty sure i saw it before but cant find it now hmm as i remember there is a layer to convert cnn output to rnn input that what i am lokking for 
solution: 

issue: HJFS: that depends on your dataset, is it csv? The reason we have "dataset" in there is because our memory allocation and everything else is different If it's just a matrix, a dataset object is just 2 matrices where you can do something likenew DataSet(Nd4j.create(double[][]),Nd4j.create(double[][])); We have a spark.ml module you can look at as well Ultimately if you\'re coming from the numpy world, nd4j is "numpy" A "row" object if it\'s a vector (which it should be) would just be Nd4j.create(double[]) So just convert your float to a vector and do a map function over those It should only be like..2 extra lines of code to do For your "labels" though, note that it depends on what you\'re doing. A dataset serves every use case and it\'s raw linear algebra so the labels depend on what you're doing We can't make that assumption on your behalf

solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: @raver119is it still possible to assign the weights of a Word2Vec lookup table to an EmbeddingLayer like in this case [<-ISSUE->] the methods for getting weight parameters now return a double, which makes it unlikely for one to use .assign(INDArray) as before perhaps the INDArray has to be converted to doubles for it to work? mo3pheus: alrite mate, have you gone through this yet? [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: octocode686: you can specify your own distribution too...what are you trying to do though? Not even most research papers need a custom init ahh I see the embedding layer So you're trying to load word2vec in to an embedding layer? 
solution: All you're doing is cherry picking vectors from it anyways.  It's separate because you often don't want to load a whole word2vec on to a gpu, let alone do you need it in memory, so we often memory map embeddings separately from the neural net.

issue: pskarthic: checkpoint listener hasn't gone anywhere, no changes there in many releases 
solution: 

issue: When I input RNN data to my network in format [size, timesteps], it tells me I need 3d data, does that mean [batch, size, timesteps]? This is with LSTM.Also when I reshape my data and masks to rank 3 [batch, size, timesteps], it tells me the mask needs to be rank 2... what? treo: alright, that makes sense. Reshaping to add an extra rank on my input data is fine. What really bugs me is why when I do that I get an error telling me that the mask array must be rank 2 oh wait you mean masks array still needs batch at rank 0 but skip the size and use timesteps at rank 1? so [batch, timesteps] for mask? 
solution: if you are outputting at every timestep, but you don't have labels for each timestep, you've got to do something about that, and that is where masking comes in. 

issue: @C4N4D4M4N I've updated the example to use setInputType, plus added some comments on what is happening with activation shapeshttps://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples/pull/797/files@AlexDBlack but nOut is still set manually in the updated example? I mean what's the magic here with InputType? It only takes away the extra step for specifiying nIn. But not nOut...or not?! 
solution: 

issue: Is there an efficient way to increase an INDArray's rank by 1? Specifically just to add a dimension for batchSize to input and mask arrays I thought adam meant it's unnecessary to set the nout when using input types 
solution: Adam he also mentioned that the sentence classification was an edge case concerning CNN nout. calculating the nIn/nOut to properly couple stuff when using CNNs is one of the reasons why the InputType autocalc for nIn exists.

solution: 

issue: Hi, wondering if there's any way of accessing the output of the final decoder layer in a variational autoencoder.

solution: 

issue: @AndresCubides if you\'re doing full-batch training (not minibatch training), i.e., "all data in one (Multi)DataSet object" then you can just call fit(MultiDataSet) Thank you @AlexDBlack  but indeed I want to use minibatch training not full-batch but i\'m not sure how to do it with the computation graph. 
solution: then the next quickest hack (again, I'd suggest doing it properly) is saving to disk using DataSet.save and using FileDataSetIterator.

Sorry this just seems 1 off  we have people running on windows 10 all the time (including myself) There's got to be something special somewhere It's either the way you're running it or there's an underlying cause we're not seeing.In the past, we've had that be clashing anaconda installs among other things 
solution: 

issue: Rather than running your own project, have you already tried following our quickstart and making sure the standalone sample runs? It normally is, but you're having a 1 in 1 million issue Ok so I wonder what the difference is, it can't be dl4j itself Since normally an issue like that comes down to weird native dependency internal issues on the user's computer That's where you go down the dependency walker rabbit hole We shouldn't have to do that here Could you post a screenshot of your IDE? I'm curious about your project layout Thanks just expand your directory structure

issue: AlexDBlack: with RNNs, the last step takes all previous steps into consideration, right? So for time series analysis, I'm leaning towards option [<-ISSUE->] , does that make sense?

solution: 

issue: Hi@raver119sorry to bother you but did you have any luck with [<-ISSUE->] ? 
solution: 

issue: @ChrisYohannI tried to set an RnnToFeedForwardPreProcessorthat's for doing time distributed dense layers, all it does is reshape the 3d activations to 2d, which is not what you wantyou've already referenced some of my previous comments on this - so use LastTimeStepVertex/Layer on global pooling instead C4N4D4M4N: that 2d shape thing gone on master/snapshots (it was a legacy thing)but the long constructors (not int constructors) should give you 1d or 0d if appropriateif that doesn't work for some reason you can reshape if necessary amersa64: that's a pretty tiny network...though what I actually meant was the ParallelInference configuration 
solution: 

issue: I am using ParallelInfrence for multi-threaded Scoring on CPU with 8 cores. However, when I profiled, it seems that the inference-threads actually block each other and majority of the time is being spent in Wait. Any Suggestion?@AlexDBlack 
solution: amersa64: unless you are feeding in enough data to actually need all threads, then yes, some will be sitting idle most of the time... the point of ParallelInference is (depending on the configuration) to batch inputs to perform a smaller number of forward pass operations with a larger batchbehaviour does depend a lot on your configuration... maybe post that in a !gist. 

issue: AlexDBlack: I'm using 1.0.0-beta3. So, only conv2d is using then? Any plans of expanding it to other BLAS operations? 
solution: the latter is for neural-network specific operations. as for the rest, yes, it's being worked on; a number of other layer types are already implemented at the c++ levelthere needs to be a bit more work to make that available for DL4J.

solution: 

issue: Do DL4J RNN layers automatically read time series data backwards so they don't forget more recent timesteps? I've been manually reversing my time series data, and just recently tested without the manual reverse and performance improved, so I figured I'd ask. 
solution: 

issue: I experience "memory leaking": if I attach-detach a few instances ofInMemoryStatsStoragetoUIServerone after another, free Java heap space starts to decrease. Without visualization, memory is not a problem. My models have at most a few thousand parameters, and I send at most 512 updates to the UI for each model.I expect that detaching a StatsStorage allows for freeing it\'s memory. It seems that in my case, something does not allow freeing this memory.I use DL4J 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT, Java 8, CPU backendAny ideas, how can I track down this issue? AlexDBlack: I have created this issue [<-ISSUE->] about the memory leak in UIServer.

solution: 

issue: I tried both ParameterAveraging and SharedTrainingMaster, on a spark cluster of a master and 2 slave nodesParameterAveraging  takes 8 minutes for training and evaluation per epochSharedTrainingMastertakes almost 30 minutes to achieve the same.How I init them? here : https://gist.github.com/localmaxima/2e735bfd7118212b242b3da8da01f810Per the documentation, I think SharedTrainingMaster should be faster, any tips why it's not the case here? 
solution: 

issue: is it true that if a value is being masked, it doesn't matter what its value is? because I have data that looks like this: [<-LINK->] and it seems that the NaNs and Infinite values in the time series slot (which is being masked) are affecting training/evaluation I'm not sure if I should take it as a sign that my masks aren't being applied, or if they are being applied, but there's some other reason that the non-finite values are messing everything up 
solution: I can confirm, when I eliminate those non-finite values from my data set, everything trains/evaluates as a normal network should. I'm worrying that this means my masks aren't actually being applied.. 

issue: Hi,How can I set batch size? mini batch size I try over network configuration, but that not exist. 
solution: vurosevic: you configure that at iterator level. neural net will use whatever you pass into it. 

issue: Masssssimo: you don't need a dataset object for prediction. you can just pass the raw ndarray (e.g. see the last few code examples here: [<-LINK->] ) epwaudby: sorry, no ETA, but I'm glad you could use what I've done so far :) It used to use even more memory ;) and the multiplicative attention that is still missing should be using less, but I don't quite know when I get to implement it - don't have a lot of time to work on that at the moment 
solution: 

issue: @treo Really enjoyed your vid on Attention nets (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrZ_Y4koV5A) I used your TimeSeries class to enhance an LSTM/RNN model and it DRAMATICALLY improved the results; I was amazed at the difference.You mentioned in the video that you would be putting the code into DL4J proper; is there any ETA on that?On a tangential note, the memory TimestepAttentionLayer uses is MASSIVE. I think in one trial it hit about 2GB in RAM (just before it crashed) I had to reduce the training set by about 50% before it would run properly. Is there any way around this or is it intrisic to the implementation? 
solution: 

issue: Is there a way to profile ND4J off-heap memory usage? chrisvnicholson: I tried that but I don't think it is showing the correct information, in YourKit it shows I am only using about 50MB for Off heap memory but when I check my task manager I can see that 4.5 GB of memory are being consumed. 
solution: 

issue: in additionRNN example, why should the encoderInput be reversed?following are comments in the example:Note that the string is padded to the correct length and reversedEg. num1 = 7, num 2 = 13 will return {"3","1","+","7"," "} AlexDBlack: you are right. I've tried in normal direction,  it does work, thanks. but why it works in reversed direction? 
solution: 

issue: epwaudby: there are no known issues with DataSet.merge, for any rank input (well, up to and including rank 5)what version of DL4J/ND4J? and what OS and backend (native/CPU or CUDA)? fwiw I'm getting all 1s on your code on both 1.0.0-beta3 and current snapshots/masterthat's Windows 10, nd4j-native (cpu) backend 
solution: yeah, that 2017 discussion is irrelevant, almost certainly long fixedhappy to take a look if you can isolate it.

issue: Hi Alex @AlexDBlack DBlack thx for your explenation. So does the picture map to: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] From my understanding one dl4j-LSTM-layer corresponds to one LSTM cell/unit.But in one example I found: [<-CODE->] https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples/blob/master/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/recurrent/character/LSTMCharModellingExample.javaSo can I not use the word cell/unit interchangeably? Would it be better to say one DL4J-LSTM-Layer is one cell and one cell can have several units? But what exactly would one unit be then :(Im sometimes very confused with the terminology. [<-CODE->] Can I influence the size of the state vector in one LSTM-CellAlex: by the definition of what the LSTM is, no. Each LSTM cell/unit/neuron has one memory cellBut this one memory cell can take/output vectors (nIn/nOut) or? So by this, the size is influenceable or not?Im thinking on the following lstm-architecture graphic, where everything is a vector (C state-vector):  [<-LINK->] 
solution: 

issue: Is there a way to use ND4J with on heap memory ? I seeDataBufferhas aHEAPallocation but it has been marked as deprecated basically I'm porting python code into a Java application where everything is done on heap (so almost all the memory is allocated to the heap), and ND4J looked like a nice shortcut if performance is not a concern, wouldn't it be possible to fork all of nd4j-native.jar to use on heap buffers ? 
solution: 

issue: Does dl4j not support InceptionV3 yet? 
solution: 

issue: I've got a weird scenario regarding RNNs not applying their masks to the network during training. FF input data/masks work as expected, but not RNNs for some reason. I did a comprehensive test: [<-LINK->] . I can open this in an issue if needed, but if it's a quick fix, I'd rather not make a big fuss about it. 
solution: 

issue: I have an old GPU (GeForce GT 630M) that is CUDA  8 compatible. Since CUDA 8 is not supported in the latest snapshot, do I have any options? thanks@AlexDBlack 
solution: 

issue: 630M is CC 2.1, with 1 or 2GBeven if you did get it working, it may not be worth the effortwith 289 or 388 GFLOP, that's about 1/10th to 1/15th the performance of a 1060, which is a low end card from last generationin principle, I think you might be able compile ND4J from scratch with CC 2.1 support, if you can run a more recent cuda versionbut that's a very hard and time consuming thing to do hm... that's a method that's been around for a long timeand yeah, I agree it makes sense, I think I'll delete that oneuse the evaluate methods instead, then get the f1 score from the returned Evaluate object hm... it looks to have already been deleted, I don't see it on master C4N4D4M4N: thanks, I've opened an issue and will reply there once I've looked at this in more detail: [<-ISSUE->]

solution: 

issue: Just curious, where does dl4j stand next to some of the other popular Deep Learning libraries like Tensorflow and PyTorch, et cetera? I\'ve heard dl4j be called a "second class citizen" as it doesn\'t get as much development by Data Scientists (as opposed to just regular Developers and Software Engineers). Personally I would like to never touch Python again, so I have a stake in this. I was told that a good year or two ago, so it's probably out of date Who uses dl4j? I'm actually curious about that. I remember Thomas Nield speaking about it with use in Kotlin 
solution: 

issue: off the top of my head, a few that I've heard (I'm not really in a customer facing role these days, so don't have an exhaustive list) - BoA, some groups in Apple, Orange Telecom, NEC, etcquite often it's not just DL4J though, sometimes data scientists will build in python, deploy in Java/DL4J. Sometimes it's just some groups in a company using DL4J. 
solution: right, exactly. There's basically 2 roles we playfirst, there's obviously users who simply prefer to build in java (which is a definitely a minority of data scientists, but still sizable in real terms)second, there's deployment. Some companies are very hesitant to deploy python code (and we've come across a couple that have outright bans on python in production), which is where our import functionality comes in. 

issue: Hi, is there some reference performance data for ResNet50 on Xeon similar to data for AlexNet/VGG/LeNet shown here in [<-LINK->] . I am particularly interested in Inference data for various batch size. AlexDBlack: /@raver119can you elaborate on MKL-DNN being used only by libnd4j and not dl4j? When you have a model with convolution operations, i thought you were already using conv from MKL-DNN. I brought up earlier in this forum about MKL-DNN and Alex I think you mentioned that the snapshot should have MKL-DNN used for LSTM, BatchNorm, Pooling, etc. That was only for nd4j? 
solution: 

issue: i'm afraid you'll  have to do it yourself, we're planning to do benchmarking with MKL-DNN, but we're not there yet and i'm not sure if MKL-DNN was attached to DL4J yet (i know it is used in libnd4j though) cc@saudet^^ 
solution: yeah, no MKL-DNN yet for DL4J (only libnd4j)I need to get to that. and mkl-dnn is used there, thanks to Sam. which doesn't use samediff yet, due to absence of cuda support in many samediff ops.

solution: 

issue: How do you go back to beta-2 version? I cant use calcbackpropgradient function in beta-3 version. so I want to  go back to previous version AlexDBlack: I am working on a project where I am changing loss values we get in feedforward. So i cant directly use model.fit function. So i am calculating feedforward first, changing the loss and calculating backpropagation. But I cant find function to calculate backpropagation AlexDBlack: ok. thanks a lot. I will try that AlexDBlack: where can i feed the updated loss in the function? AlexDBlack: so in that way, if i am backpropagating, will i have to calculate it  every node of every layer? 
solution: Shreyas20: noyou pass in the gradient at the top of the net (again, dL/dA) and it will backprop as normal (for the whole net)think of it as manually implementing only what the output layer (loss layer, technically) would do.

solution: 

issue: Hi, I was wondering if anyone else is having the issue that DL4j training is very slow sometimes? I just had the issue again and simply restarted by java-process, which solved the issue.I don't think its a Java-GC issue, because the CPU usage of my application is 400% (all of my CPUs) and usually GC does not use all cores.Any recommendations what I can do to analyze the issue? I am using 1.0 beta3. And the speed difference is dramatic: It should take 8 minutes for 25 epochs. But when the issue happens it takes 15 minutes and has not even completed a single epoch. 
solution:

I'm left confused, though, because it occurred in a Zeppelin notebook which is specifically (and solely) for Scala. And it is a notebook supplied by DL4J. So I'm wondering if that notebook has ever worked (I certainly assume so!), and if so, why it's now not working for me.

issue: Just upgraded from beta2 to beta3 and getting this issue: deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples#777 (UnsatisfiedLinkError with libmkldnn.so.0)The issue states that it is due to a stray dependency on javacpp 1.4.2. However, I cannot find any such dependency (and I don't link to it directly). I have even deleted javacpp 1.4.2 from my maven repository before a clean build (so can't see that I would now have a copy of 1.4.2 lying about!) and still get the issue. Any ideas? AlexDBlack: Good guess. Is there a 'work-a-round' / solution? AlexDBlack: Oooh.. That old chestnut! I'll go fight with eclipse for a bit then! (not for the first time!)

issue: Hi all, I'm looking to use DL4J with Scala/sbt to load a Keras model for inference. I have an .h5 file and following the doc ( [<-LINK->] ), but when running ClassResourcePath I get a FileNotFoundException. I figure that the file is not in the working directory or I'm not formatting the path correctly. Is there a quick way to verify the working directory? ah, okay, thanks@raver119! 
solution: 

issue: i wonder if your validation thing actually uses workspaces if not - each eval batch will do allocations etc and that might cause perf problems pretty fast

issue: Hi, when running ND4J, I'm getting the following error:java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no jnind4jcpu in java.library.path I\'m usingorg.nd4j" % "nd4j-native-platform" % "1.0.0-beta3 How do I add this dependency? Is there a different version of ND4J I should use? 
solution: And I do have a separate process that calls my DL4J models but that separate process also links some other native libraries. 

issue: krlu: first guess: that's likely a bad uber-jar buildhow exactly are you packaging and running your project?we recommend building using 'mvn package' with maven shade plugin, configured as per the standalone sample project here: [<-LINK->] it should be possible, yes - we've had users use sbt successfully beforeI'm not a SBT user though, so can't really advise on the exact configuration required 
solution:

solution: 

issue: mankeskes: yes - that's called transfer learning, and DL4J has transfer learning helper utilities/functionalityand a couple of !examples for ComputationGraph, yes, you can add new inputs (as MultiLayerNetwork doesn't support multiple inputs)for MultiLayerNetwork you'd need to convert it to a ComputationGraph first (there's a toComputationGraph() method for that) drndos: we've seen issues with alpine linux before, there's a common shared library (can't remember which) that should be listed later in the stack trace so my first guess is that it's nothing to do with the pom file - if you switch to something like centos or ubuntu, it should work it should be possible in principlethere's a common shared library (can't remember which) that should be listed later in the stack tracewhat does the stack trace say about what is missing?

issue: dollarHome: thanks man. now i need more details about what you're actually running there, what's data dimensionality, what's your os, etc also, i'll need you to run the same network on snapshots dollarHome: also, why openblas is used instead of mkl? nvm, that's mkl in current snapshots thing that's 13% should be faster now but barrier locks means that there's too much parallelism used somewhere 
solution: 

issue: what happens if you decrease number of threads for openmp? and what happens if you change thread affinity params? 
solution: I mean, if thats the best I get with this version of DL4J, so it is. I just want to make sure, there is no other knob I didnt leave out to get the best perf. Later when i get MKL-DNN, i can compare that perf with this version with out MKL-DNN. 

issue:  [<-CODE->] I guess that is why you had so many threads just waiting around: they didn't get any new work, because it went to an other openmp runtime. But with the passive waiting mode, your top time eater appears to be a copy operation raver119: any idea why simdOps::Copy2 would be taking over 30% of the time here? [<-LINK->] that does seem a bit unreasonable

issue: Hey, i'm trying to replicate a network I found in a paper using your framework. It is a convolutional network. I follow an (old) baseline code from this paper, written in tensorflow ( https://github.com/tzirakis/Multimodal-Emotion-Recognition/blob/master/models.py  in function audio_model). I also purchased your book 'Deep Learning a practioners approach' to help me build the model correctly. It seems that my code is somewhat the same as on page p186 about the network architecture of the LeNet but I receive this error which I can't get my head around.ConvolutionLayer (index=2, name=layer2) nIn=0, nOut=40; nIn and nOut must be > 0It says in the book I do not have to define the input, but why is it zero?Here is the network https://gist.github.com/arnovl97/058b1b74d3f3d42b1bfbcb9c5c35baf1 Hmm, i see i forgot 'setInputType' so nvm :)

issue: AlexDBlack: I always have low GPU utilization, below %20 I looked into [<-LINK->] and that still doesn't fix my issue, what else could I be missing? this is a link to my code: [<-LINK->] 
solution: in beta3 it used cpu-only op by mistake. you can use current snapshot, that issue is resolved there. 

issue: To confirm that what I am doing is what I think I am doing (vec here is ParagraphVectors):String doodle = "blah bleh bluh"; \nCollection<String> nearestLabels = vec.nearestLabels(doodle, 10); \nINDArray label300Vec = vec.getWordVectorMatrix("Doc_300"); \ninferredDoodle = vec.inferVector(doodle); \ndouble similarity = Transforms.cosineSim(inferredDoodle,label300Vec);This is cosine similarity between the inferred doc from String doodle and the model doc no. 300?  Thanks! 
solution: 

issue: arnovl97: you need to load those INDArray objects into a dataset iterator in order to fit the model and evaluate it. have a look at the INDArrayDataSetIterator it should work, maybe you've got the wrong pair class? it should be org.nd4j.linalg.primitives.Pair

solution: 

issue: AlexDBlack: Hi Alex, is there any advice you could give on how to structure the codefor a denoising autoencoder? MultiLayerNetwork.fit(...) and DataSet are geared towards data / labels, and not data / noisy data. In TensorFlow it is possible to pass (Signal + Noise) and use Signal as a ground truth and optimized based on mean squared error or something similar.

issue: is CUDA 10.1 supported by ND4J? I only see CUDA 10.0 on mvnrepository.com 
solution: 

issue: nothing directly analogous, nowhat's the underlying operation that you want to implement? and what about weights? hm... so I'm having trouble reverse-engineering the math or motivation behind this based on your descriptiondo you have a paper that this is based on?I mean getting sub arrays (INDArray.get()) is straightforward, not sure exactly what subarrays you need there 
solution: RobrechtP: that... doesn't sound physically possibleso no, no ideashappy to take a look if you can't work it out and can provide a way to reproduce it easily.

issue: Is this correct? I'm particularly interested if that's how you get predicted values: [<-CODE->] I think that must be my issue Thank you@AlexDBlack! 
solution: 

issue: Hello, the page [<-LINK->] returned 404 error 
solution: 

issue: The output for regression model is coming in decimal whereas actual value is very different. For eg Age value is 34 and prediction is coming as 0.98. What can be the issue in this case Yes i am using normalization.

issue: ZanderUrq: also, use !gist and do not paste stuff here, nobody will be able to read it properly anyway 
solution: 

issue: you have probably calculated only the memory required for the network alone - while in training you also have to consider: activations, updater state and gradients and obviously your data 
solution: Geokats: you'll need to do that before the output layer. Geokats: I think there's a way to split that layer@AlexDBlack?. 

issue: Is there anywhere I can read about this, to get a slightly deeper understanding of how these alternatives work? Theoretically, that is? 
solution: click those links. 

issue: It seems ND4J's JNI backend in Maven central was compiled against glibc 2.14, so it won't work on CentOS 6 (libc 2.12)... But looking at the CI scripts it looks like it is built in a CentOS 6 Docker image ( [<-LINK->] ) ? mhh nevermind: [<-ISSUE->]

solution: 

issue: frdrchrb: why not simply use a word2vec model within scala? deeplearning4j can be used in scala as well I think you should literally have an option to wrap up the code in scala using the module in github : [<-LINK->] unfortunately I haven't tried it, but I am assuming it should be pretty straightforward considering scala compiles to the JVM as well

issue: I am switching from CPU  -> CUDA but can't get the project to add NDArray for the platform. The POM is using deeplearning4j-core and nd4j-cuda-9.0. Cuda v9.0 and cuDNN are installed and working, as per testing in TensorFlow. Anyone else having this issue? AlexDBlack: Ok, will post to GIST, but I fixed it by adding in nd4j-cuda-9.0 and nd4j-native-platform and deeplearning4j-core, though the documents seem to indicate to use only nd4j-cuda-9.0 OR nd4j-native-platform ( [<-LINK->] ). DL4J is definately using CUDA, though it can't find my cuDNN dll which is in the CUDA bin folder, but haven't gotten that far, just happy to get everything ported from TensorFlow. Results are looking better already :) Thanks for putting out such a nice API with really good documentation. AlexDBlack: POM File that is working: [<-LINK->] korvit0: Hey Alexander, I am using CUDA 9.0 right now 
solution: 

issue: Hi. I did not follow the latest news. How are u with Cuda? Comparable with a year ago. 
solution: 

issue: @korvit0How are u with Cuda? Comparable with a year ago.not sure exactly what you are asking here, but DL4J/ND4J has had full CUDA support for a very long time, and performance comparable to other deep learning libraries (everyone uses cudnn anyway, so it's same underlying code for stuff like convolutional and LSTM layers)the last release (1.0.0-beta3) has CUDA 9.0, 9.2 and 10.0 support for all platforms (win/osx/linux, arm) @amcelroybut can't get the project to add NDArray for the platform.what do you mean? you are having compilation issues, can't find INDArray? or an error during runtime?also post your full pom.xml in a !gist and I'll take a look 
solution: oxue: the size of your JARs really depends on what you includethey can get pretty large if you include native libraries for all OSs (i.e., if you use nd4j-native-platform or nd4j-cuda-x.x-platform)there's also x86/avx/avx2/avx512 for CPU which adds extra space (the upside being best performance everywhere + backward compatibility on older CPUs without avx)is your goal to build the smallest possible JAR for deployment or something?it's definitely possible to cut JAR size down by including only what you really need.
