issue: i'm trying to install appium on windows, but [<-LINK->] aren't that clear.  I'm struggling to find directories that is required to be set as variables on the path. tekisrinivas20: Was that a response to me? If it is, I'm not using node. I've downloaded the Windows appimum GUI. The issues I am having come under the section heading "Additional Setup for Android App Testing". Particularly, bullet number 2.  It says "Install the Android SDK. Set the ANDROID_HOME environment variable to be your Android SDK path and add the tools and platform-tools folders to your PATH variable." I have downloaded Android studio, which apparently includes the SDK. (According to Google's page). But, on Windows, I am not sure what the Android SDK path should be set too. I can't find a directory called 'tools' or 'platform-tools' 
solution: 

issue: i don't think appium is for non technical folks you can definitely use cucumber with appium most pain is in setup if the non-technical folks are not writing actual tests fine but to write selectors and stuff you do need some knowledge i trained an intern at work and she got going in a month or 2 on her own, its always about ROI that should be doable just use cucumber and appium not sure what you mean, do you have experience in setting up cucumber yourself?

solution: somu9: , you’ve started it and it’s listening on port 4723. That’s it.

solution: 

issue: So.. I had to sign WebDriverAgent with my certificate and thats ok for me. But now I would like for other QA testers to use this on their projects/their OSX machines.

solution: 

issue: hey guys. can you give some hints about how to reduce tests running time? main issue that i have is the app has reusable elements, so different sections in my app have the same locators, so my solution was to get all the cells that i need and search for my element to interact with or to check it inside those cells. this is very time consuming. How do you manage this situation? native app i'm not using xpath at all, only name , id's...but my app has multiple reusable elements. so i'll have 10 elements with the same id...and usually i just get all the relevant cells and going through those cells to interact with my desired element...and this takes a lot of time. like 3 minutes for a test (not very complex) 
solution: gczudowski: yes An_Element_name is common name in the screen. and will find multiple entries. also the number of those kind of elements is variable....@Asimk21my_element_name is an unique element under a cell, so this will tell me that i'm in the right cell. An_element_name is the element that i want to click or to populate , interact with him in general.. 

issue: so for now...this issue is a specific to appium testing framework? sigh....i hope 2.0 will be stunning

issue: Hello all.  I am creating a mobile device lab for retail specific devices at my company.  The goal is to dynamically start appium each time a user runs a test on a device.  I don't want to keep appium up and running at all times, and I also want a separate appium session per device to keep things neat and clean.  Currently I am starting appium using ProcessBuilder in java because I don't want to deal with threads and processes in my java application.  So I will have loads of appium processes running at any given time.  I am trying to figure out the best way to kill a specific appium server process.  Since these are external processes to the java application I'm writing, I could get the PID of the process and kill it.  But I was wondering if there is an API call I could make directly to appium to tell it to shut down the server.  I know selenium grid has such a command, but I can't seem to make this work for appium.  I thought this would be a cleaner approach if possible.  Is anyone aware of an API call I could make to the appium server to tell it to shut down?

solution: WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);        WebElement element = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOf(By.id("mention locator value")));The wait should look like this where driver will wait for 10 seconds till your element is not visible. You can also increase the time as per your need. Place this statement before you statement of clicking on "search box ideal text".

issue: Is there any workaround for controlling network for iOS? I'm trying to switch off all internet connections(both wifi and data) at some point of the script execution On android is quite easy since there are methods in the driver itself But when I checked the documentation for iOS it says that those methods are not supported for iOS 
solution: gotcha, then the next best step would be manually doing it... etc. switching app and navigating to settings.. 

issue: give me 2 min. LyubomirStoimchev: : So if I think I understand you want to use Appium to confirm the calendar is in french? What is it currently doing now? The only way I see to test for a locale is by setting is via desired capabilities with "Locale" There's also Language as well that can be set using : language    (Sim/Emu-only) Language to set for the simulator / emulator. On Android, available only on API levels 22 and below LyubomirStoimchev: : Got it. Sounds like you need to get the current date locally from the device in english and then based on that search for language that should show. you have to know the locale first, if you can't get the locale then that's a problem it sounds with the app

issue: hello@hereI'm trying to automate UI testing for a react-native app, using the xcuitest driver for appium and webdriverio. I've been able to validate that the driver can interact with my simulator, but the instantiated driver appears to be missing some functions "err":{"matcherName":"","message":"Failed: driver.contexts is not a function","stack":"    at <Jasmine>\n    at contexts (/tests/authentication.wdio.functional.js:32:62)\n    at <Jasmine>\n    at <Jasmine>\n    at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:160:7)","passed":false,"expected":"","actual":""} missing methods includedriver.element(), driver.elementByAccessibilityId(), driver.getContexts()and methods that work aredriver.queryAppState(), driver.execute(), driver.getOrientation() these are my capabilities: 
solution: 

issue:  [<-CODE->] thephilwells: It's still failing for me too. Also,setContextapparently is not the correct method, and it'sswitchContext. lol, docs for theappium-xcuitest-driver, what is the correct method to set my context to webview from NATIVE_APP? I've triedsetContext()andswitchContext()andcontext()and none of them actually set the context. getContexts()returns the contexts as expected

issue: Hi,Why appium inspector doesn't catch/recognize custom html properties?Details:In my tests I need to know when the app is loaded. So one of our app developers added attribute called "initializationstatus" to the app container div.In my test I'm trying to do this:WebElement mainContainer = driver.findElement(By.xpath("main container xpath")); // this line works as expected. I'm succeeded to catch the element.String appLoadingStatus = mainContainer.getAttribute("initializationstatus"); // this line throws exception: Method threw 'org.openqa.selenium.UnsupportedCommandException' exception.Note that other attribute works as expected for example: mainContainer.getAttribute("selected") return the right valueWhat is the problem here ?

issue: Hi, we are automating a hybrid App with Appium. Currently, we are working on Android. According to Appium's doc, we need set the context to WebView's context before accessing WebView elements. But we found, even we don't changing to WebView context, we can still get the WebView elements and operate the elements in the native way (Appium Inspector also works fine in native way). So wants to know, why it works? Does Appium already support hybrid app without switching contexts? We haven't started on iOS so don't know if this way still works on iOS. We are afraid, someday this way doesn't work and we have to update our codes. Want to get some confirmation about this.
